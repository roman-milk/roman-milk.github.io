Chapter 01 

A naughty game goes wrong 

"Anyone home?" a voice shouted. 

"I'm here!" Florence shouted back. Hearing footsteps padding toward the bedroom, she wriggled her body in anticipation of her husband's arrival. She wanted to jump up and down with the excitement, although that would be impossible in the ludicrously high heels. 

"Oh! Hi, Mrs Fencer," Jack shyly spoke. He stood in the doorway, knowing he should look away, but the image was so enticing. 

"Jack! Hi! I'm so glad someone is here. I need help, come in, please," she whined. 

"Err, what can I, err do for you," he politely replied, trying hard not to stare. 

*** 

Florence felt a wave of embarrassment hit her like a slap to the face. She wanted to tell the young guy to leave, or at least turn around, though it was important to explain away the slutty clothes before he went. The only excuse coming to mind, was the outfit was for a fancy dress party. 

Florence was preparing for her husband, to play a naughty sexy game. She was hypnotized to play at being his dumb trophy wife. The feeling of being dependent upon him, with the embarrassment of others thinking she was a ditzy blonde, was liberating. It had improved their sex lives enormously. 

This week was going to be an extravagant adventure, by booking a whole week in a spa and entertainment complex. It had already started badly when her husband phoned to say he was going to be late, and she should get changed ready for when he arrived. Now this! Her step-sons friend had turned up, while she was hypnotised into taking on the dumb bimbo role. 

*** 

"Like, these shoes, they are so bad with this dress," Bimbo exclaimed. The whining high pitched voice she used was almost as embarrassing as the slutty clothes. 

"They look OK!" he commented. He was looking at the tight dress, ignoring the shoes altogether.. 

"Oh! Gosh! No! Like, yuk, they're so wrong. Can you help me change them, please! It would be a disaster to break my nails, and I can't bend to reach the shoe in this tight dress," she whined. 

Florence and her husband had never played the game with anyone they knew, and this young man certainly did. Jack was her step-son's friend from college, and that left her feeling terribly embarrassed. 

"OK. I guess," he murmured a reply. He couldn't take his eyes off the sexy, figure hugging dress. 

"Well, hold my hands, so I can step back. I'll sit on the bed while you help," the Bimbo said. 

Florence was aghast, as the bimbo drew Jack into helping her. She tried to calm down, so that she could take control of the stupid bimbo. 

Jack warily took hold of her small hands, while she took a couple of steps back in the high heels. He understood what she meant now. It looked as though she was on stilts, and he wondered how it was possible to stand upright in them. 

"Careful! Don't break my nails!" Bimbo warned him. At that moment she fell backwards, sprawling on the bed, pulling him over. 

Florence gazed at him with a look of dismay, as he collapsed on top of her. His face was in her deep cleavage! Thinking the young guy might tell his friends about it, heightened the sense of embarrassment. 

"I see you've met my big tittles!" Bimbo giggled. "Do you like them?" Bimbo asked, thrusting them up at him, like trophies. 

Florence nearly died of shame. She wanted to shrink away from the excruciating predicament. Instead she had to take control of the dumb bitch, before something worse happened. 

"Sorry, Mrs Fencer," he spluttered. 

"I guess no harm done," the Bimbo smiled. "Like, my shoes? The red ones, over there," she pointed out. 

"Yea, sure," Jack answered, with a wavering voice. If it hadn't been his friends mom, it would have been exciting to have his face in such a big pair of tits. It was wrong, and he had the feeling he was in trouble. 

At least he was busy with something, and the dumb bimbo was quiet while waiting. It gave Florence a chance to think. As soon as the shoes were on, the bimbo would be happy and relaxed. It would be much easier to take control at that point. An explanation would have to be made, though digging her-self out of this hole would be difficult. 

He knelt at her feet undoing the leather catch at her ankle. 

"Hey! Be careful guy! Don't ladder my stockings," the Bimbo warned him. 

Jack looked up at her to say something. His hands stopped working, and his mouth felt full of cotton wool. He held her foot and shoe in both hands, inadvertently separating her legs. Maybe they had been like that from when they both fell onto the bed. Surely she should have pulled them together. 

He could see up the short dress, right between her legs! Her bare thighs with blue straps digging tightly into the soft flesh, was fascinating. The tiny white patch of material, covering her golden triangle was enthralling. He had seen pictures of women in magazines with a shaved pussy, yet this was a real one, inches from his nose. 

An already red face turned puce, as though he was about to explode. He felt light headed too. 

"Hey you! You alright, Jack?" the Bimbo asked. 

Florence was in turmoil. The damn bimbo had left her legs open, too stupid to realise this young eighteen year old was staring at her crotch. The bimbo might be oblivious, but she was in an agony of embarrassment over it. What the hell was he thinking of her? His friend's mother was showing off her panties to him. The embarrassment kept her off balance, unable to gather her wits to stop the terrible situation. 

Instead of replying, he tore his eyes away from the delectable sight of her crotch. He fiddled with the clasp, eventually getting the shoe free. Even holding her stocking clad foot was making him hot under the collar. Knowing she was wearing stockings, rather than tights, was a turn on. 

Shit! He would have to be careful, or she would see his hard-on. As he moved to the other shoe, her foot brushed his thigh. It was a shock of imagined static electricity. He sighed deeply, trying to bring his breathing rate down. 

"Are you sure you're alright, Jack," Bimbo asked, with the same bubbly voice, looking concerned. 

"I'm fine, Mrs Fencer," he hoarsely whispered. He had never noticed her long blonde hair before, though he hadn't really noticed her while visiting Phillip. After all, she was Phil's mother, therefore of no interest to him. The big innocent eyes looking directly at him were so attractive he had to look away. 

Looking straight ahead, he couldn't help noticing her thighs again. He hadn't realised how alluring thighs could be. It was all ass, tits, and pussy they talked about at college. Thinking of his face in this woman's tits, stirred him even more. 

He concentrated on removing the shoe, and escaping, before he spurted into his shorts. 

"Right, well done, Jack. The shoes are over there, if you don't mind helping silly me," she cooed. 

"No, of course, yea," he murmured. 

All Florence could do was sit and wait for it to end. She gave up struggling to take control of the bimbo, for she hadn't been able to bring her own emotions down to a manageable level. It was when the bimbo personality got her into trouble like this, that she needed her husband to rescue her. 

He fumbled with the shoe, as it had a different catch, though like the other one it wrapped around an ankle. He fought the urge to look up from the task, losing the struggle more than once. Her thighs were so milky smooth, and soft looking, he wanted to reach up and touch them. 

At last he stood up, away from temptation. The hem was high around her thighs, showing off the stocking tops, though at least her triangle was hidden. He could still see it, burnt into his retina, and forever saved in his thoughts. 

"Help me up, please," Bimbo said, extending her arms out to him. 

This time he braced himself, not daring to fall on the vision of loveliness again. He pulled hard, and she arose like the fabled lady of the lake. Only she kept going, bumping against his chest. He instinctively grabbed her, wrapping his arms around the delectable body. She wobbled on high heels, rubbing her breasts against his t-shirt. 

"Oh! Sorry Jack, clumsy me nearly had you on the floor," Bimbo giggled. 

His nose was touching her cheek. He wanted to kiss her. The ruby red lipstick exaggerated her pouting, full lips. Her perfume wafted over him in a cloud of feminine allure. She stopped swaying, but he still held on tight. The moment became embarrassing, but he just couldn't let go. The feel of her soft breasts against his chest was wonderful. 

"You can let go of me now, I don't think I'll fall," she told him. "I'm such a clumsy thing. I had you on the bed, and now I've had you standing up. Hope you're not cross with silly little me?" Bimbo asked. 

He shook his head, thinking about what she said, in an entirely different way to what she meant. 

*** 

Florence quivered inside, from hearing the bawdy remark. The stupid bimbo was making a fool of her. At least he seemed genuinely shocked from the close contact. He was obviously inexperienced. He would probably have the decency to keep quiet about this at college, not wanting to upset Phillip. 

The worst that might happen was he went home to play with himself. That thought made her feel pitiful. Being the object of an adolescent's hand-job was demeaning. What did she expect, after displaying herself so lewdly to him? 

The point of their time away, was for her to feel embarrassed, and her husband to feel empowered, showing off an attractive blonde. They would each get what they wanted, and have a sex filled week. She felt embarrassed now, only it shouldn't have been with someone she knew. 

Earlier Mathew called to say he was going to be late, so she had to be ready to go, when he arrived home. The only way she could dress like this, was by invoking the hypnotic suggestion. If she had realised how powerful it had become, she wouldn't have. 

A slight tingling between the legs was a warning bell. At least the bimbo was too stupid to realise what she was doing. Florence decided to leave her to it, and ignore what was going on. That way, she wouldn't get so worked up. It was Mathew's fault, so he could sort it out when he arrived, which must be soon. 

Getting hot and bothered from the embarrassing situation, and from being so helpless, was far too dangerous without her husband being near. What if it had been a neighbour? A mature man would more than likely take advantage. It didn't bear thinking about how vulnerable she was to a man's advances. 

Florence remembered a few weeks ago when they stayed at a hotel. A young man talked her out of her panties. He had the bimbo convinced that nylon panties would cause cancer, and that she should remove them immediately. Despite his restrained smirk, the bimbo became so worried, she discreetly removed them, right there in the bar. 

He had helpfully taken them from her, and put them in his pocket. When he advised her to get an immediate check-up, the bimbo became even more worried, as it couldn't be arranged until Monday. Florence knew what was coming next, and worked on the bimbo, trying to get her to go back to the room. 

He cleverly talked the bimbo into asking him to examine her. He reluctantly refused, plainly looking to give in, after another drink. Just as he agreed to take the stupid bimbo to his room, to examine her vagina, Mathew arrived and rescued her. 

She never did tell her husband the young guy had her panties. For the rest of the weekend she had to keep stopping the bimbo from removing her panties. 

*** 

"Oh! Golly, no! These shoes are just too dreadful with this dress," Bimbo petulantly stated. 

Jack couldn't see anything wrong with them. He shrugged his shoulders, preparing to escape. He backed away from her, while she alternately stared into the mirror, and scanned the room for something else to wear. 

"Would you be a wonderful young man, and help me again?" Bimbo asked. 

The wide open, innocent eyes, swayed his better judgement. He just nodded, unable to utter the word, 'anything'. 

"You're so wonderfully kind," Bimbo squeaked. She kissed him on the cheek, swaying dangerously on the high heels. 

He reached forward to steady her, only this time his hand was lower down. It touched her bottom, or at least the side of it, just lower than her hip. He snatched it away, as though it burnt his fingers. 

"In there is a lovely blue dress, with flowers on it, could you fetch it for me," Bimbo said, lowering her eye lids and pouting. She was enjoying having an assistant to help her dress. 

"This one?" Jack asked. 

"Perfect! You're such a clever young man. Now, help me off with this one," she said. "It's too tight, and it won't go with these heels," she added. 

"Err, I could take the shoes off," he suggested. 

"Noooo! I want to see how they look with the lovely blue dress," she whined. 

He looked at her for a moment, wondering what was going on. Was this a wet dream? He was sure Mrs Fencer didn't talk like that, with the squeaky girly voice. Was this woman a stupid sister or something? Maybe she was a twin? 

"All you need to do is hold onto the hem, and pull it up. Right up over my head. Be careful of the stockings, and my nails, and don't tread on the shoes," she instructed. She lifted her arms up and looked at him, expecting the instructions to be carried out. 

As though in a dream, he grabbed a hold of the hem. He had to admit, it was a tight fit. It was like a sheath, hugging the curves of her body. His hands trembled as he pulled the dress up her legs. The stocking tops, straps, then finally the panties and garter belt were revealed. He then had to roll it over her hips, to a slim waist. 

It slipped easily over her flat tummy, then again he had to roll it over her breasts. The little push up bra was a treat to the eyes. Her soft luscious breasts were crushed together into a deep cleavage, in the undercut bra. They were being squeezed and pushed around, as the dress was rolled up over them. 

He had his face in them only minutes ago. Now they were fully on display, with the nipples about to pop out over the top. The stretchy dress was covering her arms and head, when it snagged a bracelet. 

"Oh! Be careful, don't break my sparkly bracelet!" Bimbo complained, in a sing song girly voice. 

Standing close to the almost naked woman, was making him feel light headed. She swayed against him as he fiddled with the garment and jewellery. He stood back a moment, taking a deep breath. He could safely stare at the beautiful body, while her head and arms was stuck in the dress. 

His eyes were drawn from her stocking clad feet, up her shapely legs encased in sheer nylons, to the creamy white thighs. Suspender belts dug into the thighs, clasping the stocking tops, pulling them tight. A delicate triangle of silk pursed her lips, holding them in an enticing grip. 

Up over her flat tummy he rove, stroking her soft pure skin with his eyes. Her breasts were held firmly in a small push up bra. He remembered the softness of them against his face, though now it was safe to watch them heave with every breath she took. 

Florence took advantage while the Bimbo was just waiting in the dark, with a vacant mind. 'Listen to me! You are under my control,' Florence implored. It would be terribly embarrassing, standing before Jack as herself, but something had to be done. This just couldn't carry on. 

Jack pulled the dress from her head, and dropped it on the bed. She just stood there looking dazed. It looked as though she were hypnotized. It struck him like a lightening flash! He remembered Phillip telling him about his parent's hobby. They performed an act at charity events, to raise money for charity. If he remembered right, that's where Philip's parents met. Mr Fencer was lucky to have such a beautiful young wife. 

"Mrs Fencer! Listen to me! Are you all right?" he stated slowly, as though she were a simpleton. 

"Nearly," Florence replied. She hadn't regained control yet, being in an awkward half stage between the Bimbo personality and herself. 

"Are you hypnotised?" he slowly asked. 

"Yes," she dreamily replied. 

"Don't worry, I'll help you. Just do as I say, and everything will be alright. Do you understand?" he firmly told her, trying to sound reassuring. 

"I think so," she said, responding to the reassurance, while wondering what he meant. 

"I'll take care of you, just do as I say and it will be alright," he firmly stated. 

Shit! She was nearly free of the damn Bimbo. Now he was going to try and help her, which she really didn't need. What did he think he was doing? 

She just stood there looking dazed. He couldn't think what to do next, only knowing he would have to do something. He couldn't leave her like this. Not only that, if she awoke with him here, while she was in just a bra and panties, it would look so very bad. She must have been practising some sort of role for a show. 

"Carry on as before, being who you were before, only you must do as I tell you," he said, trying to sound as though he knew what he was doing. 

"Sure, OK!" Bimbo giggled. 

Florence cringed inside with a dreadful feeling this was going to end badly. Damn the stupid boy, she had nearly been free of the dumb girl. 

"You had better take those shoes off, and put some sensible ones on," he ordered. 

He didn't want her running around like a slut, when her husband, or Philip returned home. If she told them he had been helping her get dressed, and had her on the bed, he would be in trouble. Phillip wouldn't talk to him again, and if his mother found out he would be grounded for the rest of summer. 

He would have to search the internet for a solution. That was it! Wipe her memory of his involvement, and snap her out of this state. 

He glanced at her smiling face, and couldn't help staring at her luscious body. He would have to dress her in something sensible, then take her home. When his mother arrived she would wonder what he was doing with a neighbour in his room. Dressed like this she would have something to say for sure. 

"Here put this on. No! Don't take the underwear off. Wait! Tell me when you're dressed," Jack firmly told her. He left the room, to impatiently hover outside. 

"Ready! I don't like this one bit. Its, so ordinary, it's shabby," Bimbo complained. 

As far as Florence was concerned it was a great step forward. The flat shoes and simple dress was ordinary, and very welcome. Well done Jack! 

"Oh! Alright, if you're sure," Bimbo answered. 

No! Don't leave the house! Florence desperately needed to take control right now. It wasn't safe for her to be outside. The stupid bitch would get into some dreadful situation. It would be embarrassing to be seen like this by a neighbour. To meet a friend or relative would be humiliating. 

Florence didn't know what to do. She had left it too long before trying to regain control of the bimbo. Now the bimbo was the dominant one, in control, making the decisions. As stupid as they might be, she was going to have to live with the consequences. 

'Please! Don't go outside,' Florence silently whimpered. Coming into contact with others, without the protection of her husband, would be dangerous. 

She would be giggling like a moron, showing herself up before everyone. This would have been exciting in a place where no one knew them, and with her husband looking after her. Here in the neighbourhood it could be disastrous. She might never live it down. 

Shrinking away into a corner of her mind, she let Jack guide her. Fortunately they didn't meet anyone on the way to his house. Her friend, Jack's mother, was out, which was a big relief. 

"Just sit there while I try to work this out," he told her. 

It was reassuring that he wanted to help, yet all he had to do was ask. She could tell him exactly what to do, as it just needed a phrase to be spoken to bring her out of this mess.  

===

"Like, yuk, I can't just sit here doing nothing. I'm bored!" Bimbo exclaimed. Florence had told the bimbo to hurry Jack along, and tried to get her to go home. Instead the stupid thing had declared she was bored. 

"Here, chew this gum," he absently told her. 

"Ooo! Cool! Pink!" Bimbo cooed. She sat there contentedly chewing, blowing a bubble, and popping it. A little squeal of pleasure erupted whenever a large bubble burst. 

Florence felt so small and pathetic. Surely this couldn't go on. She willed him to forget the internet search, and ask her what to do. She was gradually regaining control, while the stupid one was preoccupied with chewing gum. Thankfully it didn't take much to distract the bimbo. 

She was very nearly ready to speak out, to tell Jack the release phrase. It was difficult to break into the damn chewing, and blowing routine. At last the gum was pushed into a cheek, for Florence to try speaking. 

The internet was no help at all. It had been a stupid idea. How in hell could he learn the techniques of hypnosis in five minutes. 

"Tommy, he'll get me out of this mess," Jack murmured. "Come on, we're going," he told Mrs Fencer. 

"Err, like where we going now?" Bimbo squeaked. As bad as it was being away from home, she didn't want to leave the relative safety of his room. 

"Can't we stay here? I can blow for you, I like to blow, can I blow for you?" the Bimbo chirruped, with a bouncy girly voice. Florence was influencing the stupid thing, but it kept getting in the way of what she needed to say. 

Jack took no notice. He grabbed her hand, pulling her out of the chair. "Come on! Do as you are told, be a good girl," he commanded. 

He needed to get rid of the woman before his mother got home. It would be difficult to explain away, having Mrs Fencer here like this. He was sure to get the blame. He stopped by the front door, wondering if he should seek his friends help, or just dump her at home. 

"I'm going to take you home. You can wait there until . . . Maybe it will wear off or something," he said, with a shrug of his shoulders. 

Florence relaxed. Waiting at home for her husband would be ideal. Jack had been careful leading her here, so maybe they wouldn't meet anyone going home. The bags were packed, so all they had to do was drive to the resort. 

"Hey Jack!" Mr Fencer shouted. 

Shit! He shoved her further back into the house, out of sight. 

"Hi!" he shouted back. Her husband was directly outside the house, leaning out of the car window. 

"If you see Florence, tell her I've gone ahead. We'll meet at the resort. OK?" he said. 

"Oh! Yea! OK!" he shouted back. 

Florence heard her husband, and immediately wanted to shout to him. It didn't matter what he said, she would just have to live with the jokes and jibes. He would remind her at every opportunity, she had been a young guys silly little bimbo. The thought stopped her running to him, for just a moment. 

With a strength of will, she pushed the bimbo forward, impelling the stupid girl toward the open door. "Ouch!" Bimbo exclaimed, as she collided with the door. 

Florence heard her husband drive off. In an agony of dismay, the finality of the chance of freedom closed in on her. She watched the door slam shut, feeling despair overtake her. 

"You OK?" Jack asked. 

"Silly me. I ran into the door," Bimbo whimpered. 

Jack took her in his arms to cuddle her. He couldn't leave her at home now. There would be no one to look after her. There was no telling what trouble she might get into. Even in flat shoes she was a walking disaster. Damn! He would have to find Tommy, get her sorted out, then send her off to her husband. 

Florence sat quietly while Jack drove. It was damnably infuriating. He was doing his best, trying to help her, but he needn't have bothered. Having repeatedly told her to do as she was told, left her all the more under the hypnotic influence. It didn't help being told to be a good girl. 

The pool hall didn't look too bad, and it wasn't likely she would meet someone she knew. It just wasn't home, where she wanted to be. 

"Hi Tommy. Am I glad to see you!" Jack enthused. 

"Hi! Who's the girl?" he said, without looking at his friend. He stared her up and down. 

"That's why I'm here. She's hypnotised and needs to be de-hypnotised, or whatever you call it," Jack tried to explain. 

"What? I didn't know you were into it," Tommy queried. 

"I'm not. A friend did it, and now I'm stuck with her. I need you to bring her round," he lied. 

"What's her name? I need to know a few details," Tommy thoughtfully spoke. Hypnosis was a hobby, and he wasn't very good at it, though it wouldn't be admitted. 

"Candy," he lied. He didn't want Tommy blabbing that he had Mrs Fencer in this state. He was in enough trouble as it was. 

Florence was somewhat relieved. If this young guy knew anything at all, she would soon be on her way home. 

"Come into the office. I'm in charge while my dad is away," Tommy proudly stated. 

"Will it take long, I've got to get home before mom," Jack said, while looking at his watch. 

Tommy knew it wasn't his mom he was worried about. He got into trouble with a couple of the guys from the pool hall, so was now on a curfew, enforced by the juvenile court. He smirked, but didn't say anything. 

"I can't just snap my fingers. It's complicated. I need to know what it is, what the suggestion is," he pointed out. 

More than that, he wondered if he could do anything at all. It would shatter his image if he failed to impress. Jack was slumming it with the pool room crowd, and would probably reveal the failure to them. It would be a joke with them, and infuriating for him. He was the geeky owners son, so tried to impress them with his powers of persuasion, though it had all been a bit of a hit and miss performance. 

"She's been hypnotised to think she's a dumb blonde. Can you get her to forget I was involved?" Jack nervously asked. 

Tommy wondered what Jack had been up to. He had already got out of his depth with the rough crowd in the pool hall. Perhaps he had messed with her, and didn't want the boyfriend to know. 

"Sure, given some time. It might take a couple of hours, to do that," he explained. 

Tommy looked at his watch, and at his mom's friend. She looked just young enough to get away with being around their age group. Not young enough to be hanging out with him, though he didn't much care what Tommy thought. He dare not tell him who she really was. 

"I just need you to snap her out of it, and send her home. Can you do that?" Jack asked. 

"Sure, no problem. You go home, before your mom gets in. Leave it to me. I'll send her home, without her knowing she left, is that OK?" Tommy reassured him. 

Florence was frightened. She wanted to shout at Jack, but the bimbo was blocking her out. The bimbo was going along with whatever Jack told her to do. 'Please don't leave me here,' she wanted to scream. 

"Hey Jack, like, I wanna to go home with you," Bimbo declared instead. 

She swung her hips from side to side, looking up through sultry eyes, trying to get her own way. The girly tone of voice grated with Florence, but she was willing the girl on, to prevent being left there. Couldn't Jack see the way the guy was looking at her? He was almost licking his lips, ready to devour her. 

"No! Stay here and do as you are told, Candy," Jack firmly stated. 

All he wanted was to be rid of the problem. He took a hold of her shoulders and looked sternly in her face. The stupid bitch could cause him trouble, and he was in enough as it was. She was just the type of neighbour to go and complain about him to his mom. Mrs Michael, complained about the weekend party. The police turned up, everyone disappeared, and he was left with the problems. 

"Candy, do as Tommy tells you, OK?" he carefully emphasised every word. 

"OK!" Bimbo timidly acknowledged. She looked down at the scuffed flooring, looking hurt. 

Tommy wondered if Jack had accidently hypnotised her, while playing around. Though she didn't seem to be his girlfriend, from the way he was so eager to abandon her. It must be a friend's girl as he said. 

"I'll be home if you need me," Jack crossly said, and left. 

Florence was working on her, trying to get her to forget about obeying anyone, and to listen to her. 

"Hi! I'm Candy. Do I really have to, like, do as you tell me?" Candy petulantly asked. 

"Yes you do," Tommy quickly replied. He needed her co-operation, though what he was going to do with her escaped him. 

"That's no fun," Candy complained. 

"Well you have to do as I say, so I can, err, help you," Tommy emphasised. 

Tommy looked her over yet again. She was just the kind of girl who shunned him for being a geek. They were too busy primping their hair for a footballer, or a school hunk, to talk to him. Not that he had ever tried to talk to them. He went for the studious type, someone who could hold a conversation. 

He was unsure what to do with her. If he really could snap her out of this it would impress him, let alone anyone else. He had to do something, so made a start. 

"You're a pretty little blonde, aren't you," Tommy told her. 

"Am I?" Bimbo asked. "Do you really think I'm pretty," Candy giggled. 

"Oh! Yea! You're a gorgeous bimbo," he added, with a big grin on his face. 

"Yes! Candy is a gorgeous bimbo, I like that," Candy smiled back. 

This isn't what he had meant to say, it just tripped off his tongue. How could he react any differently to a big busted blonde. She was definitely over eighteen, though it was difficult to say how much older. He couldn't remember if Jack had an older brother, which might explain who she was. 

Florence was frustrated from having her influence misdirected. The damn bimbo personality was getting in the way, distorting what she wanted it to do. 

"Do you have a boyfriend?" he asked. 

"No!" Bimbo giggled. 

Florence didn't like the direction of the conversation. Being told to do as she was told so strongly, wouldn't help to wrest control back from the stupid one. 

His interest veered away from who she was, toward what she was. A dumb blonde, Jack had said. Well, she reacted like one, and it was a convincing act. To test how deep the influence was he decided to see how far she could be pushed. If pushed beyond its limits, the hypnotic control might break. 

"What do you like to do, Candy?" he asked. 

"Oh, lots of things, really. I like makeup, gum, doing my hair, dressing up, shoes, like, I just love shoes," Bimbo joyfully giggled. 

Florence tried to keep calm, letting the fool babble. 

"What kind of shoes do you like, Candy?" he prompted. 

"Like, not these, I love bright high heels. This dress is so drab, like it's so bad," she grimaced. 

"If you don't like it, why are you wearing it?" he asked. 

"Really, I just don't know. I just hate it! I like pink. Everything pink is fab!" she enthused. 

"If you hate it so much you had better take it off," he suggested. The idea was both exciting, and might work to push her too far. 

"I'm not sure? Does that mean you'll get me something in pink," she coyly asked. 

"I might do," he replied. 

"You won't think I'm naughty will you? I'm supposed to be a good girl. I guess I'm to do as you tell me. OK then," she said. 

She looked as though something was wrong, but couldn't work it out. Maybe this would push her beyond the limits of the influence she was under. 

"Like, you promise? To get me a nice pink dress?" she asked, with her hands gripping the hem. 

"Sure, whatever you want," he promised. 

"Cool!" she exclaimed, in a high pitched voice. 

Tommy watched the unveiling of her body. The dress was caught under her breasts and she just pulled harder, lifting them up, almost under her chin. Inevitably the dress sprung up over her head, letting her breasts bounce free. They sat on top of the bra, with the nipples pointing at him. 

"Nice tits! So very nice," he murmured. 

He had spoken his thoughts out loud, and felt embarrassed over the rude remark. The feeling was pushed aside as she stood before him in a tiny bra and panties. The stockings with suspenders were amazing. 

"Do you like them?" Bimbo asked. 

Florence hadn't been listening, while trying to think of a way to break into the bimbo personality, and take back control. She was taken by surprise when the dress was pulled off. Standing before a stranger in her underwear was horrible, and so very wrong. 

This young guy wasn't so innocent and nice as Jack. It seemed she was becoming a bystander to what was going on, without the slightest control. Both ideas collided to mean big trouble. 

"What?" Tommy spluttered. He had been staring at her breasts. Not only that, she had heard him admiring them. 

"Yes, they're magnificent. Lovely," he explained. 

She looked down at them, and opened her eyes wide in surprise, seeing her nipples on show, "Oh! Sorry, sir," she exclaimed. "Candy is being a naughty girl," she demurely spoke. 

"Stop! No need to cover up such beautiful tits," he grinned. He was no longer pushing her to break the hypnotic influence, he was enjoying himself too much. 

"You sure? Someone's telling me to cover myself up," Bimbo worriedly said. 

"Don't you worry about that. Ignore them, such lovely tits deserve to be shown off," he told her, thinking it was her conscience inhibiting her. 

"Am I a slut?" she asked. 

Florence was desperately trying to get the bimbo to cover up. The stupid girl couldn't see, or didn't care what she was doing to the young guy. She was a mature married woman, showing off her body like a slut. In a panic she shrieked at the bimbo that she was behaving like a slut. 

"Yep! I think you are. Don't worry about it. You're a wonderful slut, with big bouncy tits. You're a marvellous blonde bimbo, a fabulous bimbo. Don't take any notice. Don't listen to that nagging inner voice. To be a good girl you just have to do as you're told. Just do as I say and you'll be a good girl," he said, with a big grin on his face. 

"Do you really think I'm wonderful and marvellous?" Bimbo beamed back at him. 

"You certainly are. You're a lovely blonde bimbo, and a perfect slut," he laughed. 

"Oh! Like, thank you, sir," Bimbo bounced up and down, shaking her breasts at him. 

Playing the game had given Florence a sense of freedom, allowing her to behave badly. Freeing her breasts for a young guy to ogle, hadn't been a part of the plan. Florence desperately tried to calm herself, in preparation to fight the next disgusting event. 

"What should I do with the dress, sir?" she demurely asked. 

Tommy hadn't even been aware she was still holding it. "Just put it in the filling cabinet, the bottom draw," he told her. 

Florence warned her not to bend over so rudely. This time the bimbo didn't take any notice at all. She tried hard, but couldn't influence her in the slightest way. The damn boy had told the bimbo to ignore her, and the stupid bitch was doing it. Hell! What was she to do now? 

Instead of being free of her inhibitions, she was trapped. Florence was a responsible married woman, trapped inside a stupid bimbo. She had always envied other girls wearing low tops, as her breasts had been too big, even before college. She looked slutty if she wasn't careful what she wore. Perhaps that's where it all started. The naughty games, allowing the slutty behaviour, was how she had wanted to behave all these years. 

Tommy was watching her bend over the bottom draw of the filing cabinet. Struggling to pull it open, her hips and cheeks wriggled from side to side. The panties were disappearing between the glorious globes of her ass. Eventually the show came to an end as she dropped the dress into the draw. 

"Has anyone taught you how to bend properly?" he asked, with a smirk on his face. 

"Err, no, don't think so. Like is there a different way? Oh! Do you mean like a cheerleader?" Bimbo eagerly bounced up and down, waving her arms in the air. 

He watched her tits settle as she calmed down. "Yea! That's right. Do you want me to train you?" he artfully asked. 

"Oh, wow, like yeah! For sure! I'd just love to be a cheerleader. All those glitzy clothes and stuff," she again bounced her large breasts in his direction. 

"OK! Let's do it," he laughed. "Stand with your legs apart, further. Now bend forward," he instructed. 

He was leaning against the desk, when she fell forward. He caught her by her breasts, gripping them so she didn't land on her face. Not that he needed an excuse to grab a hold of a luscious body. 

"See if you can touch the floor," he told her. Her face brushed his jeans as she descended. All the time he helped her, by holding on. Reluctantly he let go, to walk behind her. 

She turned her head to look at him. "Is that OK? Did I do it right?" she asked, with a worried look on her face. 

He studied her crotch where the panties clung to her lips. This close he could see a wet patch. Through her legs he could see her breasts hanging, like udders needing milking. That was a delightful thought, shelved for later. He wondered if he dare hold back any longer, as he was more than ready. 

"Almost perfect. Can you straighten your legs? Your knees are bent," he commented. 

He watched her bottom bounce up and down, while she tried to lock her knees. Her breasts jiggled around under her, with every failed attempt. 

"Let me help," he said. 

"Oh! Yes please, sir. Whatever it takes, I'll do. I have to do as I'm told, so just tell me. I'd love to be trained," Bimbo gushed with enthusiasm. 

"Well, it looks to me like these panties are too tight. You should take them off. After all you did say you would do anything," Tommy suggested, with a wish and crossed fingers. 

"Oh! The voice in my head is shouting at me again," Bimbo complained. He lifted her head in both hands. Take no notice, ignore it, you can't hear it. 

Florence had screamed at the stupid one, not to dare remove her panties. She had almost regained control, when the obnoxious boy spoke. The bimbo personality was listening to him, and was trying hard to ignore her. Shit! The bimbo was following his instructions. The bimbo was blocking her out. 

Fuck! She knew it had been on his mind, to fuck the bimbo, but it was her body he was going to use. Florence whimpered in a corner of her own mind, giving up for the moment. No! Please, don't let him fuck me, please! He's just a young ruffian, a guy from the wrong side of town. It's bad enough letting him make me perform these rude exercises. Surely he won't fuck me! 

"Are you sure, sir? You won't think I'm rude, will you? I'm not supposed to be naughty, I'm supposed to be a good girl," Bimbo asked. She hesitated, with her thumbs in her panties. There was something wrong with what she was doing, but she so wanted to be a cheerleader. 

"You were told to be a good girl, and do as you were told. So be a good girl and let me train you properly. Do as you are told, quickly," Tommy demanded. 

He watched her reluctantly pull them off, and hand them to him. "Good girl! Now try bending over with your hands on the desk," he nervously said. 

With legs spread she bent over, leaning against the desk. The sight of her cute ass, with pussy lips protruding was truly wonderful. 

"Your still stiff and need to be more subtle with the movements. I'll massage your muscles, to help you." Tommy said, with a groan. 

"Thank you, sir," Bimbo said. 

Tommy massaged her thighs over the stocking tops. It was impossible to resist pushing his fingers between her lips. 

"Err? Sir? Do you need to do that? That's my naughty bits," Bimbo asked. 

"Does it feel good?" he heavily whispered. 

"Well? Like, yes, it's nice, mmmm, very nice, sir," she replied, starting to respond. 

No! Please don't let him do that. Florence couldn't escape the arousal flooding through her body. The bimbo wouldn't resist, and she had lost the ability to fight, even if the bimbo would listen. She felt every sensation. A stranger was rubbing her lips, sexing her up, without a chance of stopping him.  

===

"You've done very well, lovely bimbo. Candy is such a sweet delight. Here's your reward for being such an obedient little slut," Tommy whispered in her ear. 

"Oh! Sir! What are you doing? That is so good!" she yelped. 

She felt so tight, gripping his cock, pushing back on him, as he buried deep into her vagina. 

Florence was overwhelmed by arousal, unable to hide from her bodies reaction. She too was experiencing a young guys cock penetrating her, taking her, driving hard into her mind and body. She let the bimbo speak and act for her. 

"Do you like that, slut?" Tommy groaned. 

"Yes! Candy wants more, do me more, sir," she whimpered. 

Reaching in all the way he pulled back, with her vagina holding on, gripping his cock tight. 

"Candy doesn't want your cock to leave, sir. Candy wants more, please, sir!" she wailed. 

Tommy drove home, pushing and pulling on her hips with both hands and heaving with his legs. He penetrated deeply into her body, fucking her for dear life. Her enthusiasm spurred him on. He held on, wanting it to last forever. 

"Oh! Sir! Candy is exploding!" she yelled. 

No longer able to hold on, he spurted his load deep into her. His legs juddered as he cum, great streams of sperm rippling from the tiny eye of his cock. 

Florence collapsed over the desk, wasted, unable to move. The bimbo recovered first. She was strong and in charge, no longer prepared to have her fun interrupted by the voice. She was bubbly and beautiful. She was full of life. Wanted more of everything the world had to offer. 

"Sir! That was wonderful. What happened?" she asked, with bubbly enthusiasm. 

"You had an orgasm," Tommy smiled. 

No-one was that stupid. The hypnotic influence was far too strong to be from a one off session. She must have been hypnotised over many months. It must be something she wanted, otherwise she would have fought it, and broken free. 

He knew that much, from what he had learnt from Uncle James. The question he faced now, was what to do with her. 

"Like, wow! Can sir give Candy another scrummy orgasm, please?" she giggled. 

Perhaps he could pass her on to someone else, just as Jack had dumped her with him. He didn't want to be around when she came out of this state. Uncle James had warned him about the legal issues. A subject could claim in court they had no control whatsoever, despite the research showing otherwise. 

"Not now. I'm not ready," he murmured. 

Florence didn't care what the bimbo wanted. This young guy had fuck her! The shame of it hammered home painful nails of guilt into her mind. She let go, not caring what the bimbo did or said. 

"Oh! Please! Candy would love another one just like that," she burbled, in a girly voice. 

The sound of raised voices in the pool room, penetrated his thoughts. If she wanted more, that might be the solution. They could certainly take care of a stupid bimbo. 

"Get dressed, Candy," he firmly told her. 

"Can't you train me some more. It's fun! Candy likes doing as she's told," she giggled. 

He tried not to look at her cute bottom wiggling, as she made a straight legged bend, while delving into the filling cabinet. She pulled on the dress, forgetting about her panties. 

She pouted at him, wrinkling her face up in disappointment, when he took hold of her hand, and opened the office door. 

Florence whooped with joy, encouraging the bimbo to go with him, not that she was listening. Being sent home where she would be safe was paramount. It would take time to recover, but left alone with the bimbo she could take back control. 

"Hi guys, had a good game?" Tommy asked. 

There were four of the gang, standing around looking as though he had interrupted an argument. They never caused trouble here, knowing his father had enough muscle to ban them, and make it stick. Even though he was away, and the dorky son was left in charge, they kept to the rules. 

As one they turned toward Florence. 

They were looking at her like hungry wolves, ready to pounce on the prey. She was the intended prey, with only the bimbo to defend her. They could easily outwit the stupid bimbo, and it was her body they wanted. 

She was a mature married woman, and so they should treat her with respect. With her experience and education she could put them in their place. The right word or two to put them down, or even threatening them would be possible. Instead she was in great danger from this pack of hungry wolves. She was in such a panic she couldn't control her own racing thoughts, let alone the bimbos dim- witted ideas. 

The bimbo would giggle and be dazzled by them. They would soon be taking her, one after another. She desperately tried again to get through to the bimbo. Please! Don't leave me here! Please help me, please! Don't let them take me, Florence whimpered.

Chapter 02 

Florence is in desperate trouble 

(Florence has been hypnotised to be a dumb bimbo called Candy. Florence has lost control of the bimbo personality, and can only observe what is happening to her. She hasn't given up trying to guide the bimbo out of trouble, though it has become increasingly difficult.) 

* 

Tommy was pleased with their reaction. The four guys were looking at his conquest, with obvious admiring looks, though the intensity of the stares was unsettling. They totally ignored him, which is not what he wanted. He wanted them to know this beautiful girl was his, with the expectation of his credit rising. 

It was probably better not to tell them she was hypnotised. It was more of a boost to his credibility to let them think she was stuck on him. It would spoil the effect if they found out he had tricked her into it. He was feeling full of confidence, after screwing her in the office, though it was disappointing they weren't praising him for having such an attractive girlfriend. 

"Bring the slut over here, Tommy. We'll take care of her for you," they laughed. "We've got big sticks, not like you're wiener," they joked, while waving the pool cue's. 

Florence was terrified. The stupid kid, Tommy, was showing her off to these tough gang members. He wouldn't be able to protect her if they decided to take her away from him. The way she was dressed announced she was a stupid blonde slut, and they'd got the message. 

"Nice tits, girl," one of them commented. The others joined in, describing her body, in crude terms. 

"Nice ass, can I have it?" 

"Don't listen to him, I'll fill your cunt with red hot cum," another said, with appropriate pool cue actions. 

Their remarks were getting more bawdy when neither of them objected. They obviously didn't think much of Tommy. 

Florence desperately tried to get through the hypnotic influence, securely binding her into playing what was supposed to be, just a naughty silly game. Her role was to play at being a dumb bimbo, only it had all gone horribly wrong. Instead of being under her husbands protection, she had ended up here, in a rough pool hall. 

The stupid bimbo personality didn't help the dangerous situation. Candy stood there wiggling her hips, thinking they were complimenting her. Candy was too stupid to understand that being called a slut was an insult. 

'Don't go over to those naughty boys, they have big sticks and might smack you,' Florence urgently told the bimbo. 'You belong to Tommy, stay with him, you must go with Tommy," she encouraged. 

Florence had lost control of the Candy personality, so had to try and persuade her into getting away. It was terrible losing control of her own body. She had been reduced to nothing more than an inner voice, and Candy had been told to ignore it. The bimbo personality had become dominant, leaving her as an observer of what was going on around her. 

At last the bimbo seemed to get the message. "Tommy? Like, when you did me, what was it? Oh, yea, an orgasm. I mean, you took me and kinda, well, that made me yours?" Bimbo quietly asked. 

"Err, yea, I guess so," Tommy answered. He didn't like what they were saying about her. He felt jealous, even though he had been contemplating getting rid of her. 

"So, like, I belong to you now," Bimbo spoke, with the usual girly voice, only less bubbly. She was trying to make sense of that inner voice she heard, not understanding it was Florence, the woman she usually was. It was just too confusing for her. She tugged on his shirt, trying to get his attention. 

"I should go with you then. I don't like those naughty boys," she moaned. "I want to go home with you, please. Take me home!" she complained. 

Florence sighed with relief. In a twisted way, Candy had responded to her insistent guidance. Once released from the hypnotic influence she would never, ever, play this game again. It had become too strong, from playing it so often. With her husband around to guide her, she hadn't notice how out of control she was. 

"We'll take you home, girl," they laughed. "Do you want us to take you one at a time, or all at once?" they laughed, though it sounded threatening. "We'll make you our gang slut, what do you say?" the leader asked, with a nasty leer. 

"Go away, your naughty boys," Candy told them. 

They creased up with laughter. Tommy made a quick exit, pulling her with him. 

"So where do you live?" Tommy asked. 

He knew she was hypnotised, but who she really was, was a mystery. Having taken advantage of her, he figured he was in trouble when she came round. The best bet was to get rid of her, while still hypnotised, with the hope she wouldn't remember him. 

Florence hadn't thought about this. She certainly wanted to go home, with the safety that would bring. Having him take her there, would mean him discovering who she was. He would find out she wasn't a young nineteen year old, but a married woman. 

If it got out what had happened, that they had sex, it would be devastating. A young guy like this would be sure to brag to his friends, and that would be the end of her reputation, and marriage. The humiliation of letting him take her, shook her once more, now the danger of the pool hall was over. 

Again she tried to get through to Candy, needing to prevent another disaster. Don't let him take her home, was the message she tried to get through to the bimbo. She then needed the stupid one to get a taxi home, and safety. 

"Candy don't want to go home, like, Candy wants you to look after her," Bimbo whined. 

"What about your parents, won't they expect you home?" Tommy asked. 

"Don't live with parents, don't have any," Bimbo told him. 

"What about a boyfriend?" he asked. 

"Didn't have one. You're my boyfriend, I belong to you now," Bimbo pouted. "Like, you made Candy orgasm, I liked that," Candy giggled. 

Damn! The bimbo was still following the previous instructions. Florence wondered how to get her to follow another track. She had pushed for a taxi, only to have that part of the message ignored. 

Tommy had already worked out no-one could be that stupid. It was part of the hypnotic suggestion. What he couldn't understand, was why someone would want to subject themselves to such an idiotic role. Surely she would have shrugged it off, if she wanted to. 

He arrived home, and just sat in the car, wondering what to do with her. His father was back Monday from the conference. He suspected it was a dirty weekend rather than business. That was exactly why his mother had left them some years ago. The house looked lonely, even more than usual. 

Florence was still working hard to get Candy sent home in a taxi. The simple idea, to just get him to send her home, wasn't getting through. The bimbo seemed fixed on the idea that she belonged to Tommy, after he made her his. 

"You can stay the weekend, then I'll have to send you home," Tommy explained. 

"Oh! For sure, great, like, Candy will love staying with her Tommy," Candy gushed, and wrapped her arms around him, for a sloppy smooch. 

Florence was half way there, for he had said he would send her home. However, the idea of staying a weekend with this kid was terrible. The damn bimbo was all over him, though she noticed he was more reluctant than before. Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad after all. 

Then it dawned on her. In the morning she would wake up free! Just avoid anything nasty happening this evening, and tomorrow she would be home and safe. For a moment she thought of joining her husband, at the weekend resort they had booked. How could she? After what she had done, it would be impossible. She left the bimbo to get on with it, while she dealt with a sharp pain of guilt. 

"Candy, are you finished in there?" Tommy asked. 

"Yes, sir!" Candy chirpily answered. There was a crash of crockery hitting the floor, with the whirring noise of a spinning plate slowing down. "Nearly, sir," Candy nervously added. 

"Damn! What's the stupid bitch broken now?" Tommy wondered, with an ever growing annoyance. 

Florence kept telling Candy, Tommy would be pleased with her, if she cleaned up the kitchen. It was a way of keeping away from him, and it seemed to be working. The breakages couldn't be helped, and it amused Florence, even if it made the clumsy bimbo more anxious. 

Candy walked into the lounge with a coffee. "Sorry it took so long, sir. Candy just had to do the kitchen. Like, it was so messy," she smiled. 

When he gruffly answered, while playing a computer game, Candy felt hurt. She wanted Tommy to take an interest in her, as he had before. She had enjoyed it when he did nice things to her. Perhaps he was annoyed with her for breaking things. 

She began to tidy up the lounge, putting away magazines and stacking up games in a rack. She bent at the waist, just as he had showed her, to pick up a magazine. Looking over her shoulder at him, with a big smile on her face brought disappointment. He was ignoring her, despite showing off her cute bottom. 

Florence was appalled. The stupid girl was showing off her bottom in the short skirt, and the guy still had her panties. The lewd way she was bent over was embarrassing. As a mature woman, with a devastating figure, it was humiliating to be flaunting her body to a young guy. 

'Stop that right now! He's more interested in that game than you!' Florence shouted at Candy. 

Florence realised this was the wrong approach. She needed to encourage the poor thing in the right direction, rather than reproach the silly thing. The heavier she pushed, the more she was ignored. 

Candy wanted to feel young and good about herself. Tommy could make her feel so alive and sexy. It made her feel so good, when he wanted her, and paid her attention. She accidently dropped the magazines and got down on her knees to pick them up. One fell open to a picture of a naked woman, with legs spread wide. 

With a glint in her eyes she crawled over to Tommy, gripping the magazine in her teeth. Dropping the magazine in his lap, she was pleased to gain his attention. 

"Can Tommy teach Candy to do this?" Candy asked. She looked up at him through long eyelashes, opening her eyes as wide as possible, trying to look cute. 

Florence winced from mental pain. She had tried to tell Candy he wasn't interested in her, and that she should get a taxi home. It wasn't working. This was a disgusting result, far worse than she could have imagined. 

When playing the bimbo game with her husband, men had tried it on with her. She had giggled and encouraged them, by being too stupid to realise what they were up to. It had been embarrassing, sometimes humiliating, to be treated like a dumb blonde. It had also been a huge turn on. Without the hypnosis it would have been impossible to behave like that. 

On an adventure, as they called them, a stranger had asked if her breasts were real, or implants. After much encouragement, and a lot of giggling, she let him feel her breasts. He still wouldn't believe her, so the stupid bimbo was preparing to show them to him. As usual her husband came to the rescue just in time, and spirited her away. 

The expression of disappointment on the strangers face had her panting for it. Florence had been so turned on by being treated like a stupid bimbo, and being tricked into nearly showing off her breasts, she was deeply aroused. They had hardly got out of the car park before she began grabbing at her husband's pants. She remembered they pulled into a lonely spot off the road, and fucked like crazy. 

The danger was that the Candy personality was now in control, without her husband to save her. 

Tommy looked at the dirty magazine, which had been hidden among the gaming ones. The centre fold was certainly athletic. The model was a blonde like Candy, only she was unable to prove it, from being shaved bare. He stared at the picture, with a little embarrassment, having always kept them a secret. 

"Please, sir. You teached me good before. Like, Candy could do that, if you showed me how," Candy pleaded. 

It was obvious she didn't like being ignored. In the pool hall she had loved the attention of those guys, despite how rude they were. He tried not to get excited, needing to keep his head and not get carried away. Well, perhaps he could show her. Damn! How could he refuse. 

"To the bathroom, you need to do something first," Tommy firmly stated. 

When she came round out of the hypnotic influence, she would have something to puzzle over. He still assumed she wouldn't remember anything, and was completely oblivious of what was happening. He smiled to himself, with the image of this girl showering, and wondering how it had happened. He wondered if she would scream on finding her pubes had been so completely shaved off, without a recollection of how or when. 

Holding her hand he led her to the family bathroom, where there was room to manoeuvre. He didn't notice how shabby it was, as it hadn't been used or cleaned up since his mother left. There were no towels or anything for her to lay on, so he grabbed what was needed and led her to his bedroom. 

"Pull the skirt up around your waist," he gruffly told her. 

"Ooo! Like, wow, am I going to have another scrummy orgasm?" Candy asked, in an excited voice. 

Florence felt as though she had been shoved into a corner. Candy was so excited, her head was full of giggles and gasps of excitement. It left little room for Florence to think of a defence. 

"Lay back on the bed," he said, and watched her eagerly hitch up the skirt. She was chuckling and yelping with pleasure. She lifted her hips for him to push a pillow under them. She wriggled with exaggerated movements to position herself, lifting her hips up at him. 

The wetness of her pussy glinted under the lights, on the fluffy golden hairs. This was the first time being under good lighting, and it was obvious she was no teenager. He didn't notice, as he was concentrating on her crotch. 

He sprayed foam between her legs. 

"Whoa! That tickles!" Candy laughed. 

Florence cringed from shame over the indignity of what was about to happen. This young guy had her in the palm of his hand, literally. Candy was being worked up, though it was her body, so she too felt the rush of chemicals. Florence was being fired up along with Candy, and there wasn't a damn thing she could do about it. 

While working the foam over her pussy he explored it, feeling it open up, discovering her clit. Her legs spread out with every press of a sensitive button. They flexed and shook. Her head was pushed back, with mouth wide open, gasping air, moaning sounds of encouragement. 

He stopped fingering her, instead he ran the cold razor up a thigh. This too elicited a whimper of pleasure. Pulling on a lip, he carefully ran the blade over it. There wasn't much hair to start with, and soon there wasn't anything at all. She was completely bald, from back to front, her crotch was naked. 

"Push them apart, a little more," he encouraged, with a hand to her ankles. Surely that must hurt, he thought. Her legs were straight out sideways, pulling her pussy lips wide open. 

"Is your Candy like in the picture?" she asked. Her breathing was rapid, leaving her speaking between gasps. 

"Yep," he announced. 

"Can sir, like, give Candy another orgasm, please!" she whined. 

Florence was whining with her. Cowering in a corner of her mind, no longer able to resist the overpowering arousal, she joined in the pathetic pleading. Florence needed this young guy to fuck her. She didn't have to do anything, she just handed over what little control there was to Candy. 

He dropped his jeans, only losing sight of her gaping pussy while pulling off the t-shirt. He crawled onto the bed, between her outstretched thighs. He glanced either side of him, at her wriggling feet. They were uncontrollably twitching and flexing. 

There was no need to hold back, he just guided his cock into her waiting pussy. With legs stretched out sideways she couldn't move. He felt her vagina grip him tight. He slowly moved in a rocking motion, back and forth. His breathing rasped as he got closer to an orgasm. He yelled something, meaning he was about to cum. He didn't hear her similar announcement. 

"Push it in, shove your cock into Candy. Do me, real hard and deep, please, sir," she yelped. The girly voice now had a harsh, deeper tone. 

He felt as though it was going on forever, and wanted it to last, though suddenly he cum. He pumped sperm deep inside her, feeling the twitches of his cock and her inner spasms. 

They fell apart and Tommy fell into an instant sleep. 

Candy snuggled up to him, feeling satisfied from an orgasm and having a boyfriend to look after her. The inner voice told her she needed someone to look after her, and she focused the idea on Tommy. The confusing proposal of getting a taxi, and the feeling of belonging to him was resolved, she would stay there, and do as she was told like a good girl. 

Florence shrank deeper into the recesses of her mind. Letting this young guy fuck her was so very bad. The physical arousal had overwhelmed her, flooding her mind with desire, so there had been no chance of fighting it. She had chosen to invoke the bimbo personality, so couldn't blame anyone else for what happened. 

*** 

Next morning Florence became aware of the morning light slanting into her eyes. She couldn't see anything, for moment. Flickering them rapidly to focus, she became aware of the young man's back. 

Hell! This was the most embarrassing situation of her life. She would have to face this young man, pretending to be Candy, until escaping the horrendous situation. She was trapped between him and the bedroom wall, so couldn't sneak off without waking him. She just hoped he wouldn't insist on taking her home. 

Putting off the moment of truth, she lay there waiting for him to wake. Peering over his snoring head, she looked around for her panties. Where had he put them? She was a mature, married woman, behaving like a stupid little slut, and would have to carry out the ruse for a while longer. 

At last he stirred, yawned, and turned over. 

"Hi Tommy," Candy gushed, and lavished his face with kisses. 

Florence cringed inside. The damn hypnosis was still active! The bimbo personality had been in place for so long yesterday, it was continuing to hold her. It should have been broken while she slept. 

'No! Pease let me go! Please Candy take me home. Don't let this young guy fuck me again, please!' Florence begged. 

She fell deeper into a dark place, as though down a deep well. Having to suffer a whole weekend of humiliation that Candy would bring upon her, was too horrendous to face. She didn't want to experience it and the only way was to shut herself off from Candy, letting the bimbo get on with it. 

In her imagination, her murmurings echoed. 'Please don't disgrace me. Please don't let him fuck you Candy. It's my body he will be using. Hell! Don't let him find out who I am,' Florence whimpered in her hideaway.

Chapter 03 

Sent Home 

Florence gave up trying to fight off the silly bimbo personality. Having been hypnotised all week the influence ran too deep. She was stuck with an air-head girl making all the decisions for her. The person she was hypnotised to be, was called Candy. 

Playing at being a stupid bimbo for an hour or two with her husband was fun, but a whole week of it was dreadful. What made it so bad, was that Candy had a crush on Tommy, a young eighteen year old. As a mature married woman she was passed all that nonsense. She had responsibilities and a position in the community, yet she was behaving like a love sick puppy. 

Tommy was looking after her in his father's house, while he was away on business. Candy was so wrapped up in pleasing Tommy, she was willing to do anything for him. Unfortunately it didn't mean just tidying up the house, it meant sleeping with him. 

She was painfully aware of what was happening, and helpless to prevent it. Her mind was being used by Candy, and her body was being used by Tommy. He easily outwitted the stupid bimbo, and was teaching her lewd tricks. 

Candy lay back on the floor, completely naked. She had lost her clothes while playing strip poker. 

"Do I have too?" Candy complained. She screwed up her eyebrows and pouted her lips at him. 

"You lost the hand, and don't have any clothes left. You have to pay a forfeit instead. Rules of the game," Tommy explained yet again. 

"I'd rather have you!" she sweetly smiled at him. 

"No, that wouldn't be a forfeit, would it," he pointed out. 

Before she could ask again what a forfeit meant, he indicated she should get on with it. He watched her pick up the vibrator and rub it between her lips. She didn't show much enthusiasm. 

He leaned forward, steadied her hand, and switched it on. 

"Oooo! That tickles," she giggled. 

A little more enthusiasm was shown as her lips parted. They were becoming slick with juices as she tickled her clit. 

"Try to imagine it's me you have in your hand," Tommy encouraged. 

"Eh?" Candy mumbled. 

She closed her eyes, to concentrate on the sensations. She had no compunction in following Tommy's instructions, it was just that she found things so difficult to understand. He had made her his by taking her; making love to her. So now she had to do whatever he said, and she really wanted to please him. After all, she didn't want to be dumped, as that would be a disaster. 

Florence felt waves of arousal overcoming her. It wasn't just Candy who felt the sensations. It was her body heating up, and that worked on her too. As humiliating as it was, the climax couldn't be resisted. She and her alter ego, Candy were close. 

Candy threw her head back and wailed. Her whole body rocked. The dildo was worked hard up inside her, then back out over her clit. It fell from her hand, as the orgasm reached out to her limbs, leaving them weak. 

Tommy watched her intently. He had never seen a girl masturbate before, so found it amazing. Her orgasm with him was impressive, as she would lose control, seemingly taken over by it. This too was worth watching. After awhile her eyes flickered open and she gave him a big smile. 

"Oh Tommy! Like that was wonderful. You know how to please you're little Candy," she demurely said, with an expression of delight. 

The phone rang a few times before he heard it. He rocked forward in the chair, almost dropping the phone. His father was giving him a warning that he would be back in an hour or two. 

He looked around the place, only then noticing that everything was tidy for a change. Candy might be a stupid bimbo, but Florence was an experienced housewife. He hadn't noticed her cleaning the place. He would have to explain why it looked so good later, though right now he had to get rid of the reason. 

"Get dressed, Candy," he firmly said. Fortunately she was satisfied and didn't argue. When he ushered her out to a cab, she seemed unusually confused. 

Florence was jubilant. At last she was being sent home. She repeated the address to Candy again and again. She told Candy this was a good idea, and that she needed to get home. Candy didn't want to leave Tommy, but he was firm and had her in the cab before she knew what was happening. 

Candy was shocked from being sent away by her boyfriend. In this state it gave Florence a chance to work on her. Once home she might regain some control. She just hoped her husband was there to break the damned hypnotic suggestion. 

'Yes!' Florence silently yelled once the door was closed behind her. 

Candy was in a sullen mood, almost going along with suggestions from Florence. In the bedroom Florence wanted to change out of the ridiculous clothes, but Candy just sat and moped. After all, the stupid one was a teenager. 

*** 

Mathew came home from a week at a resort. He wondered why Florence hadn't turned up, and tried phoning home several times. At the point of returning home he reasoned that the vacation had been paid for, so why not enjoy it. He didn't want to face the repacking either. 

Sitting at the bar looking concerned, a smiling face asked if he was alright. He found a distraction, a beautiful blonde distraction. During the day they walked in the park, chatted in the gym, and floated around in the pool. They flirted while drinking at the bar in the evenings. The third day found them drinking too much, ending with a steamy night in her cabin. 

Catherine was lively and intelligent, and great fun to be with. Now he had to return home to face an unpleasant scene. On the drive home he felt so guilty, he forgot about why Florence hadn't joined him at the resort. 

"Florence! You here?" he shouted, while heaving luggage through the door. He unpacked his clothes, dumping them in the utility room. Her case he took to their room. 

"What's wrong? I've been worried about you!" he complained. Seeing her just sitting there ignoring him was a clue. 

"Have you been here like this?" Matthew asked. He was worried that she might have been just sitting there all week. He looked her over, to realise it was a stupid notion. 

Florence wanted to shout with happiness, now her husband was home and freedom was so close. She knew not to yell at the stupid girl, as she would just be ignored. Florence felt the tide of emotion pushing Candy into action. 

"Oh! Wow! You're home!" Candy exclaimed, in a high pitched girly voice. She was a little confused about who this man was. For some reason she felt very happy he was home. 

The reaction confirmed it. She had put herself under the influence of the bimbo personality. It couldn't have been all week, for that would be too much for anyone to withstand. She must have triggered it in anticipation of his homecoming. 

He didn't want to ask what she had been up to, in case she asked him in return. If he left her like this he would have time to get over Catherine, and not reveal what happened. 

Catherine was a beautiful sophisticated woman, closer to his age, and so they shared things in common. His wife was a few years younger yet right then she was acting like an air-head teen. The games had been fun, and the uninhibited sex was great. Though he wondered if marrying a younger woman had been the right thing to do. 

"Err, this is your house, sir? OK. Does that mean I have to do as I'm told?" Candy sweetly asked. 

He wondered what she was playing at now. 

Florence had at least got something through to the stupid one. She had been urging Candy to behave herself, and to do as the man told her. The part about asking him to remove the hypnosis, didn't get through the girls confused thinking. She probably wouldn't be able to pronounce the word, 'hypnosis', anyway. 

"Yes. While in my home you must do as I say," Matthew stated. 

He decided to play along, until it was clear what she wanted to do. What he didn't want was to make love. He had a lot to think about. Mostly about a fun blonde, who made him feel good. 

It was just possible to influence Candy, if she wasn't distracted by someone else. She didn't think it a good idea to say he was her husband. The girl was confused enough as it was. 

Florence was becoming confused too. Why hadn't he used the phrase to bring her round? She was grounded! Sent to her room, or rather the spare room, she wondered why. From the sounds in the utility room and kitchen, he was obviously washing clothes and cooking. 

She wished she could tell him it had been a whole week under the influence of the hypnosis. He would understand the danger she was in, and bring her round straight away. Having endured a whole week as Candy she would need some time to recover. 

Anyway, at least she didn't have to explain away the past week with Tommy. That would be so painful, she would have to keep it a dark secret. 

They ate together, while her husband treated her like a stupid adolescent. It was frustrating watching the two of them interacting without being able to speak her mind. Candy babbled stupidly as expected, but at least she didn't blurt out anything about Tommy. 

Florence figured he was punishing her for missing the week of vacation time together. After doing those bad things with Tommy, she deserved what-ever he put her through. Sent to her room after dinner suited her too. She felt too dirty to sleep in the same bed as her husband. 

Next morning Matthew expected to face Florence and a thorough questioning. He set the answers straight in his mind. Walking, exercising, a couple of drinks, and an early night. A pleasant week, but he had missed her. 

When she walked into the kitchen as Candy, he was both relieved and puzzled. Surely the hypnosis should have cleared after a full night of sleep. Quietly fixing breakfast he shut out the inane adolescent chatter. 

The doorbell rang. "Look after the toast, Candy," he said. Knowing how incapable the bimbo was, he switched off the toaster, rather than face a disaster. 

"Glad your back!" Bernard greeted Matthew, as he barged in. "You're not going to be though. A potential customer wants a presentation Monday morning. I need your help, Mat," he explained. 

The smells of breakfast wafted from the kitchen, interesting his boss. "I was just making some toast, want some," Matthew offered. He meant to bring it in to the lounge, but Bernard followed him, with his son trailing them. 

"This is, err, Candy, my niece," Matthew lied. 

He wasn't used to thinking on his feet, from the habit of planning everything in detail. It seemed to work though. Introducing his wife as a niece was embarrassing. What else could he do while she was still hypnotised, and behaving like a young girl. The way she was made up and dressed, they got away with it. 

"This is Damien," Bernard offhandedly said. He almost added, Damien by name and by nature. Knowing the boy would recount it to his mother, kept him quiet. 

They went into the study with the coffee and toast. Bernard was eager to make a start. Matthew was relieved to immerse himself in work. They brainstormed over content style and figures. 

Taking a break, Matthew made coffee. 

"Where's he got to. I hope he's not causing trouble," Bernard crossly stated. 

"I'm sure they'll be alright. pour the coffee and I'll check up on them," Matthew helpfully said. All he wanted to do was forget about her for awhile. Work had always been absorbing, and he needed to forget about personal conflicts. 

Mathew strode toward the spare room where his wife had been grounded. Hearing giggling rising from the basement he turned toward the stairs. The door was ajar, so he peeked through. He wanted to avoid Florence, while she was Candy. He was worried the conversation between them might reveal who she really was. 

From the top of the stairs he nearly fell. The damn kid was messing with his wife! They were kissing, and he had his arms wrapped around her! 

He froze, only just holding back a shout of indignation. He wondered what to say. Of course he could put a stop to it. She was his wife for god's sake! He began to think it through. He was responsible for his niece, so he could intervene. 

Damn! Why was she letting that kid smooch her? He was only eighteen. She was a married woman, even though hypnotised to be Candy the silly bimbo. 

"Everything OK?" Bernard shouted from the study. 

Now that could be a problem. Bernard didn't look at her in the kitchen. If he made a fuss, Bernard might find out the so called niece was his wife. How in hell could he explain why she was kissing the boss's son? 

He watched her push him away. He was a lousy kisser; all wet and sloppy. If she didn't know he had seen them, she couldn't blame him for it when released. She could control the situation to some extent, so he decided to leave her to it. 

"They're OK. Playing some computer game," Matthew told the boss. 

*** 

Florence was appalled. Candy had been flashing her eyes at this kid. He was running his eyes over her from the moment he stepped into the kitchen. The skirt and top were better than she had worn all week, but they were still embarrassingly childish. 

Sent off to play, as his father had quipped, was demeaning. She guided him to the basement, rather than go to her room where there was a bed, and temptation. It wasn't so much him, as Candy who had to be watched. 

They sat on the sofa ready to play a game. Candy pressed up against him, leading him on. Florence tried to remind her Tommy was her boyfriend. 

"Tommy was my boyfriend, but we broke up," Candy said, out of context as usual. She had got the message, only to misread it. 

"I don't have a girlfriend either. We broke up just before the summer break," Damien said. 

Florence could see what was happening, but couldn't do anything about it. Before she could gather her wits to even try and intervene, Candy was opening her mouth to him. The wet kiss was awful. 

"You don't kiss like that! Let me show you," Candy offered. The boy looked aggrieved from being criticised, but brightened over the offer. Candy showed him how to kiss, by twinning her tongue with his. 

The petting was innocent enough between teenagers, but she was a married woman, not a silly young girl. 

*** 

The two men worked away until they were stuck over which way to push the client. 

"He's too quiet for my liking," Bernard grumbled. 

"You make the coffee and I'll check up on them," Matthew said, trying to sound reassuring. 

The door was still carelessly left open. Looking in, he silently cursed. He thought everything had settled down, since she had pushed Damien away. He was surprised to see they were again kissing like teenagers. They were devouring each other. He was about to march in when he saw Florence part her legs. 

A movement in the skirt froze him at the door. "No!" He whispered. The damn kid was fingering his wife! Fortunately they were so carried away, his presence wasn't noticed. 

Candy whispered instructions in Damien's ear. She had learnt a lot while staying with Tommy, and was using that experience to guide Damien. Though it was nice, he wasn't getting it right. 

Florence silently groaned in frustration, after trying hard to stop the stupid girl. At least her body wasn't being excited enough for her to succumb. She had a chance to thwart the pair of them, if only she could get through to the stupid bimbo. 

Matthew was angry with his wife for letting it happen. Too ashamed to confront them, he decided to let her get on with it. If she too had something to be guilty about, it would let him off the hook. 

Florence realised It was a mistake to remind Candy about Tommy being her boyfriend. Candy felt rejected by him since being sent away in a taxi. She was playing up to this boy all the more. The stupid bitch was teaching him what to do. She was telling him where to touch her! 

*** 

A list of probable questions the client might have was completed, so they broke for lunch. Matthew made sandwiches while Bernard made the coffee. 

"It's OK! I'll see what they want," Matthew hurriedly interrupted his boss. 

"Thanks! I've been lumbered with him while Maurine is visiting her mother. Whatever I say to him, he does the opposite. You'll find out what they're like when you have kids. They behave themselves with others, but parents get the hell treatment," he angrily stated. 

Matthew peeked down the stairs with a feeling of foreboding engulfing him. This time he was determined to do something. He at least could make them break for lunch. An excuse would be needed to send her to the spare room, without involving Bernard. 

His eyes gaped in shock. Florence was on her knees, with her head bobbing up and down in the kids lap. Hell! The guy had his eyes screwed shut, while his wife was blowing him! 

He backed away, unable to cope with the sordid image. He walked in a trance to the bathroom. Splashing his face with cold water didn't help. He returned to the kitchen looking dazed. 

*** 

Florence was appalled over what Candy had her doing. The stupid slut was using a new found skill, honed over the past week with Tommy. She was swallowing the kids cock, right down to his balls! 

It was so much more nasty when she hadn't been sexed up ready for it. The feeling of his cock in her mouth was dreadful. The smell and taste of it was acrid. Feeling him tense meant the inevitable was about to happen. Florence just hoped Candy didn't swallow. 

Shit! Candy was making a show of swallowing his cum! The lad was ecstatic, with a big grin over his face. Maybe now they would settle down to actually playing a game. 

*** 

"Everything OK?" Bernard asked. 

"Sure," Matthew weakly replied. 

"You're deep in thought. I know you'll solve the presentation issues. Wish I could have given you more information," Bernard warmly said. 

He looked distracted, of course he did. His wife was blowing the bosses son! The humiliation of having the boss discover them turned the anger toward Florence. Instead of putting a stop to the despicable behaviour, he just nodded at the boss. She could bloody well save herself this time! 

"What do they want to eat?" Bernard asked. 

"They're fine! They're playing a game. Best not disturb them," Mathew said. 

"That's kids for you! Never want to eat at meal times, then expect a pizza to miraculously appear before them. Well at least he's keeping out of trouble. You sure they're OK? Maybe I should warn him to behave himself," Bernard huffed. 

"No! While they're busy, err, playing a computer game, its best leaving them to it," Mathew encouraged. 

"Let's eat, and we can get the job done," Bernard said. "They must have won the game, from the noise they're making," Bernard commented, between bites. 

While they ate the boss's son was making out with his wife. He couldn't unravel his thinking enough to work out what to do. Why was she letting that young kid do that to her? He heard the familiar sound of his wife's orgasmic wail. It was too late to do anything now. 

Bernard raised his eyebrows, acknowledging the excited voices. "We didn't have computer games when I was a kid. I don't know why they get so excited over the damn things," he mused. 

Matthew shrugged his shoulders. He felt beaten. He could at least escape the ordeal by absorbing himself in work. They were silent now, so maybe it was all over. If she gave him grief over leaving her at home all week, he would use this against her. It was a poor consolation. 

"All finished!" Bernard grinned. He stretched his arms above his head to relieve the tension. "I'll just use the bathroom and get out of your way," he added. 

Matthew saved the documents, and made a backup for Bernard. He sat back rubbing his face, wondering what to do about Florence. The hypnotic influence was obviously far stronger than he thought. They would have to leave off playing their games, which suited him. One consolation was that she was bound to agree after this.  

===

He sat up straight, listening intently. Hearing Bernard's voice meant he was talking to his son. He just hoped Florence had gone back to the spare room. Hearing harsh words had him leaping out of the chair, hurrying to the basement. 

"I'm not leaving you here, that's final!" Bernard exploded. 

"Can Candy come home with us then?" Damien asked. 

"We can finish this game. I promise to keep out of your way. I'll fix food and tidy my room, whatever you want," Damien promised. 

Bernard was taken aback. His son had lost the sullen adolescent tone of voice to actually sound pleasant. 

"It's not up to me," Bernard said, sounding more conciliatory. 

Matthew heard the conversation, not liking it one bit. 

"That would be great. I've never been able to play this game. I'd love to finish it," Candy gushed. 

Matthew looked at the two of them. They looked like innocent adolescents, with no sign of the earlier disgusting behaviour. It was a relief that his boss hadn't recognised his wife, and wouldn't discover what the two of them had been up to. 

Candy stepped close to Bernard and looked up into his face. The innocent feminine charm won him over. He looked at the two of them, showing eagerness to please. Candy was obviously having a good effect on Damien. 

"If your uncle agrees, that's OK with me," he conceded. He looked guiltily toward Matthew, realising he had put him on the spot. 

Matthew groped for a reasonable reason not to let her leave. "Maybe. I'm not sure," he weakly prevaricated, playing for a second to get his thoughts into gear. 

The phone rang, distracting the conversation before it could get out of hand. Matthew looked at the calling number and hesitated answering it. 

"I won't be a moment," he said, and climbed the stairs. At least this would give him a minute or two to clear his head. 

"It's you, didn't think you would call. No! That's great. Yea, I had a wonderful time too. This evening? Well, no, its work. I'd love to, but, hell why not. I'd like that. We did, we got on well," Matthew replied. 

He had been transported back to the time spent with Catherine. Again all his cares in world vanished, from just hearing her voice. Ending the call he was torn between the two of them. If he got Florence out of the way it would leave his evening free. 

It would serve her right to be trapped as a stupid eighteen year old for a while longer. After a pleasant dinner with Catherine he could pick Florence up and bring her round. The two of them couldn't get away with much with Bernard keeping an eye on them. 

Back in the basement the three of them were chatting amiably. The scene was a far cry from earlier. Bernard was actually smiling at his son. Maybe it would work out for them all. 

"OK! I agree. Hold on. You have to promise to behave yourself and do as your told," Matthew firmly told his wife 

"It might work out well, Mat. You will be free to make the presentation. They can entertain each other, keeping Damien out of my hair. You promise to do the chores and keep out of the way?" Bernard asked. 

"Sure, anything," Damien grinned. "Thanks dad, I'll be on my best behaviour, promise," the boy sincerely added. 

Damien shoved a case into the car and jumped in beside Candy. 

Matthew watched them climb into the Mercedes with increasing doubts. His judgement had impaired by the thought of seeing Catherine again. It was a bad decision. The flash of thigh as his wife got into the back seat confirmed it. 

It was too late. They sped off with Bernard driving too fast as usual. "Damn!" Matthew exclaimed. He had sent his wife off with a randy eighteen year old boy, while she was behaving like an irresponsible hussy. 

He felt the phone in his pocket, at last thinking of an excuse. He would drive over there right now, and say the aunt had phoned. Candy had to go home, as her mother was back from the hospital. 

The phone vibrated with an incoming call. "Yes!" he sharply answered. "Oh! Hi! Sure, dinner, sounds great. Here? Well, I don't think there's anything in. I've been on vacation for a week. Yes I enjoyed it, with fabulous company," he laughed. 

"Oh, just a beautiful woman who makes me laugh and is fun to be with," he laughed again. "Chinese will be good. I'll set the table ready for you." She quipped that the kitchen table wouldn't be comfortable. "You're naughty, but nice!" he replied, with a sigh. 

He was standing looking at an empty street. Catherine was on her way, so maybe he wouldn't go over there straight away. 

*** 

Florence was numb with astonishment. Her husband had let her go while still hypnotised. Of course he didn't realise how helpless she was, as he didn't know she had been like this for a whole week. Even so, why had he let her go? It was no excuse, being pushed into it by Bernard. 

If he knew what had happened in the basement he wouldn't have let her go. The man was too easily swayed. He had only been made CEO for research because of the work he put in, not because he was ambitious. He was a walkover, hence the boss turning up unannounced at a weekend. 

Damn! Him! He had better save her, and quickly. She wanted to turn around to glare at her husband, only Candy was busy giggling with Damien. The car sped away. She was trapped with this boy who saw her as a box of delights. She dreaded arriving at their house and having to put up with Damien pawing her.  

===

The car stereo played a tune that caught Florence's attention - 'Why must I be a teenager in love?'. It was an old song bringing back memories. The plaintive tone moved her emotions down a notch, to where she felt sorry for herself. Why, oh, why was she forced to endure being a teenager for a second time. Had she offended Aphrodite? 

Under hypnosis she was taking on the role of a stupid adolescent girl, which was frustrating for a mature, married woman. As Candy she was playing up to Damien, in a gauche and obvious way. She wanted him to be her boyfriend, and would do anything to capture his attention. 

He was eighteen and thought she was too. Telling him she had been chucked by a boyfriend made her available. As a stupid bimbo she was both vulnerable, and only too available. He had already taken advantage of the stupid girl she was forced to be while hypnotised. 

At least while his father drove them home the boy was behaving himself. That was another worrying point. Why had her husband been so stupid as to let her be carted off while still hypnotised. She was more than annoyed with him, she was furious. 

They arrived home after a frenetic drive, as though the businessman really believed time was money. Damien carried a suitcase from the car, looking pleased to help. It was the one packed for a week away at the vacation complex with her husband. 

"Typical of a woman to pack a month's clothes for one night away," Bernard muttered. He wondered if he had drawn the short straw, by taking her on. Instead of one adolescent to supervise, he now had two. 

"Do you want Pizza, dad?" Damien asked. 

Bernard was about to refuse then thought the rare offer shouldn't be discouraged. He had better help, or the kid might destroy the kitchen. 

"Go on, I know you want to get to work. We'll fix it and bring you a slice," Damien helpfully said. 

"Sure, sir. Like, I'll help Damien," Candy said, with the usual bouncy glee. 

Unsure if either of them could follow simple instructions on a packet, he reluctantly left them to it. The famous words, 'what could go wrong', haunted him as he copied a report onto his computer. The moment he started reading it, he became absorbed. 

"Here sir, like, your pizza, sir," Candy smiled at him. 

"Thank you, young lady. It looks good!" he said, with surprise. It wasn't burnt and smelled good. She laid a napkin across his knee, and handed him a knife and fork. 

"Damien said, like, err, not to get your keyboard messy," she giggled. 

Bernard laughed along with her. She was certainly having a good affect on the boy. He hadn't realised how thoughtful Damien could be, and it was down to him trying to impress this girl. 

Bernard patted her on the head, with a big smile on his face. "Thank you sweetie, you're a treasure. Go along now and play with Damien. Please keep the noise down while I'm working," he added. 

"Would you like anything else, sir?" she sweetly asked. 

"This is fine. Just be a good girl, and do as you're told while here. Go on, I'm sure Damien has a game lined up for you," he encouraged. 

Florence was sure that was right, though it wasn't a computer game the boy had in mind. Florence was surprised to be led to the guest room, rather than his bedroom. He seemed eager to please, and offered to unpack the case. 

It seemed the nasty sex session in the basement had satisfied him. Despite the despicable act she had performed, he was prepared to treat her with respect. Candy pulled out a dress and cooed with delight. 

"I've just got to try this on, like, it's so fab!" she trilled. 

Before Damien could leave, she lifted the dress she was wearing over her head. 

As it happened Florence tried to warn the stupid girl. 'Don't strip off in front of him, you'll lose all respect! You want him to be your boyfriend don't you?' 

Candy pulled the dress close, trying to cover herself. Florence sighed with relief. At last she was learning how to motivate Candy. 

"Oh! Silly me. Like, are you my boyfriend now?" Candy asked, while clutching the dress, looking demure. 

"Sure, of course!" Damien earnestly answered. 

"Oh! Like, really totally fab! Candy is so happy!" she chirruped, like a chipmunk on speed. She dropped the dress and grabbed the pink one off the bed. 

"Should I let you change," Damien asked, reluctantly turning to go. 

"Oh! Sorry. I'm supposed to do as I'm told," Candy pouted, misunderstanding him. "May Candy try on this gorgeous dress? Please! Pretty please!" she whined, in what was supposed to be a winning pose. 

Damien was pleased, for she was wearing just a pair of panties and bra. Florence could see he was caught between doing the right thing by leaving, yet drawn to her like a guy to an electronic device. 

"Do you want me to leave?" he asked, looking confused. He thought she was being sarcastic, meaning he should leave her to change. 

"No, silly. You're my boyfriend, and Candy must do as she is told. Please! Let me try on the pretty dress," she moaned. 

"So, as your boyfriend, you have to do everything I tell you?" he asked, looking hopeful. 

"Of course! My uncle and your father told me to do as I'm told, so I must. You're my boyfriend, so I have to do as you tell me. Candy promises to be a good girl and do everything she is told, honest," Candy earnestly said. 

"OK! You can try on the dress," he firmly stated. 

He hadn't much experience with girls, yet it was obvious there was something different about her. It wasn't just the eager to please attitude, or the dumb way she spoke. Then again he hadn't ever received a blowjob either, so why bother to figure her out. 

He looked her over as she struggled into the dress. She was a cute little thing, with a slim figure. In fact she was gorgeous. 

She was stupid and gullible. He decided he could put up with that, for what she had to offer. He had never liked air-heads, but she was different. Candy didn't have pretentions, and didn't try to put him through hoops on the chance of receiving something that would never happen. Fuck! It already had happened, in her uncle's basement. 

"It's no good. This underwear shows through. Yuk!" Candy stated, and stamped her foot in frustration. 

"Is there any underwear in here?" Damien asked, wanting to keep her in a good mood. 

"Oh! Yea, like, there must be!" she tragically spoke. 

Florence silently groaned. The damn case was packed for a week of naughty games. Wearing such demeaning clothes, would mean looking as well as acting like a stupid bimbo. While away the hypnotic influence would have been used for just an hour or two a day with her husband, not for a whole night with this boy. 

Letting Candy loose on these clothes was going to keep her preoccupied forever, and hopefully keep her out of trouble. Florence shut out the inevitable inane chatter over fashion and make-up. Retreating to a corner of her mind, leaving Candy to it, was the only possible escape. 

Rummaging through the case, she pulled out a pink set of underwear. "Wow! Just what I need. Like, these are so cool! They go so well with the dress," she enthused. 

Damian watched her pull the dress up, where she became entangled. "Oh! Help, I'm stuck," she complained. 

Damien untangled a bright sparkly bracelet from the hem of the dress, while fondling her body. She didn't seem to mind, as long as she could get to try on the dress. 

Once free she pulled the panties off and turned around for him to unclip the bra. 

Everything seemed bright in the room as his eyes opened wide to take in the slow moving naked body. He didn't want to get close. Instead he wanted to stand back to marvel at her cute ass. She had something worth looking at and admiring. 

"Please! Get me out of this horrible bra," she complained. 

Who was he to argue. He pulled at the stretchy material, trying to figure it out. The tiny clips seemed impossible to undo. When it parted, he wrapped his hands around her breasts. He cupped them and weighed them. He suddenly realised what he was doing, and that she wasn't complaining. 

He pinched her nipples, hearing her coo with pleasure. He rubbed her bare bottom with the jeans, where his cock bulged. It was delightful yet frustrating. He wanted to press his luck. He knew girls wanted to look good, and she had set her mind to trying on the dress. 

"Do you have to do everything I say?" he purred in her ear. 

"Yes, sir," she softly answered. 

"Then I want you to kiss me," he managed to say, in a voice sounding thick with passion. 

"Can Candy try on the dress afterwards?" she demurely asked. 

"Yes, anything my wonderful Candy wants," he heavily breathed. 

"Ooo, goody. Candy just loves pretty dresses!" she buzzed. 

He was past being surprised by such banal statements. He could only think of one thing, her lips around his cock. She turned in his arms to kiss him for a full on, no holds barred snog. She devoured him as he enveloped her in his arms. Hands went to her bottom to press her naked body against his aching bulge. 

Florence cringed with taught nerves. She was in her husband's, bosses home, with the son mauling her naked body. If Bernard caught her with his son, she would die of shame. What would her husband say on arriving home, sent back for misbehaving like a dirty little slut with his son. Bernard wasn't known for his subtlety. 

"Anyone home?" Mable shouted. 

"Shit!" Damian whispered. He disentangled himself from Florence, having to hold her away. "Get dressed, it's my mom! Quickly!" he urged her. 

"Oooo! I can wear that lovely dress. Where are you going, don't you want to see my dress?" Florence pouted. 

"Sure Candy. I want it to be a surprise," Damian whispered back. 

"Goody! Candy likes surprises," she said, as he retreated from the room. 

She stood there looking confused for a moment, wondering what the surprise was going to be. 

Florence sighed with relief. With his mother home the boy wouldn't be bothering her. She didn't have to encourage the stupid girl, as she eagerly pulled on the underwear and dress. 

Candy twirled the pink party dress in front of a mirror. 

Florence felt how pleased Candy was with the outfit. It showed off a pair of pink panties when it rode up, but at least her bust was decently covered. She no longer looked like a cheap slut which was some relief. She wondered why on earth such a ludicrous outfit had been packed for the week away. It left her feeling pathetic, while looking like a young girl on her way to a girly party. 

Damian peered around the door. "Mom wants to meet you," he hurriedly spoke. 

"Isn't it just adorable? Do I look like Barbie?" Florence asked him. 

"Yea, you look great," he was forced to say. He thought she looked ridiculous. He shrugged his shoulders, as everything was beyond his control now mother was home. 

"Hi ma'am, how are you today?" Candy said, in the high pitched squeaky voice that Florence had become used to. 

"Well! So you're Candy. Damian has been singing your praises dear. He's been struck by you," Mable smiled. 

"Mom!" Damian complained. He was on alert, waiting for Candy to say something stupid. If she mentioned what they had been up to he would be in big trouble. 

Florence was swinging her hips from side to side, with a thumb in her mouth. Even though she was much shorter than Damian, had a light bone structure, a smooth porcelain skin, and wore pig tails, she looked too old for a pink party dress. 

"I like Damian lots. He's teaching me some games," Candy chirruped gaily. "I like your flowery dress, ma'am," Florence commented. 

"Thank you Candy. It makes a change to meet a polite young lady. That's a nice dress too. I take it you like Barbie dolls," Mable said. 

"Oh! Yes! I just love pink. The flowers on your dress look fab!" Florence enthused. 

Mable wore a flouncy dress though more suited to her age. Bernard had married a younger woman, not much older than Florence. Unlike Florence she wasn't such a bright spark, which suited him, for she was happy to keep-house. 

Mable was a little disconcerted when Candy walked in to the lounge. The girl was obviously a dim witted little thing, and Mable was of course protective of her son. She was aware of girls dressing up as film and comic book characters, so assumed this was what they called Cosplay. 

The pure innocence of the girl won her around. "Come and sit here by me," Mable said, while patting the sofa. "It's nice to have a girl around, instead of these men," she smiled. "You like dressing up then," she said. 

"Like really, yea, ma'am. I just love nice dresses, jewellery, and make-up, just loads," Florence giggled. 

Damian watched the two of them discussing make-up, not taking in the girly talk. He watched in dismay as Candy lifted the dress and petticoats to show off her frilly pink panties. His mother didn't seem to mind at all, even making admiring comments and suggestions about make-up. He had been forgotten altogether. 

"We must go out shopping together tomorrow, if you're still here," Mable enthused. She missed not having a daughter, and readily accepted the incongruity of a supposedly eighteen year old, dressed like a Barbie doll. She fell into treating her like Damian's younger sister. 

"That would be so brill! I need some bling to go with this dress so bad," Florence enthused. "That means glittery jewellery and stuff," Florence explained. 

"What about a new dress when we go shopping? I'd love to dress you up in a Barbie outfit. I think I still have all my old Barbie dolls stored away somewhere," Mable mused. 

"Oooo! Lovely. You should show them off. I'd love to see them," Florence enthused. 

Bernard walked in to find the two women amiably chatting. He scowled at the way Candy was dressed. He asked how his mother-in-law was, only they ignored him. Damian went with him back to the study. 

"They seem to be getting on," Bernard said, with a frown of consternation creasing his brow. 

"I think it's something to do with Beatrice," Damian offered. 

"I didn't know you knew about that," Bernard heavily sighed. "Your mother miscarried when you were around three," he quietly spoke to himself. "I see what you mean. Candy is like a lost daughter," Bernard couldn't continue. It had been a long time ago, but it still hurt. 

"They're getting on well. Planning a shopping trip tomorrow," Damian said. 

"At least its keeping her mind off your grandma. I expect it helps Cindy too. Her mother is in hospital," Bernard added. He didn't make the connection with Matthew's excuse for Candy being at his house. Matthew had made up the illness reason after hearing Mable's mother was ill. 

*** 

Matthew intended to pick up his wife as soon as Catherine left after dinner. After a couple of bottles of wine their flirting became more intense. It changed from innuendo to heavy suggestiveness. They kissed. It turned to a passionate embrace. They rolled off the sofa onto the floor in a ardent clinch. 

She frantically pulled at his trousers, while he lifted her dress. There was no need for foreplay. They began to hump each other like wild animals rutting. The enthusiastic love making left them sweating. They intended to make for the bedroom, while shedding clothes along the way. 

They made it to the bathroom, and started all over again. Catherine couldn't wait, so grabbed his cock to suck it into life. It took awhile, but that didn't matter because he was devouring her pussy with enthusiasm. 

She pushed him flat on the floor to straddle him. More slowly this time, she worked up and down his cock. She enjoyed being in control, working to her own rhythm, and rubbing his hardness against her clit. 

*** 

At first Florence was embarrassed from the way the woman treated her like a little girl. At least it wasn't as bad as being mauled by her son. The woman was over motherly, but it left Florence feeling comforted. It had been a long time since her mother died, so she missed the attention. It felt cheering to share girly ideas together. 

Florence could for once relax, with no need to sway the Candy personality away from danger. Candy was happy to be mothered, and so was Florence. For the first time they were both in tune with each other. They were enjoying Mable's company and were both looking forward to going shopping with her. 

"Come on, I had better fix something to eat for you two," Mable said. She gave Candy a spontaneous hug. "It's so nice to have you here. I wish you could stay forever," Mable sighed. 

She kissed Candy on the cheek, and held her shoulders to look at her. "You're such a pretty little thing, I'd just love to pamper you," Mable whispered, and brushed a tear from her cheek. 

A fleeting thought about returning to her husband intruded, until Candy spoke up. 

"That would be lovely. You're so nice and cuddly," Candy said, with a bright smile lighting her face. She hugged the woman with genuine affection. 

Florence couldn't resist Candy's powerful emotional warmth. She forgot all about Matthew, and why he hadn't fetched her home. She thought of her mother, and was overpowered by waves of emotion. At that moment both Florence and Candy's thoughts were one. 

Damian and Candy had eaten, helped with the dishes, and tidied up the kitchen. They ran off to the basement to play computer games. 

Mable was happy with Candy, and pleased her son had helped in the kitchen without being talked into it. Usually when he deigned to do something, it was a reluctant half-hearted job. 

Bernard walked it to see her sitting at the table daydreaming. "We need to get ready for dinner. Remember, we're going out to that new restaurant," Bernard told his wife. 

"I can't leave Candy here," Mable started to say. 

"She'll be fine. Damian can look after her. He's been on his best behaviour since meeting her," Bernard cajoled his wife. 

"If you're sure," she reluctantly agreed. 

On the drive to the restaurant Mable was unusually quiet, until she smiled at Bernard. "She is a good influence on Damian. Wouldn't it be nice if she could stay for a few days," Mable said, looking meaningfully at her husband. 

"Go on, you could persuade Matthew, use your influence. You're a marvellous salesman. Please dear," Mable encouraged, with a bright expectant smile. 

*** 

Damian couldn't wait for his parents to go. He was bouncing with impatience. As soon as he heard the squeal of the car burning rubber, he turned to Candy. "Do you remember what dad said before he left?" he said, with a face strained with hope. 

"Not sure? Remind me," Candy said. 

Here we go again thought Florence. She had been happily thinking of old times while they played a computer game. Giving in to the inevitable she let Candy get on with it. 

"Dad said you should behave yourself and do as you are told. Mother said the same. So, are you going to do as I say?" he asked. 

Candy caught most of what he said, though her mind was wandering. "Sure, of course, Candy will be good, and do as she's told," Candy mindlessly repeated. 

"We could go to your room and try on some more clothes," he suggested. 

"Wow! A fab idea, Candy loves it! Come on, race you!" she squealed in delight. 

Florence was too emotionally drained to even try and contain Candy. Besides, there was little she could do after a week under the hypnotic influence. The two of them rummaged around in the suitcase and Candy was enthralled with each garment pulled from it. 

"I just don't know which to try on first!" she excitedly exclaimed. 

"Just get undressed and I'll decide," Damian told her. 

"Oh lush! It will be like, a surprise," Candy agreed. 

Damian watched her pull of the dress and pull off the panties. While she struggled with the bra he took a good look between her legs. She was perfectly smooth down there. He hadn't noticed when rummaging around earlier, under her instructions. Now it worried him. Sometimes she looked older than him, though she acted young and silly.  

===

"You are over eighteen aren't you?" he asked. 

"Of course silly," Candy replied, as she managed to unhook the bra. 

Florence could have told him she was over thirty. All her family had young looking smooth skin, though it didn't save her parents from passing away so young. Cars should have a health warning - 'head on collisions can seriously damage your health'. 

"I have to shave so I can wear little panties like these," she explained, while holding up a see-through thong. 

"I'd better take a closer look," he grinned. 

Candy bent over the bed with legs spread. He was surprised how easily she gave in to his every suggestion. Surely she wasn't that stupid. 

"Oooo! That feels scrummy!" she purred. 

Florence was preoccupied over thinking about Mabel as a mother figure. It had been so comforting being cared for. She felt the boys hand cupping her sex, and inwardly gasped, just as Candy did. 

He stroked between her lips watching them become slick and open. She was easily aroused. Perhaps that was why she so readily agreed to let him play with her. His friends called a girl at school a slut, but she was nothing like Candy. The girl was a stuck up bitch, as far as he could tell. Whereas Candy had a sweet, trusting nature. 

Thoughts of friends and everything else faded as he became enthralled with what was happening. Would she let him do it to her? She said he was her boyfriend and would do whatever he said. How could he ask her to do it? 

He got up off his knees and undid his jeans, letting them fall to the floor. Pulling his cock from his underwear he rubbed it between her lips. They were now almost dripping. And there was a small hard lump sticking out. Every time he nudged it, she whimpered. 

"You can put it in me, if you want," Candy demurely said. 

Florence agreed with her. The boy had been teasing her for ages. He was probably working up the courage to take her. Surely at eighteen he wasn't still a virgin. At that age she had been studying hard to win a scholarship, with no time for boys. Even at nineteen she hadn't much experience. She had been a virgin when she met Matthew. 

With that thought she realised how wrong this was. She was a mature married woman, letting an eighteen year old use her body. Bent over in such a lewd position made it so much worse. She silently giggled, from thinking how silly that was. She had committed worse acts with Tommy, and this inexperienced guy couldn't match up to him. 

"Oh! Yes! Fill your Candy deep! Slowly!" Candy told him. 

Florence agreed with the advice. All recriminations vanished as he entered her. She had suffered being a vacuous air-head all week long, so why not take some enjoyment from the situation. She couldn't prevent it happening, so just gave in. 

The feeling of his cock moving up inside her vagina was electric. It ignited her senses. It felt as though he were filling her entire body with cock. 

"Faster now!" Candy pleaded, through panting gasps. 

Florence was lost on a wave of sensations, enjoying the fucking as much as Candy. She let herself go, to become one with the stupid girl. 

Damian didn't need telling. He was struggling to hold back from pounding into her. Instinct took over for him to start furiously thrusting. 

"Yes! Damian, fuck me hard!" she cried out. 

He pounded away at her. His hips slammed against her. His thighs slapped her bottom. His cock rammed into her. 

"I'm cumin, oh, Damian! Keep going," she yelped. 

Florence was moaning silently. She too implored Damian to pound away at her, though her pleas went unheard. Not that she needed to say anything for she agreed with Candy. 

There was no way he could stop now. He twitched and pressed home, pushing her forward with his thighs, holding her back with a firm grip of her hips. He held still, pumping his sperm into her. 

"Your filling me up!" she cried out. Her legs vibrated in rhythm with his twitching cock. 

Florence felt every movement, every twitch of his cock buried deep inside. Her vagina flexed around him, gripping tight. 

They collapsed upon the bed, entwined in each other's arms. He held her close. her naked body was a work of art. It was the most wonderful thing in the world. She was wonderful. Life was great. 

Candy kissed his face and licked his lips. She nibbled on his lips, and sucked on one. "Candy loved the wonderful orgasm, Damian," she purred. 

Florence agreed. 

"Can I try on a dress now," she moaned, while prodding him with a finger. 

He laughed at her. "Sure anything Candy wants," he grinned. 

Florence liked the choice of underwear. She usually only wore stockings and suspenders for her husband's benefit, yet now they seemed nice. Or as Candy would say they were fab! Florence giggled with happiness, from still feeling the afterglow of a deep orgasm. 

*** 

Matthew waved goodbye to Catherine. He leaned against the doorframe feeling exhausted. There was no need to play kinky games with her. She was wild and inspiring. He went to the bedroom to rest. 

It was then he realised it was fortunate they hadn't made it here. How could he explain away his wife's things. The dressing table was covered with toiletries, perfumes, and feminine things. 

A wave of guilt hit him. it was wrong to have let Catherine back into his life. It should have been kept a holiday romance; just a onetime mistake. He should have brought Florence home and brought her out of the hypnotic state. He considered the nasty episode with Damian, yet still felt unable to justify letting her down. It wasn't a reckoning for what she did, it was a convenience leaving her with Bernard. His wife was safely out of the way while he had it away with another woman. Before he could sink into a guilt trip, the phone rang. It was Bernard on his mobile, probably asking him to collect her. 

"Is she alright? Oh good. Her mother? Well, it's her aunt really, Florence's other sister who looks after her. She's in hospital, and can't be contacted," he improvised. 

Matthew was flustered when Bernard asked for the phone number. He wanted to talk to her mother. 

"Florence phoned to tell me she will be in for a couple more days. I can collect her after the meeting as we arranged. Oh! Err, I guess that would be OK. I won't bother her aunt to ask permission. I'm sure she will be alright with Mable," Matthew agreed. 

Florence would hate staying there a few more days. The woman wasn't dumb, but she wasn't exactly scintillating company either. His wife enjoyed talking politics and philosophy with friends at dinner parties, which was a complete opposite of the game she played as a dumb blonde. 

He shook his head, again wondering why she played these stupid games. 

The phone rang again. "Hi Catherine. Yes, that was really something. Tomorrow? Well, yea, I guess so. Try something different? Oh! Not Chinese," he laughed. "OK. Can't wait!" he said. 

Matthew looked around the room. It wouldn't take much to hide everything. There was bound to be boxes in the basement. He wondered if he should. "What the hell!" he said out loud. 

*** 

Next morning Florence awoke to a gentle knock on the door. "Morning Candy, sleep well?" Mable asked. "Come on sleepy head, we have a day of shopping ahead of us. Shower, dress, breakfast, then we hit the stores," Mable beamed. 

She was pleased with Damian's change of attitude. She was pleased with her husband because he arranged for Candy to stay a few extra days. Most of all, she was happy to have a, well, a daughter for a little while. While making breakfast, she thought how wonderful it would be for Candy to move in. 

Perhaps they could adopt a child. It had never been discussed, though maybe she could broach the subject when Bernard got home. That is, if the meeting went well. 

Feeling refreshed, Florence looked forward to spending the day with Mable. Although she was only a few years older, the woman was matronly and a good mother. Cindy was enthusiastic about going shopping, as expected. She had to admit, she felt the excitement too. 

It would be a change to let someone else guide her, and make the decisions like a mother would. There was a shared feeling with Candy, of being cared for when Mable was around. Candy and Mable enjoyed small talk, lightly fluttering over breakfast. 

Florence heard Mable say something important, among the talk of preferred stores and fashions. Matthew had agreed to let her stay for a few days. Here! Surely he must realise the consequences of being hypnotised for so long. It had been more than week under the influence of the Cindy personality. 

She had lost control of the silly girl after just a few hours. At least for awhile she had been able to influence her to some degree. Cindy was independent enough to completely ignore her. She had to get home for Matthew to remove the hypnosis. 

Mable leaned over and kissed her forehead. The woman cupped her chin in warm hands. Florence listened to the reassurance that her aunt would be fine, and out of hospital soon. 

"I can be your mom for a couple of days. I'll look after you, so don't worry about a thing. Wont it be nice?" Mable asked, with a pleading look in her eyes. 

"Sure Mable, I'd like that. We could play at being mom and daughter, if you like," Candy said. 

How could she say no. She couldn't say anything anyway, but still, she agreed with Candy's enthusiasm. It would be nice, to have a mother for a little while. Florence felt that something was wrong, that she was missing something. A nagging doubt was trying to surface. It was something to do with agreeing with Candy. 

There was no harm in agreeing with Candy, was there? After all, she had created her. It was her alter ego. Candy was right, Mable was wonderful, and she would enjoy going shopping with her. 

"I'm such a silly thing. I was rushing to get dressed so we could go shopping," Candy giggled. 

She had forgotten to put on panties, and Florence giggled with Candy. She had done the same thing a very long time ago. 

"Well, you had better go and put some on. Wearing that short skirt you need something substantial under it. You don't want the boys seeing you're bare bottom," Mable chastised her, though she suppressed a laugh. 

Florence giggled as much as Candy over the silly mistake. Of course she didn't want the boys to see her bottom, unless it was Damian. That was alright, because he was her boyfriend. He had seen it all anyway, so there was no harm in it. 

Candy didn't say anything about that, which pleased Florence. She had the added pleasure of playing with Damian when they returned from shopping, so it would be a wonderful day. Florence giggled at the naughty thoughts she had. As an experienced woman she could teach Damian a lot of naughty games. 

In her bedroom she put on a sensible pair of panties, as Mable had told her to. She held a tiny thong thinking it would be more fun to wear. Candy would like it too, but Florence had to be a good girl, and do as she was told. 

Florence skipped down the hall, looking forward to trying on Barbie outfits Mable had promised to buy her.  

===

Florence skipped into the lounge looking forward to a shopping trip for clothes with her new mother figure. 

The game of being hypnotised as a young carefree air-head, had spiralled out of control, leaving her helpless in its powerful grip. She gave up struggling with her alter ego, named Candy, to simply accept her. Being taken shopping for clothes excited Candy, and so she too became enthusiastic. 

She was painfully aware of how wrong this was, and why it was happening. For over a week she had been subjected to Candy's silliness, until it began to influence her thinking to. It was so comforting to have a caring mother again after so long, Mable filled a deep longing and a heartfelt loss. Those feelings combined with the Candy alter-ego to overwhelm her feelings. 

Mabel had lost her daughter in childbirth, and her emotional needs also swamped Florence's resistance. She couldn't help feeling and behaving like Mabel's lost daughter. She was a mature married woman acting out the role of a young air- head girl. At first it had been embarrassing, then it became humiliating, turning to downright dangerous. Even worse, was knowing she was taking on Candy's behaviour and way of thinking. 

In the mall Mable led her by the hand, while they aimlessly chatted about clothes, shoes, and handbags. Candy responded equally inanely with girly talk, about make-up and fashions. She just loved the idea of a make-over. Mable was delighted having Candy to replace the daughter she lost. Florence was happy to have a mother figure, after losing hers at an early age. They were a comfort to each other. 

If Mable hadn't needed Candy to be a young girl so badly, she might have noticed Candy was older than she acted. Her young complexion allowed her to pass for eighteen, but Mable wanted her to be younger, and so that is how she viewed the twenty-eight year old woman. 

It would be devastating if she found out Florence was a married woman, and Florence's husband worked for Bernard, her husband. Mable continued with the farce, encouraging her new daughter to try on girly dresses. Mable's fascination with Barbie dolls was reignited as they found a new range of pink party dresses. 

"Oh Fab! I just love pink!" Candy gushed. "The panties are so gorgeous, mummy," Candy chirruped, while lifting the flouncy hem to show them off. Written across the front of the pink panties was, 'I'm a Barbie Girly'. 

Mable was about to tell her to pull the dress down as they were outside the changing room. Being called mummy hit her hard. She looked at Candy with pride, glowing warm and emotional. Tears formed in the corners of her eyes, which she dabbed with the corner of a hanky. 

"You look wonderful, Candy. We'll take all the clothes. You'll need shoes next," Mable enthused. 

Candy wrapped her arms around Mable, for a tight hug. Looking up into her face she smiled warmly. "Thank you mummy, you're wonderful too," Candy said, with a look of adoration. 

They walked hand in hand through the mall, window shopping as they went. Mable readily agreed to let her wear the short dress, which bounced up over the petticoats, showing off the little panties. It was meant for dressing up at home, rather than to be worn outside, but how could she refuse the pretty little girl anything her heart desired. 

In the store front windows the image reflected back at Florence, reinforced her role as Mabel's little girl. Her blonde hair had been fashioned in pigtails with pink ribbons, and the pretty pink dress floated high around her thighs revealing bottom hugging matching panties. Even her shoes were pink flats. 

It was enough to make even the least fashion conscious young girl sick, and die of shame. Candy swung her hips for the hem to float up, delighting in the swish of petticoats and silk. She wanted to swirl around the mall like a ballerina on tiptoe. 

"Hi Mable, how you doing?" Denise asked. She knew Mable wouldn't ask why she was out of the office while the boss was away 

"Hello, I'm great thank you, and you?" Mable greeted the woman. "This is Candy, my, err, my little girl," Mabel stuttered. 

Denise screwed up her face, looking curiously at Candy. She quickly recovered to greet her, "Hi Candy. You look, mmm, lovely," she said, with a strained voice. 

Candy beamed a bright smile at the woman, then ignored her to study a range of shoes on display. 

"Would you do me a favour. I need to freshen up. Could you look after Candy for a moment?" she asked. She was worried about her make-up after the tears. 

"Sure. Let's go for a soda, Candy," Denise smiled. She studied Candy for a moment, with a curious look. When Candy reached for her hand, she automatically held it as they walked away. 

After a sip of coffee Denise sat back in the seat to take a good look at the girl. She had seen her somewhere before, and it was annoying not to place her. She was good with faces, and as Bernard's secretary she knew they only had a son. Closely studying the girl it was obvious she was older than the clothes portrayed. 

Her boss and his wife were dark haired, not blonde like Candy. While Candy made slurping noises Denise went through a mental list of blondes she knew. Dismissing the bleached ones left a very short list. 

"Are you related to Matthew and Florence?" Denise asked. 

"Sure. My aunt and uncle," Candy said, and continued to suck noisily at the strawberry shake. 

Florence cringed over the question, as the woman was close to recognising who she was. There was nothing she could do or say to divert discovery, even if she could have prompted Candy. 

Denise was probing Candy, who thankfully gave short meaningless answers, while concentrating on her favourite pink milk shake. It was a relief when Mabel returned. Candy brightened up and wanted to know if they were shopping, or going home. 

"I just can't wait to try on those fab outfits you bought me mom," Candy gushed. 

"Sorry Denise, we've got to get home. Any news from Bernard, about the meeting?" she thought to ask. 

"Nothing yet. I'm sure he'll swing it with Matthew along," Denise smiled. She watched the two of them hurrying away. There was something odd about that girl, even though she was dressed in cos-play. She had to get back to the office, so paid the bill and forgot about it. 

In the kitchen Mable was starting the evening meal while Candy unpacked a few bags. 

"No you don't young lady. Wait till after dinner," Mable playfully scolded Candy. 

"Oh! OK!" she reluctantly agreed, and put away the lolly pops. 

"You had better change out of that dress in case you spoil it," Mable added. 

"While in your room you can hang up the outfits we bought. Go on, run along," Mable told her. 

Candy skipped to her room singing a pop song, badly out of tune in her usual high pitched, squeaky voice. 

"Honey, I'm home," Bernard shouted. 

From the sound of his voice Mable knew he was in a good mood. She was preparing his favourite, lasagne, and would soon start working on him to get her way. 

Bernard walked in to find his wife beaming with pleasure, as much as he was. "Contract signed and sealed!" he boasted. 

After a long hug Mabel looked at him closely. "I've had such a nice day with Candy, I was wondering," she said, and paused. 

"Wondering what?" he asked. 

"Well. Could you persuade Matthew to let her stay a little longer?" she blurted out the words. Giving him a sideways pleading look, was designed to gain his agreement. The hopeful look in her eyes transmitted a bucket full of emotion. 

Bernard was in a good mood, ready and confident to tackle any negotiation thrown at him. 

"Of course. I'm sure he'll be glad of the chance to taste some freedom while Florence is away," he winked at his wife, telling her all will be alright. He knew why she wanted the girl around, and why it pleased her so much. 

Back in his study he sat next to Matthew, who was busy at the computer. 

"That's good Matthew. We need to get the notes filed while they're fresh in our minds. By the way, how's her mother?" he enquired. 

"Her mother died a few years ago, it's her aunt who's ill. She's been looking after her since. Florence is there, looking after the house and visiting her in hospital," Matthew carefully spoke. He didn't want to get caught out in a lie. Before he could ask about Florence, Bernard cut in. 

"While the cat is away the mouse will play," he chuckled. "Candy can stay here for a couple of days. Mable likes her and it will give you a chance to enjoy some peace and quiet," Bernard grinned. 

"Err, I'm not sure. What does Candy want to do?" he nervously asked. Hell! He was already in trouble with Florence for letting Bernard taking her away. 

"No problem, I'm sure. You carry on with the report while I check," Bernard said. 

He felt sure he could persuade her to stay. After all, he had just completed a lucrative deal with those hard headed executives, so that girl should be easily persuaded. Mable would be pleased, and so he would be too. 

"Come in," Candy distractedly said. 

"Oh! I'll come back," Bernard suggested. 

"Come in. I need your help," Candy whined. "Which do you think is most scrummy?" she asked, while holding up two outfits on hangers. 

Bernard tried not to look at her. The two outfits she held up framed her body which was clad in brief underwear. 

"Not sure, sweetie. You'd have to ask Mable, I'm just a man," he gruffly spoke, trying to remain calm. He remembered why he was there, and cleared his throat. "Would you like to stay for a few days, with Mable. You can go out shopping for stuff, if you like," he asked. 

"Oh! Fab!" she yelped with pleasure. 

"I'll take that as a yes. Get changed and come and see your uncle in my study. We'll see what he says," he told her, and left. She hadn't inherited the family brains. Her aunt, Florence was a clever woman, yet this girl was certainly a dizzy blonde. 

Damian crawled out from under the bed. "Before you get dressed we'll continue the game," he told her, with a big smile on his face. 

"Are you sure, I'm supposed to go and see my uncle," she queried, with a frown creasing her brow. Florence knew her husband would be keen to take her home, so at last she would be escaping this dream like state. 

"You have to do as your told, remember," he quickly reminded her. 

"OK. If I do that blow thing for you do you promise to make me orgasm?" she demurely asked. 

"Yea, of course," he promised. He heard his father say she might be staying a few days. If so, there was plenty of time for a blow job, and would fit in as many as he could. So to keep her happy he decided to fuck her. 

"Get undressed and I'll fuck you now," he gleefully told her. 

"Oh! Goody, Candy loves fucking," she brightly smiled. 

Florence wasn't so pleased at all. Her husband was nearby, ready to collect her, and here she was giving her sex away to this boy. At least Candy enjoyed it. Candy was uninhibited and let herself go like a dirty slut, which is something she had never been able to do. 

Florence could hardly prevent Candy from doing what she wanted, and now the silly girl was making all the decisions. Since being here it seemed she was even beginning to think like Candy. When she crawled onto the bed on hands and knees, Florence felt a tingle of anticipation. She was already hot, and as ready for him as much as Candy. 

Damian intensely stared at her bare ass for a moment. She was on hands and knees with her thighs parted, showing off her sex. It was swollen and glistening wet. She was always ready for him, and complied with whatever he wanted her to do. 

The slut enjoyed it, and never complained, so why not take advantage while she was here. He had heard about anal sex, and wondered if she would accept it. Would that be going too far even for her? There wasn't time now. He grabbed her hips and slammed his cock into her. 

Candy moaned quietly as she had been told not to make a noise. He moved her hips in time with his thrusts, rocking her head back and forth. Her long blonde hair was swirling around her head as she swung it around. She was really getting into it. Pushing back on him, she gasped as he pounded deeply into her vagina. 

She dropped her head into the bed covers to muffle a scream. He continued to thrust into her wet hole, using her body for his own pleasure. She didn't care for she had an orgasm, so just let him get on with it. She felt him tense while deeply imbedded inside her body. He had a long thin cock, and it was shuddering. Knowing he was spurting cum into her vagina brought on another little orgasm. She gripped his cock with inner muscles rippling around it. 

He slid her off the bed onto her knees. She didn't need telling. She grabbed his cock to lick it clean, then sucked it into her mouth, tasting the last of his cum. She opened her mouth to show him a drop of it on her tongue. 

"You're a great cock sucker, Candy. Go on, you can swallow it," he added. 

"Mmm! Candy loves your cum. Thank you for giving me a scrummy orgasm. Can we do it again later?" she asked. 

Florence was glad to be leaving with her husband, for this boy was becoming more and more demanding. There was no telling what he might get Candy to try next. She was proving to be a really dirty little slut. It was important to shed the hypnotic influence as soon as possible as she too was shedding her inhibitions. 

It would take some time to recover her normal self after all she had been through. How much of Candy's way of thinking would be influencing her once brought round was worrying. She dare not ever be hypnotised again, not ever. 

Candy pulled on a pair of figure hugging, stretchy shorts, with an equally tight top. She fixed her hair in the familiar pig tails, and admired herself in a mirror. She skipped down the corridor to Bernard's office. 

"Hi uncle," she demurely said. 

Matthew looked at his wife, wondering what she was playing at. In his boss's home it was embarrassing to see her posing as a teenager. On a married woman the shorts looked obscenely wrong. They fit tight at the crotch, splitting her sex in two. When she bent over to pick up a piece of paper both men's eyes followed her ass, where the thin material creased her cheeks. 

All the time Bernard thought she was his young niece, he was safe from ridicule. What in hell Bernard would think if he found out she was his wife, he didn't like to think about. The game had gone way beyond the point of explaining it away as a prank, or mistake. 

If he found out his son had been having sex with her, he might be fired. Matthew had seen them together in the basement, which still left him fiercely angry. He wondered what they had been up to all day. 

"How's Damian?" Matthew asked. 

"Haven't seen him yet. He's quietly studying. Which is another reason for her to stay. He's been well behaved since meeting her. Candy has been out shopping with Mable, so they haven't seen each other all day," Bernard said, as he caught on to Matthews fears. 

Matthew hoped Damian had what he wanted and was leaving her alone. It was probably too dangerous to get up to anything at home with his parents around. Why Florence had let him do those things to her in the basement, he still couldn't understand. Surely she could resist the hypnotic suggestions if they were getting out of hand. 

"Can I go help mom in the kitchen now?" Candy asked. 

Florence could feel Damian's cum leaking from her. In front of her husband and his boss it was horribly humiliating. Any moment a wet patch would show in the shorts. 

"Wait a moment, do you want to stay for a few days and go shopping with Mable?" Bernard asked. 

"Oh! Cool! I can't wait to tell mom," Candy trilled, and rushed out of the room. 

Matthew hadn't a chance to stop her. He meant to say she had to come home, despite his boss's pressure to have her stay. He had been so surprised to hear his wife mention her mom, it threw his ideas on why she was behaving this way. Did this explain why she was agreeing to stay here, that she had found a substitute mother figure. 

When they played games she never behaved so much in character, as a dumb blonde. Now she seemed to be deeply immersed in the role. He should have insisted she come home, but it was too late now. 

"I'll have to take her home in a couple of days, to her aunt," Matthew said. 

"Give me her number and I'll talk to her about Candy staying over while she's ill," Bernard offered. 

"I'll phone you tomorrow," Matthew nervously spoke. There was no aunt, so how could he do that. He was digging himself deeper into the mire. Once home he could think it through and put things right. For the moment he immersed himself in work, to finish the report with Bernard. 

Florence left the room feeling let down. Her husband should have taken her home. If he had spoken to her privately he could have lifted the hypnotic influence to override Candy. As Florence she would have agreed to go home and recover from this alter-ego. 

When she entered the kitchen all her doubts vanished. She rushed up to Mable for a big hug, and enthusiastically told her she was staying. 

"I'm so pleased!" Mable exclaimed. "You can set the table for dinner, while I finish up here," she added. 

As a married woman Florence knew how to help around the kitchen, which impressed Mable. She was concerned about the way Candy dressed, but accepted that young people were like that today. Besides, anything that Candy wanted she would do to keep her happy. 

After dinner Candy eagerly went off with Damian to play some game, leaving Mable to work on her husband. 

"Honey, you know, Candy is a lovely girl. Wouldn't it be nice to have her stay for awhile," Mable suggested. 

"Matthew needs to take her back to her aunt, so don't get too attached," he warned. 

Seeing such a look of sadness cloud her face pushed him into softening the blow. "He's going to phone me tomorrow with her number. I'll talk to her. See what I can do," he smiled, and kissed her cheek. 

"You're so clever, you can do anything. I know you can talk her into letting Candy stay for awhile longer," Mable said, brightening up. "Is she still in hospital," she asked. 

"I'll find out. Maybe she needs to rest awhile, to recuperate," he said, and wrapped an arm around her waist. "That's a new dress isn't it?" he queried, to change the subject. 

"Mmm. I bought some other things too. The ones you like," she coyly spoke. 

It took him a moment or two for him to catch on. After being married for so long he knew not to ask what she meant. She had let herself go over the last few years, but now he looked at her, he noticed she had been to a salon. He held her hand, feeling her nails had been done too. 

"I feel bushed after shopping all day with Candy. I think I'll turn in early," she said, with a meaningful look. 

He got the message straight away this time. It had been sometime since they had done anything accept a quick easing of a basic need. He almost agreed to join her, then thought better of it. 

"I've had a busy day too. I'll tidy up the office and join you in a minute," he smiled, and softly kissed her lips. He would give her time to prepare, and he needed a shower. She scurried off to the bedroom with renewed energy. If this is what having a daughter around was doing for her, he would really work on the aunt as soon as he had the number. 

With an unfamiliar nervousness he entered the bedroom. The lights were low, and his wife was draped over the bed. She wore a tight corset pushing up her voluptuous breasts into a deep cleavage. Sheer stockings gripped her long shapely legs. She looked stunning! 

He stood at the end of the bed looking her over. He was reminded why he had introduced himself to her at a party, and why he had been uncharacteristically short of words. She was a shapely sexy woman, and knew how to entice him.  

===

"Do you like my new outfit?" she softly asked. The pouting lips were so seductive, he wanted to jump onto the bed and caress them. He knew better than that. He would have to take his time to seduce her. In the end they would both be ravenous for each other, so it was worth holding back. She had taught him this when they first met. 

The kids were on the other side of the house, so they could make as much noise as they liked. 

"You're like a movie star, my love," he crooned. She re-crossed her legs, making a sizzling noise with the stockings. She was pulling out all the tricks she knew, even though there was no need to entice him. From the moment he set eyes on her, he was hers. 

"I had a full wax today, I hope you don't mind," she said, and blew him a kiss. 

He looked at the white triangle of panties, seeing how closely they fitted. Her thighs parted a fraction, and were squeezed together again when she crossed her legs. Her body was fuller as she matured, but maturity meant she knew how to use it to pleasure him. 

They learnt together over the years how to please each other. After the shower he had put on her favourite silk suit, and was now peeling it off, trying not to be obviously theatrical. He remembered to remove the socks before the trousers, which she had once said was ugly, when in underwear and socks. 

"How long have I got with you?" he asked. 

"Depends on how much you want to pay," she teased back. 

"How much do you charge?" he asked, trying not to grin. 

"Depends on what you want," she pouted at him. She pushed her breasts out, and flicked her hair. 

"I want everything," he told her, and was finally stripped off. 

"Everything?" she said, with mock surprise. A hand went behind her, as though protecting her bottom. Her expression turned to anguish. 

"You can't have everything," she softly complained. 

"I've paid for you, for the whole night. I've paid for everything, so you have to do anything I want," he strongly intoned. 

"Oh! But you wouldn't, would you? Please sir, spare me. I'll do anything else, please," Mable implored. 

"What else will you do?" he teased. On the bed he lifted her chin so she couldn't turn away from him. 

"I can't say, it's embarrassing. I'll do naughty things, anything you want, sir. Please don't make me say them," she pleaded. 

This was his cue to make her say rude words. He didn't laugh, as he could see she was hot already, and would be more so as they continued. This was even before they touched each other. How long ago had it been since they played this game? He was certainly going to make a sales pitch to Candy's aunt. 

"Unless you tell me what else you have to offer, I'll just take your ass," he resolutely spoke. 

"Oh! No! Please, sir. You can have my pussy, sir," she timidly spoke, yet breathed heavily. Her breasts were heaving out of the corset with every breath. 

"What else?" he encouraged. 

"My, err, my mouth, sir," she said, wincing as though it were painful to say. 

He pushed his cock against a bare thigh, and nudged it further up, almost between her cheeks. 

"Please sir. If you lay back, I will kiss it nicely. Please, let me kiss your cock, sir," she gravely said. 

"Show me your pussy, I might want that," he gruffly stated. He dare not let her blow him, as he would spurt too quickly. He needed to wait until after her orgasm. It was important not to disappoint her, as he missed playing this game she loved so much. 

"Oh sir, I can't," she protested. 

"Then I will," he sternly said. He pulled the crotch of her panties to one side, to adore her shaven pussy. 

He kissed her pussy with a big wet kiss. "I bought this cunt for the night so it's mine. What do you say to that, whore," he demanded to know. 

"Please, sir, don't make me say that," she hoarsely whispered. 

"Say it whore," he told her. 

"This whore's cunt is yours sir," she said, while squirming with pleasure. 

Bernard pushed her thighs apart, and moved up her body. She gasped on feeling his cock brush against her bare thighs. His cock nudged her sensitive swollen lips. He rubbed it against her nub, pushing hard and persistently. 

"Please sir, be gentle with me," she panted. 

He pushed smoothly into her, feeling inner muscles grip tight. With a mighty effort he kept the pace slow, just as she needed it. 

*** 

Damian ran his finger around Candy's little puckered hole. He pushed a greased finger in while rubbing her clit. 

"Please, not there, Candy wants to feel your cock in her pussy," she complained. 

"Relax Candy," he told her. 

"Candy wants to be fucked, so she can cum, please," she whined. 

"You have to do as I say, don't you?" he asked, while pushing a finger deep inside her bottom. 

"Yes, I guess so. Candy wants to cum, please make Candy cum," she pleaded. 

"What do you want me to do then?" he asked, giving up on taking her ass. 

"Fuck my pussy, please!" she excitedly spoke, on feeling his finger pop out. 

"Call it your cunt, and what do you want in it," he teased. 

"My cunt wants your big cock to fuck it, please," Candy said, while squirming on his fingers. 

Florence hesitated over the idea of letting this boy do such naughty things to her. He was her boyfriend, and she had been told to do as she was told by Bernard, so of course she should. His finger rubbed her clit, making the decision for her. Florence needed a hard fucking and couldn't help urging him on. She desperately needed to cum, and her boyfriend was so good at it. 

When he turned her over onto her back, she spread her legs wide. Florence hesitated a moment, with the thought that something was amiss, and that she shouldn't be doing this. She reminded herself that he was her boyfriend so it was alright. 

Feeling his hard cock press against her open sex drove all doubts aside. She thrust up at him with her hips, to impale herself upon his cock. She whimpered a song of utter bliss. He was filling her up with cock, driving deep into her body. She sank into the soft bed, unable to move, letting him pound into her. She squirmed under him, letting him take her. 

She lifted her sex up to him so every hard stroke rubbed her clit. Every time he thrust in she trilled a warbling sound of pleasure. "Yes! Oh! Yes! Make your cunt cum," she crooned. 

She didn't feel his spurt of cum, but knew he had. It drove her over the edge into a long, satisfying orgasm. She wrapped her arms and legs around him. Her heels shuddered on his cheeks, then just gripped on tight. Her pussy clamped around his cock. 

As her breathing calmed down, Florence thought how clever Candy was to help her have so many delightful orgasms. She had learnt so much from Candy. How to let go and not worry about being dull and sensible. At last she could let go all her inhibitions. 

She had a wonderful boyfriend to fuck her, so was grateful to Candy for enticing him to her bed. She had a mom to look after her, and take her shopping for lovely clothes. Her life was perfect. She lay back letting him suck on her nipples, wallowing in the warm afterglow of the orgasm.

Chapter 06 

Florence escapes the family life 

"We can't go shopping today, Candy, there's too much housework to do," Mable said, hoping Candy wouldn't be too disappointed. 

"Ok! I love being with you, mom. I can help out," Florence smiled. 

The innocent look reached right into Mable's heart. It skipped a beat, and she took a deep breath. "We can clean house together, sweetie," Mable beamed a big smile at her new daughter. 

Florence had given up trying to control Candy, especially over the past few days while staying with Mable. She became completely in tune with the dumb girl personality, with a feeling of delight from having a caring mother again. It filled a great void in her life. The deep hypnosis allowed her to be Mable's little girl, otherwise it would never have worked out. 

Bernard, Mable's husband had looked at her with a curious expression more than once. If he guessed she was a mature, married woman, the game would be up, and everyone would be shocked. Worse than that, it would hurt Mable badly. It was the reason why he refused to listen to his instincts about Candy. 

Damian too had a reason not to doubt who she pretended to be. He was using her body every chance he got. Candy, the stupid blonde girl she was hypnotised to be, was happy for him to play with her. She had turned out to be a slut, which shocked Florence at first. 

Florence recognised the slutty behaviour was within in her, which allowed it to happen and develop. She could no longer blame it on being hypnotised as dumb blonde. The falling away of inhibitions was no longer blamed on Candy, so she just went along with it, and literally laid back to enjoy it. 

Why her husband let her be carted off while hypnotised, and hadn't rescued her yet, was still a mystery. She knew he wasn't the most forceful of men, yet surely he should have taken her home by now. 

"You're doing a marvellous job, Candy," Mable enthusiastically commented. 

"Like, thanks a bunch, mom. I used to help Auntie when, after, err. Well," Florence tried to say after her mother died, but the emotion overwhelmed her. 

Mable realised what she was trying to say, from the screwed up look of pain. She grabbed hold of Candy to give her a big hug. 

"You're a lovely girl and I'm proud to have you as my daughter," Mable whispered. She stroked her hair, while burying Candy's face in an ample chest. She took a firm hold of Candy's shoulders, pushing her back to look into her eyes. 

"Don't worry sweetie, you're a wonderful girl and there's nothing to worry about. I'll look after you, and I care about you so very much," Mable sincerely spoke. 

"Thank you mommy," Florence gratefully whispered, and gave Mable a big hug in return. 

Florence and Candy were in perfect agreement. They were deeply moved, and felt so relieved to hear the comforting words. Florence had lost her mother when she was a child, and had missed her all her life. Now she had regained a mother, she felt content. 

Mable had complimented Candy on how well she carried out household chores, not suspecting her little girl was an experienced housewife. 

Florence was happily dusting and polishing ornaments in the living room when she overheard Mable talking to Bernard. She couldn't help eavesdropping on their conversation. 

"I've asked him for her aunt's phone number but she's still in hospital. Don't worry honey, I'm sure they won't want Candy back until well enough to look after her. Until then we can look after Candy. I'm sure that will be for a few weeks," Bernard reassured his wife. 

"I'll miss her so much if she has to leave me," Mable sighed. 

Florence dropped the duster, and only just held onto a bone china doll. A few weeks! What was her husband playing at? Why wasn't he standing up against his boss? He should have taken her home to remove the hypnotic influence. She had been immersed in the role of a stupid blonde girl for too long. 

After only a week here she was losing her mind! Half the time she thought of herself as Mable's little girl, and with Damian she behaved like a stupid slut. It was too easy giving in to the overwhelming feelings of being loved by a mother figure. It was almost a relief to let loose the passions of a woman when with Damian. 

Florence flopped down on the sofa with her head in her hands. It was all too much to cope with. 

Mable walked in, guessing Candy had overheard the conversation, and assumed she was upset to hear her aunt was still in hospital. 

"There, there Candy. I'll look after you, don't worry your head over things you can't do anything about. Everything will work out, you'll see," Mable consoled Candy, and herself. 

Florence tried to tell her she wanted to go home. Candy sobbed into her shoulder, with the emotion flooding over Florence, wiping out her need to escape. 

"Leave the housework. Go and play with Damian. Tell him to leave his homework, and look after you for a bit," Mable said, while wiping tears from Candy's face. "Go on, do as your told, run along now," Mable told her. She needed some time alone, to think how she could keep Candy close to her. 

Florence needed consoling, and this was one way to escape the heavy dependence upon Mable. 

"Really! She said to leave off my homework to play with you? So what do you want to play?" Damian asked, with a sly grin on his face. 

"You know," Candy coyly answered, while swinging her hips from side to side. 

"Tell me," he grinned. 

Florence knew this was wrong, only she had discarded all reticence, and just went along with Candy. She felt herself heating up at the idea of abandoning herself to lust. Sex was so much more exciting now she was a slut. Without the usual inhibitions, she was able to let herself go for wonderful orgasms. She was in agreement with Candy, that she wanted sex, and wasn't afraid to tell him. 

"Candy wants an orgasm," she giggled, in a girly coquettish voice. 

"Get undressed and show me your sexy body," Damian told her. 

Candy peeled off her clothes, taking time over stripping off the bra and panties. She turned around as though shy, while peeling the panties from her bottom. Letting them fall to her ankles, she bent over to pull them free, instead of kicking them away. She turned her head to give him a smile, while shamelessly fluttering long eyelashes at him. 

She knew what was revealed when pressing her thighs together, feeling the lips of her swollen pussy protruding between them. It was all a part of the game she played now that she was a complete slut. 

Damian couldn't stand it any longer. His cock was throbbing so much he abandoned the idea of greasing her asshole. Instead, he grabbed her hips and pushed his cock between her thighs. She parted them, allowing him to rub his hardness over her engorged pussy. 

"Where do you want my cock, Candy?" he croaked from a dry throat. He hadn't much control left after watching her strip, only just enough to make her squirm. 

"Candy wants her boyfriends big cock in her cunt," she squealed in delight. 

Feeling him firmly drive in, she moaned with delight. "Fuck Candy hard!" she pleaded. 

Damian didn't need encouragement. He rocked her hips back and forth, flattening her against the wall, until she began to get the rhythm and pushed back. 

"Make Candy cum! Fill Candy with your lovely sperm!" she squeaked. 

Feeling him spurt his load into her, brought on a knee trembling orgasm. He held onto her breasts, squeezing them tight, holding her up. Inner muscles held onto his cock as long as possible. His cock began to shrink from her body, until it flopped against her thigh. 

He turned her around, squeezed her tight, then sat her on the bed. He stood between her thighs with his cock dangling. She gently and reverently took it into her small hands, then leaned forward to suck it into her mouth. She spent time carefully licking and sucking on it. 

Damian watched her roll his entire cock around in her mouth, obviously enjoying it. 

"You're a wonderful slut, Candy," he admiringly stated. 

"Thank you," she giggled, and went back to sucking him. 

Florence wasn't bothered or even noticed when the hypnotic influence was being deepened by those around her. Being told to do as she was told, and that she was a slut, didn't matter, as it was already deeply embedded in her mind. She automatically submitted to others, and thought of herself as a good little slut. 

"That's enough! You won't get it hard. Give me a rest," he sighed. 

He pushed her back onto the bed, and laid down beside her to suck on her tits. The nipples were still engorged and sensitive. She cooed appreciatively, and moaned when he bit them. 

His hand slid between her thighs, which she parted for him. He played with her sloppy pussy, and began to finger fuck her. She arched her back to push her cunt up at his fingers, ravenously sucking them in. His thumb rubbed her nub, just as she had taught him. 

This time she was a long time in reaching an orgasm. 

Florence was wondering what this young boy would think if he knew she was a married woman. He had his father's, employees wife, naked on his bed. He had his fingers in her pussy, and he was biting her nipples. Her legs were spread wide, and she was humping those delicious fingers. He would think she was a real dirty slut. The thought finalised a long, and wonderful journey to a deep orgasm. 

*** 

Matthew sat in the office staring at a computer screen filled with figures. His boss had asked for the non-existent aunt's phone number, and so far he had put him off. 

What was more worrying was that he had been hinting about keeping Florence for awhile. Bernard had been telling him about Mable, and how consoling it was to have Candy around, like the daughter she had lost. The whole stupid situation was getting out of hand. 

It was convenient to have her out of the way while he screwed Catherine, but it couldn't go on. He told Catherine that Florence had run off with a younger man, which was partly true. Perhaps he could cool it with Catherine by telling her Florence was coming back home. 

While his resolve held, he drove over to Bernard's house. 

"He's out, they both are," Damian sleepily said. 

"No problem. I'm here to see Candy, where is she?" Matthew asked. 

"I'll go get her," Damian said, looking furtive. 

Matthew stood in the hall watching him disappear into a room. They both reappeared looking dishevelled. He knew then what they had been up to. Shit! This young guy had been fooling around with his wife! 

"Come on, you're coming with me," Matthew firmly said, and gripped her wrist. 

"Tell your father I'm taking her to visit her aunt," Matthew crossly stated over his shoulder. 

Candy sat in the car with arms folded, looking peeved. 

"What have you been up to with that boy?" Matthew asked, trying not to sound angry. 

"Just playing games," Candy pouted, looking put out. 

Matthew could imagine what kind of games, but didn't want to. Hell! She had been there over a week with that boy, acting like a stupid young bitch. His anger increased as they neared home. 

*** 

"Get to your room and stay there!" he forcefully spoke. 

The door bell rang. Catherine walked in with a big smile on her face. "You look terrible," she said, and ran a palm over his cheek. "Work getting you down?" she added, looking concerned. 

"Come on, tell me all about it," she soothed. She sat him down on the sofa and fixed them both a drink. Sitting near enough to touch, but far enough away to watch him, she intently listened. 

". . . and I still have no idea what she was up to, during our week together," he sighed. 

"Fuck!" Catherine finally exclaimed. 

"Exactly!" he angrily emphasised. 

"I thought you said she could control what was going on?" Catherine mused. She was bemused by the tale, and more than anything, she hoped his wife would disappear again. 

"Usually. But she's been hypnotised for a several weeks. Maybe she's lost control of the Candy persona. She still wouldn't do something she didn't want to, I think, probably. Are you saying it's all my fault?" he murmured. 

She wasn't sure who was at fault, so avoided the question. 

"I could find out what happened if you like. Woman to woman, she might open up to me," Catherine suggested,. 

"Alright. Do what you like. I'm too worked up to talk to her," he needlessly pointed out. 

Catherine stood up, wondering what she was getting into. 

"So, what happens next? Where does this leave us?" she asked. 

"We're good together. I want it to last. Something has to be done with Florence," he offered lamely. 

Coming to terms with the fact his wife had been screwing around overshadowed his guilt over Catherine. Having said it, he now knew Catherine was his future. He just had to get out of the mess with Bernard and his wife. 

Catherine wasn't too sure she wanted to continue with him. It may have been her idea to play silly games while hypnotised, but he went along with it. Well, she didn't need to be hypnotised to behave like a slut, she enjoyed sex and knew what she liked. 

Florence was recovering from the smothering of her emotions by Mable. Candy was absorbed in the usual girly magazines, leaving Florence to try and clear her mind of all that she had been through. Being Mable's daughter no longer seemed so nice, more like a nightmare, now she had escaped Mable's overpowering need for a daughter. 

At last she was home and safe. When Matthew calmed down he would relieve the hypnotic state, and she could begin to recover. She tried to relax. It was easy to share Candy's evident pleasure over the fashion magazine. She let her mind drift, finding the pictures of young fashions amusing, yet pleasing in a simple way. 

A knock at the door woke her from the reverie. 

Taking a deep breath, Catherine walked into the spare bedroom. "Sorry!" Catherine stupidly said, thinking she had walked into the wrong room. 

The woman laying on the bed, glancing through a glossy magazine wasn't what she expected. She knew his wife was only twenty eight, yet this image was difficult to grasp. 

The woman was petite, wearing a pink top and skirt. Catherine wore short skirts, but not so skimpy. The woman glanced at her, then turned back to the girly fashion pictures. Her face was porcelain smooth, as were her legs and waist. Her hair was tied into pigtails, enhancing the adolescent look. 

Knowing she was a married woman left Catherine feeling creepy. It was no wonder everyone had been fooled. She cleared her throat. 

"You OK?" she asked. 

"I've been sent to my room. Am I in trouble?" Candy asked. 

The squeaky high pitched voice matched the image. Catherine decided to go along with it. 

"No, not really, maybe. I want to talk to you. See if we can sort this out, you know?" Catherine probed. 

Candy shrugged and went back to flicking through the magazine. 

"Did you enjoy your stay with Damian?" she asked. 

"Sure, like, he's my boyfriend, yea," Candy plainly stated. 

"Yea, of course. You must have, err, kissed a lot, I guess," she mused. 

"Like yea. He's a good kisser," Candy smiled. 

"What else is he good at?" Catherine warmly smiled. 

"Lots of things," Candy giggled. 

"I bet you cuddled in bed, and did things," Catherine laughed, trying not to sound false. 

It was hard work, but she managed to piece together what happened during the missing week, and while she was at Bernard's home. 

"Wow! He greased your ass? What did he do then?" Catherine asked in surprise. 

"Oh, nothing really. He fingered my asshole, but never got around to pushing in his thingy," Candy confided. 

"He said I was a wonderful slut, and meant it too," Candy gleefully added. 

"I guess you are, me too!" Catherine shared, and laughed along with her. 

Candy stood up to get another magazine. 

Catherine wrinkled her nose as the woman brushed passed her. The smell of sex wafted strongly around her. She remembered Matthew saying they came out of Damian's bedroom looking dishevelled, and this confirmed his suspicions. If the story wasn't enough then this was evidence of what his wife had been up to. 

"Lift your skirt, Candy," she firmly said. 

Candy looked confused, yet did as she was told. There was a slick wetness in the crotch of her panties. 

"Have you wet your panties?" Catherine asked, trying to sound sympathetic. 

"No! It's my boyfriends lovely cum," Candy boasted. 

"You don't want to wear them now, they look uncomfortable. Take them off and I'll get you some clean ones," Catherine encouraged her. 

Florence was outraged and embarrassed. She had worked out why her husband hadn't rescued her, and it was because of this woman. She was a few years older, around Matthews age. She was voluptuous and oozed sexuality. What else would she be doing here, except having an affair with him. 

It was embarrassing being treated like a kid in her own home. She felt terrible submitting to this woman, yet she couldn't stop Candy removing her panties. The mess in them was an awful indictment of her terrible behaviour. This damning evidence put her in her place. She felt guilty as hell, despite learning her husband had been having an affair. 

When the woman left the room, Florence wanted to shout at her. It had been so easy to fool Candy. The woman had her panties, soaked with a boys cum. She was obviously going to use them against her, by taking them to her husband. Damn! It was too late now. 

Damn them both to hell! She would have to face him when revived, but then he too had misbehaved. Not as badly as she had. 

Catherine walked into the lounge, to find Matthew on the phone. 

"He wants to know where Candy is! I told him I'm taking her to visit her aunt in hospital. I'm just glad he didn't ask what was wrong, because I can't remember what I told him," Matthew worriedly recounted. 

Catherine dropped the panties in his lap. 

"Not now!" he crossly spoke. 

"There hers, not mine. Calm down and we'll talk it through," she told him. 

She summarised what had happened over the last few weeks, while Matthew became more and more appalled. His face was white, with mixed emotions clearly passing across his face, of anger and guilt. 

"Bernard is putting on the pressure to have her back, but I can't let her go back there," Matthew emphasised, while pointing at his wife's discarded panties. 

"He'll come around here looking for her. I know how persistent Bernard can be," he morosely declared. 

"Then tell him you've left her at the aunt's. My sister can babysit until he gives up. It's either that, or send her back," Catherine calmly said. 

"I don't know. I can't send her back. They'll find out who she really is, and all hell will break loose. She's obviously been under too long," he said, looking agitated. 

"If you bring her round now, she'll cause you hell. Probably get you fired," Catherine quietly spoke, while stroking his hair. 

The image of his wife getting back at him was potent. He looked at Catherine, appreciating her advice and comfort. He felt good with her. She made him happy, in more ways than one. Florence had pressurised him to do better in his job, whereas Catherine accepted him as he was. They were good together in bed. He realised how incompatible Florence and he were. 

"Will she mind? I mean, will your sister be able to cope? Will you have to tell her?" Matthew asked. 

Catherine smiled at him and kissed his lips with her luscious mouth. "Leave it to me darling. I'll take her now. When I get back I'll give you a nice soothing massage," Catherine promised. 

"I don't want any nonsense from you, just do as you are told. Got it?" Catherine sternly stated. 

"Yea, OK!" Candy meekly replied. 

*** 

Florence wondered where this woman was taking her. The tale she gave Candy wasn't enough to fool her. It was obvious the woman knew who she was, yet treated her like a stupid girl. Being given a lolly pop was demeaning. The way she was being hurried out of her home was worrying. At least it wasn't back to Mable.  

===

"Hi Craig," Catherine beamed at her brother. 

"What do you want?" Craig suspiciously asked. 

"Don't be like that, I've brought you a present," she stated, with a false pout of disappointment. "Go to the bathroom, Candy, while I talk to my brother," Catherine briskly told her. 

"That's your present, like?" she asked. 

"She's not my type. What are you playing at?" he asked. 

"She's over eighteen, with tits, long legs, and something between them that she knows how to use. She's your type," Catherine emphasised. 

"I still don't know what you're up to!" he scowled at her. 

Catherine told him only what he needed to know. He now looked suspicious and incredulous. 

"She looks more than eighteen. Why is she dressed like that?" he asked. 

"Dress her how you like. Here's some money, buy her clothes. She'll do whatever you say. You get that don't you!" she jeered him along. 

"Anything?" he wanted to know. 

"Yes, anything. All you have to do is keep her around. I'll pay you each week to look after her," she firmly stated. 

He nodded his head, still wondering what the catch was. 

"Candy! Come here," Catherine shouted. 

Florence walked in hoping Candy would keep the skirt down. In the bathroom she realised the woman hadn't brought her clean panties as promised. She'd forgotten to ask for them when suddenly whisked away from her home. What was happening she still couldn't work out. 

"That's a lovely skirt, give us a twirl Candy," Catherine told her. 

Florence groaned inwardly. The stupid girl was all smiles from the compliment, and span on tiptoe, like a ballerina. Seeing the boys eyes light up confirmed she had show off her ass, and everything else. Yet another nineteen year old was ogling her nakedness. 

"Candy, listen to me carefully. This is your new boyfriend. I want you to do whatever he says. You must obey him. OK?" Catherine forcefully spoke. 

"Oh! Like, yea, cool," Candy confirmed. There was a look of doubt in her eyes, but she submitted. 

Florence was livid. How dare this woman screw her husband and get rid of her so shabbily. The woman knew what had happened over the last weeks, and realised full well what she was doing to her. Shit! Her husband's mistress was giving her away to a teenager to become his sex toy! 

"Give your boyfriend a big kiss. Come on, sit on his lap. Give him a big smacker," Catherine ordered. 

Craig was embarrassed. He kept his arms away from her when she sat on his lap. Candy eagerly wrapped her arms around him, and kissed deeply. She wrapped her tongue around his, which he found difficult to resist, and soon joined in. 

"So what do you like to do with your boyfriend, Candy," Catherine asked. 

"Ooo! I like to fuck!" Candy giggled. 

Florence was appalled. She was being given away as a present to this woman's brother. She was being dumped out the way so the bitch could move in on Matthew. The feeling of helplessness squashed her into a corner of her mind. Shrinking away from the terrible situation, and shutting it out was all she could do. 

"It's getting late, Candy. Best get to bed, for an early night," Catherine told her, and dismissively waved at the bedroom door. 

She and her brother watched Candy contentedly skip into the next room. 

"I don't believe it. She's a lot older than eighteen. What are you up to?" he growled at his sister. 

"Don't you like your present? Can't cope with an older woman? I help pay for this apartment, and now I'm furnishing it for you. She's a dream girl. Whatever you want, she'll do. Just keep her well away from where I'm staying. Deal?" she smiled. 

*** 

Craig looked in at the woman sprawled over his bed. She was naked, and comfortable with it. She hadn't any reservations about showing off her body. It looked good too. 

"Come on, get on the bed," Candy brazenly said. 

Florence watched him slowly get undressed. He looked warily at her, as though she might bite. Of course, to him it must seem too good to be true. Candy was eagerly watching him, and getting heated up in anticipation. Florence felt the full effects of what was happening to her body, unable to resist the sexual arousal. 

Damn! She was being passed from one guy to another. As a married woman this was disgusting, but as a slut what did she expect? 

'I'm just a stupid slut,' Florence silently groaned. 

"Oooo! Like wow! You have such a big cock, Candy loves your big cock already," Candy giggled. 

Craig slid onto the bed with a grin on his face. He figured he could get used to the stupid girly voice if she continued to praise him like that. His sister had told him she was a woman hypnotised to be a stupid slut, but he hadn't believed her. He suspended disbelief as she wrapped her arms around him for a full on kiss. She squirmed her lithe, naked body tightly against his 

At first it was a wrestling match as they both tried to get on top. Eventually he held her away. 

"What do you want, Candy?" he asked. 

"Like, Candy wants an orgasm, please," she breathlessly moaned. 

"You want to get on top?" he asked. 

"Whatever!" she breathlessly spoke, while playing with his cock. 

"Do you have to do as I say?" he asked. 

"Yea! Of course, your my boyfriend," she pouted, still trying to get at him. 

He held onto her for a moment, trying to decide what to do with her. Hell! It seemed there was plenty of time to play with her, as his sister wanted her kept out of the way. 

"Get on top and do your thing," he grinned. 

Candy squealed with pleasure and pounced on him. With her thighs either side of his, she wriggled her hips, to guide her soaking wet lips over his hard rod. She gently lowered her pussy over the head of his cock, and froze. She wriggled around on it for a moment, delirious with pleasure. 

She pressed down, filling her aching hole. Her eyes widened on feeling it hit the back of her vagina. "Oh! That feels so good!" she screeched. 

She couldn't move. It was stretching her inside, filling her body with wonderful sensations while she trembled with delight. She was impaled on him, quivering with pleasure. Feeling him thrust up with powerful leg muscles, she whimpered excitedly. 

"Oh! Yesssss! Fuck your Candy, fuck Candy hard," she groaned. 

Her arms flopped at her sides, and her breasts jiggled. He reached for them, squeezing tight, and pinched the over sensitised nipples. All she could feel was the pounding of his hardness, moving powerfully, forever upward, deeply inside. Every thrust travelled long and hard. When it pushed against her cervix she let out a yelp of astonished delight. 

"Make Candy cum, please!" she encouraged. 

He speeded up, with rougher strokes tingling her vagina. She felt him explode, imagining his sperm spraying directly into her womb. He was filling her up with lovely sperm. It triggered a deep orgasm, leaving her huffing and puffing. Wavering like a rag doll on his cock, she whimpered unintelligible words, meant to express animal pleasure. 

He pulled her onto his chest, and lifted her off his cock with both knees. They stuck together with sweat. The exertion left them exhausted. She dozed on his chest, with him already fast asleep. 

On the drive back to Matthew, she kept laughing to herself. Like her, Craig had a high sex drive. He would soon get used to having a willing sex bomb in his bed. He wasn't one for dumb blondes, but once tasted, he would find the flavour addictive. 

With the stupid wife out of the way the husband was all hers. He was already hooked, and she was falling in love with him. He was good in bed, and was quickly learning what turned her on. He was considerate and in turn deserved looking after. He had been looking after a spoilt brat of a wife, so he appreciated her. 

Florence had nagged him into getting her own way, but Catherine didn't need to do that. She was happy to please him, and happy that he was pleased with her. As she pulled into the drive, she wondered what could go wrong. Well, only time would tell.  

===

Florence is passed to another randy guy 

Florence was hypnotised to be a stupid blond bimbo, called Candy. It started out as a fun game with her husband, only it all went wrong while he wasn't around to protect her. Being hypnotised for several weeks deepened the influence, until Florence lost all control of the bimbo persona. Candy was stupidly doing whatever she was told to do, and Florence had to withstand the consequences. 

Every time Candy slept with a guy, it affected Florence too, as it was her body being used. Arousal swamped her brain with hormones, meaning Florence became as sexually excited as Candy. She had no choice, except to go along with Candy's stupid behaviour. Florence was in despair. She was beginning to believe the rest of her life would be spent as Candy, the stupid bimbo. 

*** 

Craig was fed-up being stuck with the dumb bimbo. He couldn't leave her alone in the apartment for too long, as she would get into some sort of trouble. Yesterday she left the gas stove on without lighting it, and nearly blew up the apartment. He was getting cabin fever, so he just had to get out and meet some friends. 

His sister, Catherine, paid him to look after Candy, without revealing who she was. 

Catherine had fallen for Florence's husband, and left the woman with Craig to keep her out of the way. It had been easy to manipulate the woman while she was a stupid bimbo, so ordered her to obey Craig, as a boyfriend. Leaving her with Craig, left Catherine free to move in on Florence's husband. 

'Come on we're going out,' he told her. 

'Like, wow, we going shopping then?' Candy brightly said. 

'Maybe. Haven't you got anything else to wear?' he asked, sounding exasperated. 

He didn't know what his sister had brought with Candy, as she walked around the apartment in her underwear. He liked to watch her large breasts bounce in the small under-wired cups. He looked through the wardrobe as he couldn't trust her to pick something decent. There wasn't much to choose from. 

His sister had brought Candy over with the most terrible outfits she had. He figured Catherine had done this on purpose. He looked her over, and decided she'd picked the least gaudy of the outfits. The short pink dress would have looked cute on a kid, but she was well over eighteen. If the lighting was poor she could be mistaken for being much younger, except a pair of large breasts were a clue to her real age. 

'Just try and keep the dress down,' he told her. 

Florence was grateful to Craig for giving Candy such a basic instruction. Candy took everything he said as an order, and was stupid enough to follow literally whatever he said. 

That nasty bitch, his sister, packed the clothes. The underwear sets were flimsy and see-through. The outfits Mable bought were suitable for a young teenager, and unfortunately Candy loved the pink Barbie outfits. One of the t- shirt's had emblazoned across the chest, "Barbie Girl", in large glittery letters. The only pair of panties that wasn't a g-string, had "Barbie" written on them. 

What her panties were like under jeans, or even a long skirt, didn't matter. All Candy had to wear were short skirts, and dresses. They seemed to be designed to balloon up on the slightest breeze. Florence was naturally reluctant to leave the apartment looking like a fool. 

She also wanted to stay in case Catherine returned to take her home. Knowing the woman was moving in on her husband, she considered it a forlorn hope. Resigned to her fate, she retreated into a corner of her mind, letting Candy carry on with her stupid behaviour. 

'Cool! Like, it's nice to be out with my boyfriend,' Candy cooed. 

She had an arm wrapped in Craig's as they walked into a pool hall. He sat her down and walked over to a friend. The place was empty, and he didn't like the idea of spending time with the stupid guy. One was driving him mad, so between the two of them he would lose it altogether. 

'How you doing, Mickey?' Craig asked. 

'Alright, I guess. Who's she? Your new girlfriend?' Mickey asked. 

He wasn't going to admit to that, so he said, 'No. I'm looking after her for my sister.' 

'Nice,' Mickey commented. 

'Look Mickey, would you do me a favour? I just want you to look after her for a couple of hours. I need to do some stuff,' he asked. 

'Sure, no problem. You off to score? You can bring back some for me, yea?'' Mickey beamed a smile of anticipation. 

'No, nothing like that. Look, she just needs watching, otherwise she gets into bother. Come over here Candy,' he said. 

Candy was sitting chewing gum, like a contented cow. She skipped over to the two of them, looking pert and happy. 

Mickey watched her tits bounce, with the little dress bouncing up in time with them. He could see what his friend meant about her getting into trouble. 

'This is Mickey, he's going to look after you while I'm gone. Do as he tells you,' he firmly told her. 

Florence silently groaned in dismay. She knew something would go wrong while the stupid one was out, away from the apartment. Surely Craig knew what Candy was like, and that it wasn't safe leaving her. Over the last few weeks she'd been passed from one young man to another, with nothing she could do about it. 

'Alright, whatever,' Candy casually said. 

Candy was busy chewing gum, and preening her long blond hair. She didn't even look back at Craig, as he quickly escaped the foolish pair. 

'So, Candy, do you want a game?' Mickey nervously asked. 

'Like yea, of course. But,' she said, with a deep frown on her face. 'I'm supposed to be a good girl, so I can't play around with you,' Candy said, looking disappointed. 

'Eh? Why not?' he asked. 

'Like, no, you're not my boyfriend, so I can't play games with you,' she said. 

He still didn't get it. 'Who's your boyfriend then?' he asked. 

'Well, like, it's Craig, of course,' she told him. 

'Oh? He said you aren't his girlfriend,' Mickey shrugged. 

'Really? Like, I thought I was. Oh! Like, that's why he dumped me just now. He doesn't want me anymore,' she said, looking confused. 'Geez, that's bad. Like, I guess, that's why I've got to do as you tell me,' she said, looking confused. 

'If I'm telling you what to do, I can tell you to play,' he said. 

'Oh? I'm not sure. I can only play with a boyfriend. I've got to be a good girl, or I'll be spanked,' she groused. 

'Who'll spank you?' he asked, sounding protective. 

'Err, like, someone. If I'm naughty, and don't do as I'm told. Like, I have to do as you tell me, so, I guess it's you. Like, really, yuk. You'll spank me, if I don't do as I'm told,' she lamented. 

Mickey was as confused as much as she looked it. She looked older than him, yet she was dressed, and acted younger. He wasn't very bright, but even he could tell she was dumb. He liked the look of her, and that she didn't make fun of him. He gave her a big smile, and was about to tell her he wouldn't spank her, whatever she did. 

'Like, geez, Mickey, I don't have a boyfriend now. Would you be my boyfriend?' she asked. 

Florence knew this would happen. It seemed so terribly inevitable. The stupid bimbo was moving on to yet another boy. He sounded dim, but maybe he would treat her well, and look after her. The stupid bimbo needed keeping out of trouble. 

'Sure, that would be great. I think you're wonderful. I really want to be your boyfriend. Do you want to play a game now?' he said, nodding at the pool table. 

'Now you're my boyfriend, of course! Anything you like,' she cooed. 

She wrapped her arms around him, and gave him a deep kiss. He stumbled back in surprise. He wasn't used to girls throwing themselves at him. He'd had a girlfriend, just the one, but they hadn't gone far. She was certainly a good kisser. 

'Maybe we should play a game?' he quietly said. 

'Like, what game do you like? I like being trained. I was trained to be a cheerleader, watch!' she screeched, with excitement. 

Candy bent at the waist, and grabbed her ankles. The dress was pulled up showing off a g-string, pulled tight between her cheeks. He took a step forward, as though it were a magnet. 

She looked over her shoulder at him, and smiled. 'Like, do you think I'm good?' she asked. 

Florence remembered the young guy who pretended to train her as cheerleader, and winced. The boy took her home to train her for sex, teaching her all sorts of despicable sexual acts. She was now proficient at deep throat, which was something she hadn't even performed with her husband. Candy became addicted to orgasms so much, she'd become a dirty slut. 

This boy was eighteen, and as randy as them all. Confronted with her bare ass, he was sure to take advantage. 

'Err, that's good,' he weakly spoke. 'You'll be able to lean over the pool table really well.' 

'OK! I can do that, if that's where you want me,' she enthused, and bent over the pool table. 

'That's good,' he said, wondering what she was doing. 

He wondered why she kept showing him her bare bottom. It was nice, and worth showing off, but it made him nervous. 

She looked over her shoulder at him, with a sensuous look, though he didn't register it. He was too busy ogling her ass. 

'Do you want me to drop my panties?' she eagerly asked. 

Even Mickey caught on to what was meant. The hard-on in his trousers twitched, and grew another inch. 

'Fuck!' he said. Not meaning to be rude, it just escaped. 

'Mmm, yes, please! Candy loves fuck games. Like, Candy really loves to orgasm,' she quickly responded. 

It sounded as though she was desperate when she spoke quickly, in case he changed his mind. She pulled her panties down, and stepped out of them. She shuffled her feet apart, and looked over her shoulder. 

'Come on, Mickey! Candy wants a scrummy orgasm,' she giggled. 

On automatic he freed his cock, for it to keenly bounce up as though on alert for pussy. Mickey's hard-on pulled him into position, and nestled itself between her cheeks. She grabbed his cock, and pushed it where she wanted. She urgently pushed back, impaling herself onto his rock hard cock. She'd become such a slut over the last couple of weeks, she was more than ready for him. 

He was so scared he didn't move. She waited a short moment, then took the initiative. She ground back on him, pushing, and gyrating her hips. She lifted up on tiptoe, and leaned forward, to get his cock where it mattered most. He started to push into her, as she pushed back. His cock hit her g-spot and she let out a groan of pleasure. 

Florence's mind was flooded with sexual excitement. The pleasure centres of her mind were overcome, pushing aside all reluctance. She too was carried away on a magic carpet of lust, floating high with arousal. 

Candy soon had an orgasm. Her breathing calmed, and when she became aware, she realised he was still hard inside. 

'Oooo! Like massive! Candy wants another scrummy orgasm. Like wow!' she yelped. 

She didn't have to prompt him this time. He began to pound away at her pussy. His loins squashed her cheeks when he thrust in deep. Every time he hit deeply, she let out a little squeal of pleasure. He started to spurt inside her. Sensing it, she cum long and hard. 

Another all-embracing orgasm overcame Candy, and Florence. She lay over the pool table, with him drooping over her back. It was his first orgasm with a beautiful woman. He thought he'd just made love to a twenty year old bimbo. Instead, he'd taken, or been taken by, a mature married woman. 

Florence was far from being stupid, as she had a first class business degree. He was completely unaware that she was hypnotised to behave like a stupid, blond bimbo. It wouldn't have made much difference to either of them at that moment, while they were wrapped in the afterglow of a deeply felt orgasm. 

'Oh! Yes! Mickey, I'm your girlfriend now. Like, I belong to you after two wonderful orgasms. Candy loved having two orgasms. Like, wow!' she exclaimed, with delight. 

'Yea, you are my girlfriend, you really are,' he whispered in an ear. 

'You must tell me what you like. I love being trained. Do you think I'm a well trained, bimbo?' she innocently asked. 

'What? If that's what you want. OK, then. You are, you're a wonderful bimbo,' Mickey sincerely told her. 

'Oooo! Cool. Candy so wants to please her new boyfriend. Like, really, train me to be your perfect, bimbo, please!' she begged him. 

'Sure, just let me get my breath back,' he said. 

He grabbed his cock, to tuck it in before anyone walked in. 

'Please, sir. Like, can Candy clean up?' she asked. 

'Sure,' he said, unsure what she meant. 

She grabbed his cock, and sucked it into her mouth. He was astonished to see it disappear between luscious day-glow, pink lips. Of course he knew about a blow job, but she was licking and swallowing the remains of their sex session. The way she was juicily sucking, and licking his cock, it trembled in an attempt to rise from the dead. 

She was making a meal of it, with a big smile of enjoyment on her face. When she moaned, the vibration of her voice tickled. She gently held his balls, and played with them. From virgin to a second time, was going to be a record if she carried on. 

Letting go produced a popping sound, from the tight suction. 

She said, 'If Candy isn't doing it right, you must train Candy to be a good cock sucker. Just the way you like it.' 

Florence winced at the terrible things the stupid one was saying. It wasn't as though Candy needed training, she was already a complete slut. 

Her eyes held such innocence, and sincerity, he wanted to hold her tight and declare his love. He looked around to see if it was another of his friends tricks. They were always sending him on errands for stupid reasons. Though, if it really was a trick, he wouldn't mind in the slightest. 

'Just wait, let me get my breath back,' he told her. 

She sat back on her haunches, waiting for him to give her permission to continue. 

'Can Candy have your cock please?' she eventually asked. 

'Let's get out of here. We can go someplace more comfortable,' he said. 

'Like, yea, whatever. I've got to do what my boyfriend says, of course,' she said. 

Her lips pouted, indicating she just wanted his cock, and here would do. He straightened his clothes, and she followed him out. 

Florence was still recovering from having her mind flooded with sexual emotion. Candy didn't seem hardly effected, and always recovered quickly. Perhaps it was because Florence had simply been taken, without being consulted. She couldn't think about it too deeply, as her thoughts were in turmoil from being fucked by another stranger. 

'Are you going to buy me some clothes?' Candy asked. 

'Err, what do you want?' he asked. 

He looked her over, and figured it might be a good idea. Even to him she looked stupid in the Barbie outfit. He wouldn't be embarrassed to introduce her to friends as his girlfriend, whatever she wore. He wanted to keep her happy, so they drove to a mall. 

Florence should have been upset to be taken away by stranger, but she was still recovering from a double orgasm. Her thoughts were in limbo, letting Candy wander away with yet another eighteen year old. Not that she could do much about it, after being hypnotised as Candy for so long. The stupid bimbo was in charge, and she was merely along for the ride. 

*** 

'Oh! Like wow! This looks so cool!' Candy exclaimed. 

Mickey was embarrassed from being in a girl's clothing store. This was another first for him. She looked so sexy, he just nodded his head. Of course she could have the white pants. 

'The pink panties show,' she said. 

Of course he noticed, but didn't think it mattered. 

'Can I look for a top to go with them?' she asked. 

Her pleading look couldn't be refused. She trolled through the t-shirts and tops, until she found a plain white t-shirt. Her excitement was infectious. Again she came out of the changing room, looking ravenous. He tried to hide his hard-on, but it kept springing up. 

The store wasn't a place where his mother would shop, for she would dismiss it as being cheap. The cut off t-shirt, and stretchy pants certainly looked cheap. The t-shirt was too low cut to hide much. 

'Err, aren't you going to wear the dress?' Mickey asked. 

'Nooo! Candy wants to wear the new clothes her new boyfriend bought her,' she pouted. 

'But, don't you need to, err, wear something, err, over them,' he tried to say. 

'Like, noooo, I can't wear a pink dress over white pants,' she said. 'Please!' she whined. 

The t-shirt had a derogatory phrase written over her chest. The letters stretched across her large breasts, emphasised them, and certainly drew attention to her big tits. She solved the problem of the panty-line, by removing them. The white yoga pants were stretched thinly, over her ass, and pussy. 

'I thought you had to wear something over tights?' he asked. 

The poor guy looked mystified over the complications of women's clothing. On stage, perfectly decent women could wear hardly anything. At the beach a woman could wear a bikini, yet be upset over showing off her panties. Candy wasn't showing off her panties, yet what was usually hidden in them, was being flaunted. 

It was worse than letting the dress blow up, to reveal her bare ass in a thong. The yoga pants were thin enough to show everything. She pulled at her bottom, to dig them out of her cheeks. It just served to pull the front tighter between her lips. When she took a step or two, the stretchy material dug deeper into her crotch and bottom. 

'Nooo, like, they're not tights, they're yoga pants. Like, I can wear pants, with a t-shirt, yea?' she said. 

'OK. The t-shirt, err, the words?' he asked, sounding worried. 

Candy looked at the slogan in the mirror, with a puzzled expression. 

'It says, "Sexy Bimbo Slut",' he told her. 

'Wow, my boyfriend is soooo, clever. You read foreign! Do you think I'm a sexy bimbo slut?' she asked. 

He grinned, and couldn't help telling her, 'You're a super sexy bimbo slut.' 

She hugged him, while rubbing her nipples over his shirt. 'Candy loves her new boyfriend to bits. Like wow! Candy will do anything her boyfriend wants,' she gushed. 

She kissed him full on, and rubbed her pelvis up and down his leg. 

At the desk the assistant took her clothes to bag them. She dangled the tiny panties over the bag as though they were likely to bite, before dropping them in. She zapped the labels for the top and tights. 

'Where's the label for the panties,' she said. Looking over the edge of the counter answered her question. 'No panties,' she said, in a superior tone of voice. 

'I wondered who would buy that t-shirt. It suits you,' the girl said, with a look of disdain. 

Mickey didn't like the way she was talking to Candy. 'She's my girlfriend,' Mickey lamely said. 

The girl looked from one to the other. The self declared bimbo was older than him, though it was difficult to say by how much. The woman chewed gum and giggled, like a professional bimbo. He didn't look too bright either. 

'Thank you, I just love being a sexy bimbo slut,' Candy declared. 

'I'm sure you do,' the girl grimaced. 'Have a nice slutty day.' 

Maria thought she was a cut above the people shopping here, for the cheap tacky clothes they sold. Looking at that one, wiggling her ass toward the door, it figured she was dead right. 

Mickey liked that men were looking at his girlfriend in the mall. She was snuggling up to him, walking hip to hip toward the exit. She oozed sexuality, leaving him feeling privileged to be her boyfriend. They stopped to look at shoes in a store front, where Candy simpered over the high heels. 

In the reflection, Florence could see how lewdly she was dressed, and cringed. The stupid one was showing off her body, by wearing nothing but a push up bra, a skimpy top, and a pair of skin tight leggings. Usually, men would be staring at her breasts, whereas now, they were staring at her bottom, and a distinct camel toe. Her bottom was cleaved in two. When she walked, her butt muscles were clearly shown, wriggling around in the stretchy material.

Florence couldn't do anything about it, so retreated to a corner of her mind, leaving Candy in control of her body. How much more trouble could she get into, after all they had been through. Letting young guys molest her, and screw her, had become a normal part of her life. 

They moved on, with a promise to visit the store tomorrow. 

'Will you take me home?' Candy asked. 

'Where do you live?' Mickey asked. 

'No silly, to your place,' she giggled. 'Candy is getting horny. You paid for these clothes, so my boyfriend deserve a treat,' she coyly said. 

He could guess what she meant. His mother wouldn't be home, so he decided to risk it. Of course he would, while driven by his cock. 

Candy excitedly followed him to his bedroom, giggling and repeating the usual inane chatter. Quicker than he could undress, she peeled off the tights and t- shirt. 

'Oooo! Undo Candy's bra!' she urgently spoke. 

They were both naked, writhing on the bed. He was trying to kiss her, whereas she wanted him inside, fucking her. 

'Keep still, Mickey! Candy wants to do it sooo much,' she squealed. 

When he laid back on the bed, she clambered on top of him. Foreplay wasn't considered, or needed. She started bouncing on his hardness, with him admiring her jiggling breasts. He couldn't resist grabbing the swinging tits, to maul them. 

'Ooo! Squeeze em, Mickey. Candy loves her nipples pinched,' she yelped.

Charlotte arrived home after a hard day in the office. She hated the job, and was in a bad mood after receiving too many awkward customer complaints. 

She heard the distinct sound of a girl giggling. She marched upstairs and caught her son cavorting in bed with a girl. They quickly wrapped themselves in a sheet. The damn girl had a big happy grin on her face. They'd obviously just had sex. 

Charlotte calmed herself. It was about time her son had a relationship. He wasn't too bright, just like his father. The father had contributed his sperm, during a wild party, then thankfully left her to it. It hadn't take her long to realise it was a big mistake, and that she was best rid of the fool. 

'Hi, what's your name?' Charlotte grimaced. 

'Hi, my names Candy!' 

'Oh. Should have guessed. Get dressed, and come downstairs. I'll be in the kitchen. Mickey, you, can tidy your room,' Charlotte said. 

She was too pissed to eat, so just made a coffee. The girl eventually sauntered into the lounge, and stood there looking vacant. Charlotte looked her over wondering whether to be relieved he had a girlfriend, or feel angry it was a dim blond. 

'Well, Candy, what do you do?' she asked. 

'Err, like, nothing much. I just hang around with my boyfriend,' Candy said. 

'You mean, Mickey. How old are you?' she asked. 

It was difficult to tell how old she was. She was dressed in a pink Barbie dress, which would have suited a tasteless twelve year old. At her age it might be a retro-fashion statement, or one of those dress-up things they do. 

'Over eighteen,' Candy answered. 

Candy looked bored, but Florence was keenly interested in what this woman had to say. This looked like being the closest she'd been to escape the damnable Candy persona. 

'How old are you exactly?' she persisted. 

'Twenty-eight,' Candy said, managing to sound like a young adolescent. 

Charlotte took a good look at her. It was difficult getting past the make-up, hairstyle, clothing, and the way she acted. Maybe she was telling the truth. If so she had a mental age much younger. With such smooth skin, it was just possible to look that young. 

Looking at the girl triggered a memory. She remembered gossiping with colleagues about the bosses wife, how she had clear porcelain skin. How could she forget that boss, and his wife. She'd had too much to drink at a Christmas party, and danced too close to the boss. A week later she had been fired. One of the girls in the office told her it was the wife who engineered it. 

'Can I go and be with my boyfriend?' Candy whined. 

'Err, yes, I guess so,' she said. 

If the girl was that old, she didn't want the idiot digging her long, pink fingernails into Mickey. If she was twenty-eight, it felt creepy, the way she behaved and spoke like a teen. 

That damn boss, Mathew, told her she was going because she wasn't up to standard. He should have had the decency to give her a good reference, enabling her to get another business analyst job. The money ran out, so in desperation she tried an escort service. After a year she was running the office, which meant she didn't have to put up with dirty old men every night. 

It had been a nasty experience that she would rather forget. The cause of it she couldn't, and wouldn't. In some way she would get back at that damn man. 

She picked from a shelf the Christmas party album, given to all staff as a memento. She'd meant to throw it out, but leafed through it. He'd been a good boss, until that evening. Admittedly she had danced too close, and kissed him under the mistletoe. The wife was a stupid bitch to think anything of it. 

In a photo the bitch was posing next to him, all prissy and angel like. It looked as though she wouldn't utter a bad word against anyone. An angel, with a capacity to stab you in the back. She remembered a conversation after the kiss. The woman had smiled while asking what college her son was going to. Damn, bitch! She must have known he was a bit slow, and was rubbing in the fact. At the time she'd been too drunk to notice. Fucking bitch! 

Turning another page, she laughed at the woman dancing with a mop. She remembered the woman stroking it and flirting with it. She took a closer look at the photo. Was that his wife? The dress was the same, so of course it was. What the hell were they doing? Hypnosis, that was it. The whole night was organised to earn money for some charity. Alzheimer's or something, she couldn't remember. 

She looked at the two of them again, staring at the picture. This was the first time she'd studied the album. Turning another page, there was a photo of them together, on stage. She remembered it was a comedy act. The wife was acting like a dizzy blond, while he asked her questions. She figured it was all a set up, and they had a rehearsed an act. The bitch was good at it. 

Mickey brought his girlfriend into the lounge, looking worried. At least it delayed Charlotte from opening a bottle of wine. 

'Can Candy stay for dinner?' he asked. 

'I guess so,' she said. 

There was little enthusiasm shown, but they were excited over spending more time together. With her attention back on Candy, she figured she would have to do something about her. 

'Candy, you'd better phone your parents. Let them know you're here,' she said. 

'Err, like, I don't have parents,' she sang in high voice. 

'Who do you live with,' she asked, sounding peeved. 

'My uncle. Oh, well, like, his name is Mathew,' she said. 

The high pitched voice was annoying. Drawing information out of her was difficult. 

'What's his number. Phone number?' she clarified. 

'Don't bother your bimbo brain, I'll look it up. What's his last name? Candy, are you listening?' she cajoled her. 

No one could be this dumb. She didn't know the last name of her uncle, when she was living with him. She stared at them, happily chattering away to each other. At certain angles she looked around Mickey's age, just a bit older. 

'Candy, come with me will you. Mickey you can lay the table in the kitchen,' Charlotte said. 

She pulled the girl to the bathroom. Wash that make-up off, and I'll let you try out mine,' Charlotte told her. 

She wasn't listening to the girls silly chatter. It was easy to tune out a person, from past experiences with men. 

'So what have you been up to recently, Candy?' she asked. 

'Not much.' 

'You must have been doing something. Come on tell me,' she insisted. 

'Well, I guess, like, mostly playing games with boyfriends. Shopping with a nice lady, Mable. A nasty lady dumped me with her brother. Craig was my boyfriend, then he gave me to Mickey. I like Mickey, he's fab!' Candy enthused. 

'Tell me about your uncle,' she persisted. 

'Well, like, he's supposed to look after me. Especially when I'm, err, hypnots, err, whatever. But a boy found me and took me away. When my uncle got me back home, he let Damien take me away. My uncle turned up looking really cross, and took me back home. He sent me to my room. That's when the nasty woman, Catherine, took me to stay with her brother,' Candy said, in a rush. 

'Did your uncle hypnotise you?' she asked. 

'Err, like, maybe,' Candy said, looking confused. 'There's a voice in my head, telling me to say something,' Candy said, looking bewildered. 

'What's the voice saying?' she asked. 

'It's silly. Like, its Florence? What does that mean?' Candy asked. 

'I'm not sure,' she murmured. 

It meant something, but the what eluded her. 

Florence was frustrated as hell, from trying to get Candy to explain what happened, and hearing it scrambled in her mindless way. She desperately wanted the woman to understand and free her. It was a woman who would get her out of this hell, not some sexed up boy. 

For several weeks she'd suffered being a sex toy. She'd been forced to be a mere sexual plaything, pandering to a series of boys whims. Until this moment she thought there would be no escape, with the prospect of being nothing more than a stupid bimbo slut for the rest of her life. 

'Like, what does that mean? It's creepy,' Candy said. 

'OK. Relax, Candy. You put some make-up on, and I'll call you when dinner is ready,' she said. 

'Oh! Like goody, I like make-up,' she said, in annoying girly tones. 

Charlotte put the oven on to preheat for a pizza. She leafed through the album again, not taking much in, as she was deep in thought. There was a picture of the company owner, with his wife, Mable, and son, Damien. Mable and Damien? Was that a coincidence? 

Her uncle was Mathew, and the name Florence came up from somewhere. She frantically looked through the book, to find the photo with Mathew and his wife. The caption under it read, "Mathew Fencer and wife Florence". 

That was it, the damn woman's name was Florence! 

'Candy! Come into the kitchen!' she shouted. 

'I'm not finished with the make-up yet!' came the reply. 

Charlotte marched into her bedroom to find Candy in front of the mirror, spreading it on thick. She'd selected the brightest reds and pinks. She held her breath, unable to believe it. This girl must be Florence's niece, or some close relative. 

'Did you say you stayed with Bernard and Mable? OK. What about Damien?' she asked, while holding her breath. 

'Like, he was my boyfriend,' Candy said, while spreading her lips with dazzling pink. 

'What did you do with Damien?' she asked. 

'Well, like, we played games, of course,' Candy absently spoke, still absorbed with painting her face. 

'What kind of games?' Charlotte demanded. 

'Ooo, scrummy orgasm games,' she said, then wiped her face to start again. 

Charlotte clapped her hands. She had a close relative of that damn woman in her clutches. She had a nasty rumour to repeat about Florence's niece, to friends still working there. Could she include her son in the story? The bitch had bad mouthed Mickey, but that didn't justify doing the same to Candy. 

'Wipe that off, and we'll do it together after dinner,' Charlotte told her. 

'Alright, I guess,' Candy pouted. 

Charlotte sent Mickey to his room to clean it up. While eating pizza, Candy recounted her adventures with boyfriends. This time Charlotte was taking notice of what the girl was saying. She wanted it all very clear before phoning friends. 

'So you were dressing up for Mathew? OK. Where were you going?' she asked. 

'On vacation. We were going to play a, like, err, a game,' Candy hesitantly spoke. 

'You, uncle Mathew, and Florence?' she asked. 

'No. Just me and Mathew,' Candy said, around a mouthful. 

Charlotte looked at the photo of her boss, and Florence. She flicked her eyes between Candy, and the photo, several times. The resemblance was uncanny. Without make-up Candy looked even more like Florence. In the picture Florence was made up for the evening, and wore a ball gown. 

An incredible thought crossed her mind. It was foolish, yet she couldn't shake it off. 

'You can go and play, I mean, use my make-up, Candy,' she said. 

The girls squeals of pleasure put her off the foolish notion. more information was needed to make sense of the confused picture, so she phoned a friend. 

'Hi, Denise, how you doing,' she asked. 

'Hi, long time no gossip. Isn't it about time we went out for a meal to catch up?' Denise asked. 

'You're right, we should. I wanted to ask you about something. How old is Florence?' she asked. 

'No, let it go. What are you up to? Alright, alright, she's twenty-eight. I should know, I bought the last birthday card. You know how useless Mathew is. Are you going to tell me?' Denise cajoled her friend. 

'Not yet. I will, as soon as I work something out. By the way, does Florence have a niece?' she quietly asked. 

'Don't think so. She's an only child, with no uncles or aunts. Her parents died in a car crash some years ago. Come on, what are you up to?' Denise pleaded. 

There was no way she was going to give anything away to the company gossip, not just yet. 

'We'll meet up for coffee, only then,' she laughed. 

'A coffee, that reminds me. You remember Mable? She caught me slipping away from the office, shopping. Didn't say a thing about it. Well, she got me to look after her daughter, and I'm sure she doesn't have one, just a son. Alright, alright, I'll get to the point. The funny thing is, the so called daughter looked like Florence. It couldn't be a niece. Though she looked too old for that cos-play stuff they wear,' Denise mused. 

'Well, thanks, Denise, I've got to go, something's starting to complain in the oven,' she lied. 

She put the phone down, before her friend could start gossiping about someone else. 

All the pieces of the living jigsaw had come together. However incredulous the picture, it was plain to see. Charlotte sat brooding in an armchair, wondering what to do. Could she justify using Candy to get back at her one time boss? She could simply take her back to him, feigning outrage that the girl had slept with her son. 

The Fencer's had caused her much suffering when fired. She couldn't obtain a business analyst position, or even a temporary contract. In desperation to keep the house, she'd signed on to an agency as an escort. She found it wasn't much different from prostitution. The badly needed cash was too much of a temptation to keep her integrity. After all, she had a mortgage to pay, and a son to feed. 

Would humiliating Michael for five minutes balance out twelve months of her own degradation? He was unlikely to admit the full truth, and so avoid complete humiliation. There was also that woman, Catherine, to consider. Would he be bothered about Candy, now he had a Catherine to warm his bed? 

She grinned to herself, and poured another glass of wine. 'Shit!' she laughed. 'This is so cool. I've got the bosses wife trapped through hypnosis, as a dizzy blond. It's such a perfect retribution that she's an bimbo slut, panting for cock!' 

She sipped the cool white wine, wondering how she could use this against the woman's husband. Report_Story
