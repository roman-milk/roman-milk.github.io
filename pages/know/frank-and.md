title: Frank and Cookie

#1 

===

I met Cookie in the seventh grade. Her parents had moved to town just in time to enroll her at the start of the school year. I was walking up the steps to the west entrance of the school and I saw her by the front door. She was blocked by three guys who were making fun of her pigtails. She kept trying to get by them, but they kept moving to keep themselves between her and the door. One of the guys was Oscar Walls and he and I had gone at it a couple of times. Once on the playground at the elementary school during recess and once at the city swimming pool. Both times there were no clear winners, but both times had established that I wouldn't put up with his shit and since then we had steered clear of each other. I walked up to the little group and said: 

"You're in the way Oz. The lady and I want to go in that door." 

"You can go, but we ain't done with Miss Piggy." 

"Miss Piggy?" 

"Yeah. What else would you call a girl her age who runs around in pigtails." 

"Maybe you could ask her what her name is and call her by that. Move." 

"You going to make me?" 

I turned to the girl and asked her if she would please hold my books. I could see that she was scared, but she nodded her head "yes" and I handed them to her and turned back to Oz. 

"Yes Oz; if I have to I will." 

He sneered at me and looked at Dick Reed and Phil North and back at me and I could see that he was thinking "Three against one – a piece of cake" but when I stepped toward him Phil and Dick beat feet into the school. They didn't want any part of a fight on school grounds. 

Oz was a bully, but he wasn't stupid. He had fought me before and he knew I wouldn't quit and that it was likely that the fight would still be going on when some teacher came to see what all the commotion was about. Without Phil and Dick to help make it a quick short fight he knew we could easily end up in the principals office and with the girl telling her side of the story he could end up being expelled. I could too for that matter, but I thought that I might get points for stepping up to help the girl. Oz decided that it wasn't worth it and he turned and walked into the school. I turned to look at the girl and she was looking at me wide eyed. 

"You were really going to fight him?" 

"He's a bully and the only way you can handle a bully is stand up to him and let him know you aren't afraid of him." 

As I took my books back from her and the crowd that had gathered to see what was going on dispersed I said: 

"I don't think I've seen you here before." 

"It's my first day here. We just moved here from New York." 

"My name is Frank and let me be the first to welcome you to Hadley Middle School." 

"Pleased to meet you Frank. I'm Cookie." 

That was the start of it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Cookie and I were good friends all the way through middle school. I asked her for a date to go to the movies a couple of times, but her parents wouldn't let her date until she was sixteen. I made her promise me that I would be her first date when she reached that age and she promised. 

I was glad I had that promise because when summer vacation ended and we started the tenth grade a brand new Cookie appeared. She had spent the summer visiting relatives in New York and while she was gone she had bloomed. 

Until that time I'd pretty much had her to myself, but suddenly other guys were paying her attention. A couple of times I had to jokingly remind her that she had promised her first date to me. Her birthday was on the 10th of October and around the middle of September I asked her if her parents would allow her to date on her birthday or would she have to wait a day. She told me that it wouldn't matter because she had a restriction in that she couldn't date on school nights. She could only date on Friday, Saturday and go on a daytime date on Sunday providing she was home by seven. The 10th was on a Wednesday so I asked: 

"Will you go out with me Friday the 12th?" 

"I don't know if I can. My parents told me that they would probably set something up for the weekend since my birthday was in the middle of the week." 

"Let me know as soon as you can okay? I've been waiting almost two years to take you out on a date." 

On the 3rd of October Cookie told me that her parents had made plans for the weekend following her birthday. That meant that it would be the weekend of the 20th before we could have our date, but that was the weekend that I had to go to Chicago with my parents to celebrate my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary. I was going to have to see if I could get out of going somehow. 

There were distractions during the two weeks leading up to Cookie's birthday. We always sat together in the school cafeteria for lunch, but one day Cookie got there before I did and when I got there I found her sitting with Jason Medved. I joined them and got a nasty look from Jason. A kind of "Why the fuck are you horning in on us" look. I ignored him, but he kept butting in whenever I tried talking to Cookie and when he finally left Cook said: 

"That was pretty rude of you." 

"What was rude?" 

"Sitting down without asking if you could join us." 

"How was that rude? You and I sit together every day and everyone knows it. If any one was rude it was Jason." 

"Still, you should have asked." 

Lunch was over before it was taken any farther and nothing was said about it by either of us the next day. Two days later I got to the cafeteria and found Cookie and Jason sitting together at a table so to mollify Cookie than anything else when I walked up to the table I asked: 

"Mind if I join you?" 

"Yeah, as a matter of fact I do" snarled Jason. 

I looked over at Cookie and she just shrugged so I walked away. The next day I got there first, but when Cookie came through the line she was with Jason and when the paid the cashier she looked around and saw me and headed for my table. Jason took her by the arm and steered her to another table and she went without protest. They sat at a table not far from me and even though Cookie was sitting facing me she never once looked my way. 

That day when classes were over – for the first time in ages – I wasn't waiting outside the school to walk Cookie home. Around six the phone rang and my mom answered it and then said the call was for me. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi. Where were you after school? I waited and waited and you never showed up." 

"I figured that you would probably be with Jason so I came straight home." 

"Why would you think that?" 

"Why wouldn't I? Think about it. I've got to go" and I hung up on her. Childish of me maybe, but what the hell; I wasn't a grown up yet and I was pissed. 

The next day, even though I shared two morning classes with Cook I avoided her. I was at the cafeteria first and was at a table when Cook got there and she was alone. No Jason lurking by. She got her change from the cashier and came over to ma and said: 

"Mind if I join you?" 

"Why would I mind?" 

"After being an asshole and hanging up on me yesterday I wasn't sure that you would want me here." 

I motioned for her to sit and she put her tray down and took the chair opposite me. 

"What is wrong with you Frank?" 

"You and the way you have been these last few days." 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"The way you have been with Medved." 

"I don't know what you are talking about." 

"Sure you do. You rip me for being rude when I joined you at the table the other day when we have been sitting together since the start of high school. My place was at that table and I was not rude in taking my place. Did you say anything to Jason for the rude response I got when I followed your lead and politely asked if I could join you?" 

I could see from her face that she hadn't and I said, "I thought so. And yesterday when he steered you away from sitting with me did you protest? Did you say "I always sit with Frank" and again I could tell from her face that she hadn't. 

"I've gone through the last four years thinking that you were my girl, but I guess that I was wrong." 

"You are being silly Frank." 

"I don't think so. If you were my girl you would have let Jason know. You would have told him that you always spent lunch period with me and then invited him to join us if he wanted. You know what bothered me most about yesterday? You sat in a chair that was facing me, but not did you look my way and meet my eyes and to me that said that you knew what you were doing wasn't right, but you did it anyway." 

"Oh come on Frank; it isn't like we are going steady or anything." 

"That isn't because I don't want to Cook; it is because your parents won't let you until you are sixteen. On your sixteenth birthday I had fully intended to ask you to go steady." 

"You say that like you don't intend to any more." 

I looked at my watch. "Got to run. Can't be late for Calc." 

"You walking me home tonight?" 

"If you want me to." 

"I do." 

That afternoon when I left school I saw Cookie standing and talking to Jason and I walked up to them and stood there waiting for their conversation to end so I could leave with Cookie. Jason turned to me and said: 

"Beat it ass wipe. We're busy." 

It wasn't cool of me; not in the least, but I dropped my book bag and punched Jason in the face with everything that I had and he dropped to his knees as blood flowed from his nose. I bent down, got my face inches from his and said: 

"If you ever talk that way to me again I swear to God that I will beat the living hell out of you and you had best believe that!" 

While that was going on Cook was saying, "Jesus Frank; are you going crazy? You had no call to do that. Why are you being a jerk?" 

"I'm being a jerk? You were supposed to be waiting for me or did you forget that earlier today you asked me to walk you home after school? When I walk up this shithead calls me "Ass wipe" and tells me to beat it and I'm the jerk? I'm supposed to just smile and say "Excuse me" and leave? You remember your first day of school? I didn't put up with any crap then so why would you expect me to now?" 

I turned to leave and Cookie said, "Where are you going?" 

"Home." 

"You aren't going to walk with me?" 

"Why would you want to walk with a jerk? Tell you what. You go over there to Jason and tell him he was being a jerk when he said what he said and then we can walk home." 

She looked from me to him and then back at me, but didn't move to do it. I turned and walked away and she didn't try to catch up with me. 

Friday I again avoided Cookie during our morning classes and I was again first to the cafeteria. Cookie was with Jason when they came in and she never looked my way as she and Jason went to a table on the other side of the room. Needless to say I did not walk Cookie home from school. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

At dinner that night my dad asked me if I had any plans for Saturday and when I said no he told me not to make any. 

"Your mother and I have decided to give you your Christmas present early so tomorrow we are going to hit some used car lots and see if we can't find something suitable for you." 

I was stunned and didn't say anything and my dad went on, "It is going to cost you though. You will have to find a part time job so you can pay for your gas, oil and maintenance. I'll carry your insurance until you are eighteen, but after that you will have to pay it. Okay?" 

"Wow, yeah, sure" was all I could get out. 

The next day we found a 1965 Mustang that was in pretty decent shape. It only had a six cylinder engine in it and not the 289 that I would have liked, but maybe I could save up enough money for an engine change farther on down the line. 

I spent most of Sunday washing and waxing the car and Monday I went to the school offices and got a parking permit for it. At lunch time I was in the cafeteria when Cookie came in. She looked around, saw me, and headed for my table, but just before she got there I got up and left. That afternoon I didn't wait around for Cookie after school and I have no idea of if she even looked for me when she got out. 

When my dad got home from work he told me that the Mustang was insured so after dinner I took it out for its first spin with me behind the wheel (my dad drove it home from the car lot). I'd no sooner gotten home than the phone rang and my mom answered and then told me the call was for me. I took the phone from her and said: 

"Hello?" 

"Hi. It's me. Can we talk?" 

"Isn't that what we are doing now?" 

"No Frankie; I mean face to face." 

"Why?" 

"I don't like what is happening to us. I think we should talk about us." 

"What's happened Cook is Jason. He seems to be at the bottom of everything we argue about lately." 

"I can't help it that he is interested in me." 

"No, but you could shut him down and you aren't doing that." 

"Please Frankie; can we talk at lunch tomorrow?" 

"I suppose." 

"See you I school. Bye." 

As I hung up the phone my mom said, "You and Cookie on the outs?" 

"Sort of. Another guy is trying to cut in and she seems okay with it." 

"You are still young Frankie and you will meet a hundred more girls by the time you get out of college. I know you really like Cookie and she is the only girl you've spent time with for the last four years, but you need to know what other girls are like." 

That was true enough, but I didn't want to spend time with other girls. Cookie is the one I wanted and I'd known that since the day I met her. 

The next day I was sitting at a table when Cookie came into the cafeteria. Jason was already there too and sitting at a table on the other side of the cafeteria. As Cookie left the cashier Jason called to her and waved her over to his table, but she turned and headed for me. I had to smile at the scowl on his face. 

Cookie sat down and after the first bite of lunch she said, "What is going on between us Frankie? Why have you avoided me?" 

"I told you that last night. Jason is what is going on between us. As far as you was concerned it was rude when I sat down with you that one time, but Jason wasn't rude when he told me I couldn't join you the next time. He of course had the right, but his tone and attitude were rude as hell, but that was alright with you. You called me a jerk when I punched him, but as far as you were concerned there wasn't anything wrong with him insulting me in the first place. In every case you chose Jason over me even to the extent of ignoring me the next day and having lunch with Jason instead of me. 

"I don't own you Cook and I have no say in who you want to spend your time with, but if it isn't me don't blame me for staying away from you." 

"There is nothing going on between me Jason and me, but yes, I have spent a little time with him. You have to realize Frank that you are the only boy I've had anything to do with since I moved here. When another boy shows interest in me I want to get to know him. It is only natural. Will you walk me home tonight?" 

"No." 

I saw her face change and I said, "I don't walk home anymore. I have a car now. So I'll drive you home." 

She gave me a big smile and told me she would be waiting for me after school. She was outside waiting when I came out, but Jason was standing there with her. I transferred my book bag to my left hand to free up my right just in case Jason decided to start something like "ass wipe" again and then I walked up to them. 

"Ready to go" I asked and before Jason could say a word Cookie said, "I'm ready. Let's go' and we walked off leaving Jason standing there. 

On the rides home I told Cook that she was the first girl to get a ride in the car and she said, "And I'd better be the only one." I just smiled. 

Wednesday was Cookie's birthday and it was also a repeat of Tuesday with me and Jason both being in the cafeteria when Cookie got there. Jason again tried to get her attention, but she came over and sat with me. He was again with her when I came out at the end of the day and she again immediately left with me. 

I pulled over to the curb a block from her house and parked. I reached under the seat and brought out a gift wrapped box and a birthday card and handed them to her as I said, "Happy Birthday." She read the card and then unwrapped the present. When she opened the box she found a gold heart shaped locket on a golden chain. She put it on and then leaned over and kissed me. 

"Thank you Frank. It is beautiful." 

"You are sixteen today Cook so it is legal for me to ask you to go steady with me." 

Her face changed and she said, "I really don't want to tie myself down Frank. Now that I can date I want to spend time with other guys. My mom says that I need to meet and date different guys so I'll have a better idea of what I'm looking for when it comes time to settle down." 

"In other words no, you don't want to go steady with me." 

"I'm sorry Frank, but I really don't want to go steady with any one right now." 

I was disappointed, but I could understand what she was saying. Her mother told her the same thing that my mother told me and even though I had intended to ignore mine she wasn't going to ignore hers. 

"Okay then, but don't forget you promised me your first date. So keep the 27th open for me." 

"The 27th?" 

"Yeah. You can only date on weekends and you've already told me that you are spending this weekend with your parents. The following weekend I'll be in Chicago for my grandparent's anniversary so October 27th is the day." 

"Okay. I did promise." 

She sat with me during lunch and I drove her home On Thursday and Friday. Both times we stopped short of her house and necked a little and I went home feeling pretty good. We weren't technically 'going steady' but we did have something going. At least I thought we did until Saturday evening. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

Three of my buds and I decided to meet downtown at the arcade. We were no sooner in the door when Reed said: 

"You old dog you. Now I know why you wanted to come down here tonight." 

"What?" 

"Why didn't you tell us you were going to meet your girl here" and I looked in the direction he was looking and I saw Cookie. She was laughing and playing one of the pin ball machines. Standing right next to her and laughing along with her was Jason. So much for her promise that I would be her first date to say nothing of the fact she had lied to me about having plans to spend the weekend with her family. 

I was debating my choices – confront her or just say "Fuck it" and leave when she turned and saw me. She smiled at me and then she noticed the look on my face. I saw her lose the smile as I opted for my second choice, turned and walked away. Fortunately we had come separately so I didn't have to worry about leaving Reed, Sam, and Dan stranded. 

I almost got in trouble going home. I was so steamed that I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing until I hit a pothole and it shook the Mustang enough that I automatically looked at the gauges. I saw that I was twenty miles over the posted speed limit and I hit my brakes and slowed down to forty. Two blocks later I passed a police car parked on the other side of the road. If it hadn't been for that pot hole I would have been dead meat and my dad would have taken the Mustang away from me. I learned two lessons that night. Don't trust lying cunts and don't let your emotions control you. 

Sunday morning I was helping my dad do yard work when my mom called out that I had a phone call. I went inside and she handed me the phone. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi" Cookie said and I hung up on her and went back to helping my dad. That evening, around six, the phone rang and I answered it. "Hello?" "Please don't ha..." and I missed the rest of what Cookie was going to say because I hung up the phone. 

I avoided Cookie during our two shared morning classes and when I went to the cafeteria at lunch time I saw her sitting with Jason. I found an empty table on the other side of the room and as I sat down I saw Cookie pick up her tray and head for me. Jason tried to catch her arm and stop her, but she ignored it. She reached my table and sat down, but before she could speak I said:  

===

"What happened to your sudden concern for manners? According to your attitude lately aren't you supposed to say "Mind if I join you" or something like that? Or is it just me that has to do it when you are with Jason?" 

"What is wrong with you Frankie? Why are you behaving like you are?" 

"As if you didn't know." 

"I don't know Frankie; I don't have a clue." 

"Did you not tell me that we couldn't date on the weekend because your parents had plans for you?" 

"Yes." 

"And did you not promise me that I would get your first date when your parents started to let you date?" 

"Yes, but what has that got to do with the way you are acting?" 

"You can't possibly be that stupid Cook. I walk into the arcade and what is the first thing I see? It wasn't you and your parents. It was you and Jason. So much for your first date promise." 

I got up and walked away leaving my lunch and Cookie sitting there. When I got to the parking lot after school I found Cookie standing next to the car on the passenger's side. As I walked up she said: 

"We have to talk Frankie." 

"No we don't." 

"Okay then; I'll do the talking and all you have to do is listen. I was not on a date with Jason Saturday night. I was with my parents and if you had stuck around instead of tearing off in a snit you would have seen them. I can't help it that Jason was there. His dad and my dad work together and between the two of them they thought that it would be a great idea to get Jason and me together. I was surprised when I got to the arcade and found Jason there with his parents. It wasn't a date and I had nothing to do with it. It surprised both dads when they found out that Jason and I already knew each other. 

"Because we knew each other it was only natural that we were around each other as we played the machines. He was not a date Frankie. Now don't you feel silly for acting the way you've been?" 

"No I don't Cook. By now it should be crystal clear to you that I do not like the asshole, but every time I turn around I see you with him. You told me that you didn't want to go steady because you wanted to be able to date other guys, but the only guy I see you with is Jason. You know how pissed I was at seeing you with Jason on Saturday, but that didn't keep you from sitting with him in the cafeteria today." 

"I can't help it that he just sits down with me." 

"No? What happened to your new requirement that whoever joins you has to first ask politely if it is all right if they join you? Did he? And even if he did how hard would it have been for you to say "Sorry, but I'm waiting for Frank?" I have no right to be picking your friends for you or telling you who you can sit with, but you should be smart enough to know that if I see you with that asshole I'm not going to be coming around." 

"You aren't being fair Frankie." 

"Of course I am Cook. Life is about the choices you get to make. You know my feelings where Jason is concerned so if you choose to spend time with him you are at the same time choosing to not have me around. It is that simple." 

She was silent for a bit and then she asked, "Are you going to give me a ride home?" 

"Of course." 

As soon as we were off the school grounds she slid over next to me, took my right arm and put it around her. It was a quiet ride until we got two blocks from her house and then she told me to pull over to the curb. As soon as I shut off the motor Cookie said: 

"You are my best friend Frankie and I can bear to have you mean to me" and she kissed me. We made out for a bit and then I took her home. 

Tuesday and Wednesday we had lunch together and I drove her home. We made out both times. Thursday Cookie and I went through the cafeteria line together and took a seat at a table. We had been there about three minutes when Jason walked up and said: 

"May I join you?" 

I so wanted to tell him the same thing he had told me the time I'd attempted to join him and Cookie, but I really didn't want to deal with an upset Cookie so I just said: 

"It's up to the lady." 

Cookie already knew how I felt about Jason and it should have been crystal clear that I didn't want him there, but she said, "Of course you may" and he sat down. I was civil as we talked about the candidates running for class president and what a jerk Mr. Ames our Civics teacher was. When lunch period ended and we stood to leave Jason said, "Call you tonight?" and I saw Cookie throw a quick glance at me as she nodded her head yes. 

That nod and quick glance bothered me all afternoon, but I didn't say anything as I drove Cookie home. She gave me a look when I drove past our make out spot without stopping, but she didn't say anything. I dropped her at her house and said I'd call her as soon as I got back from Chicago. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

I didn't go to school on Friday because we had to be at the airport at two for our flight. As we were getting ready to leave the house we got a phone call that grandma had suffered at stroke and was in the hospital and the anniversary party had been cancelled. Mom decided that she still needed to go so dad drove her to the airport. 

It was probably a little cold hearted of me since I did love my "Grams" but I thought that now I can call Cookie and we can have our date. I was going to call her as soon as she got out of school, but dad came home from the airport and had me help him do some things so it was just a bit after six before I could get on the phone. I called and the phone was answered by her mom. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi Mrs. Thacker, its Frankie." 

"Oh hi Frankie. Are you in Chicago all ready? I thought you didn't leave until three." 

"We didn't go. My grandma had a stroke and the party was called off so I'm still here. May I speak to Cookie?" 

"She isn't here Frankie; she and Jason just left." 

"Oh? Do you know when she will be back?" 

"I've no idea Frankie. Her curfew is eleven and being that this is her first date I'd bet that she won't be home until one minute to eleven." 

"Please tell her that I called." 

"I will and Frankie? I'm sorry about your grandmother." 

"Thank Mrs. Thacker." 

I hung up the phone. So I was Cookie's best friend and she couldn't bear to have me mad at her? Well I guess she was just going to have to learn how to bear it. 

++++++++++++++++ 

Apparently her mom gave her my message because she called me at noon the next day. As son as I heard her voice I hung up the phone. She called twice more on Saturday and three times on Sunday and each time I hung up as soon as I heard her voice. 

Monday I wouldn't even look at her during our morning classes and when she tried to catch me between classes I literally ran from her. I didn't go to the cafeteria at lunch time and instead I sat in my car out in the parking lot. After my last class I ran for my car so I could avoid having Cookie standing there waiting for me, but it did no good. She was there when I got there. As I walked up she said: 

"Why are you being so mean Frankie? Talk to me." 

"Why? So you can tell me more of your damn lies?" 

I unlocked the car door and as I was getting in she said, "Please Frankie, don't be tha...." and I think I shocked the both of us when I snarled: 

"Just shut the fuck up! I don't want to hear another word out of your goddamned lying mouth." 

Her face went pale at my outburst since I had never, in all the time I'd known her, used profanity in her presence. I started the car and drove off leaving her standing there. 

From that day forward whenever I saw Cookie she was with Jason and it was only one week after my blow up that I heard that Cookie and Jason were going steady. I chalked it up as another lie she'd told me. 

Several times over the rest of the school year Cookie tried to talk tome, but I hung up when she phoned or walked away if she came up to me. She sent me a card on my eighteenth birthday, but I threw it away unopened. 

I did get some childish satisfaction out of the situation. 

I ran across Jason in the park where I went to run in the mornings. He unwisely sneered at me and told me that I was a loser who couldn't even hang onto to his girl. I told him I was well rid of the lying cunt. 

"You can't call my girl that." 

"I just did asshole. Want to hear it again? You're welcome to the lying cunt." 

He swung at me and I beat the snot out of him. It was seen by a couple of kids from the school, but they hadn't heard what had been said and had assumed that I'd busted his ass because he had stolen Cookie from me. The word went around that you shouldn't mention Cookie or Jason around me. 

+++++++++++++++ 

With Cookie out of my life I looked around and noticed a bunch of girls that I wouldn't mind dating. Getting dates was easy since I was one of the few guys in our class that had a car and I rarely had a weekend that I didn't have something going. My part time job at Burger Barn did get in the way some, but I did have to work to earn the money that kept the car going. 

The thing was that every time I took my date somewhere Cookie and Jason would be there or would get there shortly after we got there. Jason made sure to keep the width of the room between us and Cookie would have a look on her face that fairly screamed out "What are you doing with HER?" It almost seemed like she was jealous. 

By the middle of the eleventh grade I had settled into a steady relationship with Pauline French and every time Pauline and I ran across Jason and Cookie Pauline would get nasty looks from Cookie. I thought it was funny. Pauline said it was because Cookie wanted me and I had to laugh at that. 

"She had me and she dropped me for the asshole she is with." 

"I think she regrets it." 

"Tough shit. She made promises and she broke them and she lied to me." 

Pauline shrugged and said, "Her loss and my gain." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Just before Christmas I got some good news. Jason's dad got transferred and Jason ended up having to move. It was good news to me not because it meant that Cookie was now free to date, but because it meant that with all of the holiday activities coming up her steady boyfriend was gone. She could probably scare up some dates, but it wouldn't be the same. 

The day after Christmas I ran into Cookie's mom at Wal-Mart and she asked me why I never came around any more. 

"You and Cook were always so close and then overnight you were gone." 

"Unfortunately she made me a promise and then broke it and then to add insult to injury she lied to me and that ended it for us." 

"She did what?" 

I told her the story and she looked shocked. "My Cookie did that? 

"Yes she did." 

"I'm so sorry Frankie; I thought I'd raised her better than that." 

The next day when I got home from my shift at the Burger Barn I found Cookie sitting on the front porch steps. As I came up the walk she said: 

"Why did tell my mother what you did?" 

"Because she asked me why I didn't come around anymore and since I'm not a liar like some people I know I told her. What's the matter? You don't like people knowing that you are a lying bitch?" 

"When did I lie to you?" 

"The day I asked you to go steady was one of them. You told me that you weren't going to go steady because your mother wanted you to date other guys to see what they would be like and yet not two weeks after telling me that you were going steady with Jason. 

"I guess another lie was your promise to me that I would be your first date. You knew you were going to go out with Jason when I was supposed to be in Chicago. You think I didn't catch it when he said "Call you tonight" and you nodded your head yes when we had lunch that last day? You had already set it up and to hell with your promise to me. So fuck you Miss Thacker; just keep your lying ass away from me" and I walked by her and into the house. 

Ten minutes later my mom came into my room. "Why is Cookie sitting on the front steps crying?" 

"Don't know and I don't care." 

"No Frankie; that won't do. It obviously has something to do with you so what is it?" 

I explained it to my mom the same as I had explained it to Cookie's mom and then my mom said: 

"You go out there and apologize Frankie. She was wrong, but she is still a young teenager and still hasn't grown up and learned how to handle life. You are the same. You need to learn that life isn't always fair and people make mistakes. You have to learn to deal with those mistakes without anger dictating what you do. You and Cookie have been friends way too long for you to treat her the way you have." 

"But she lied to me. She broke her promise." 

"Just because you feel that strongly about her doesn't mean that she has the same strong feelings for you. You have to accept that she may only have ever viewed you as a friend and not a boyfriend. It happens to all of us Frankie. When I was in high school I fell madly in love half a dozen times and none of them lasted. I went through a dozen boyfriends before I met your father. You and Cookie had a great friendship. Too great of a friendship to let it be ruined by a case of puppy love. Now go out there and mend some fences." 

I got up and went downstairs and out onto the porch, but Cookie was gone. I spent the rest of the week thinking about what my mother had said. During the same period I attended a couple of holiday parties with Pauline and we never ran across Cookie. 

One party brought about a milestone in my life. The loss of my virginity. Pauline's eighteenth birthday was on December thirty-first and as we danced at a New Year's Eve party she whispered in my ear: 

"When we leave here tonight we are going to usher the New Year in in style. Can you afford a motel room?" 

It just so happened that I could. 

We were both virgins, but some things come natural to you. There was a lot of foreplay before we settled into the missionary position and I do have to say that even though my first time was embarrassingly quick it was still wonderful. The second time took a little longer and the third time seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end. 

Pauline said she wanted to see what having her pussy eaten would be like so I got down there and went after it. I had no clue as to what to do, but Pauline directed me. If it felt good she said to keep on doing it and if I did something that didn't feel right she told me. After a while she pushed me away and said that it was my turn. She had never given a blow job and I'd never had one so it was more uncharted territory for us. It was great except for at one point she used her teeth and got an "Ouch" from me and after that she was careful not to use teeth. I loved being in her mouth and I told her she could do it to me any time she wanted and she told me that I could munch on her beaver any time I wanted to. 

By six in the morning we had made love four times and done oral on each other twice. I left that motel one very happy camper. 

After that night Pauline and I managed to do it on the average of three times a week and it would have been more if it wasn't for my job at the Burger Barn or her job at the Dairy Queen. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The first day of school following the holiday break I entered the cafeteria at lunch time and I spotted Cookie sitting alone. I walked over and sat down. She looked up and started to say something, but I cut her off. 

"No, I'm not going to ask if I may join you. I'm only here long enough to ask you if you would like a ride home from school. We need to clear the air between us. If you are at the car when I get out of class I'll know you want to talk. Now if you will excuse me Pauline is waiting for me." 

I got up and went over to sit with Pauline who quite naturally wanted to know what I'd been doing at Cookie's table. I told her and she asked: 

"Am I going to end up having to fight for you?" 

"Not hardly. You have me for as long as you want me." 

"Good." 

Pauline's last class ended an hour before mine and she was supposed to spend the last hour of the school day in study hall, but she usually skipped it and went in early for her shift at the DQ so I didn't have to worry about her and Cookie together at the car although I did kind of wonder at how that would have gone. 

Cookie was waiting at the car when I got there. As we pulled out of the parking lot I just flat out asked Cookie why she had done to me what she did and she told me that she hadn't meant to do it. 

"I didn't lie to you when I told you I wasn't ready to go steady. I meant it at the time and if it wasn't for Jason I would have dated other guys, but when I met Jason I felt a spark and it just went from there." 

"And your promise to me?" 

"I'm really sorry about that Frankie, but I was between a rock and a hard place. Jason was my guy and he wanted my first date. I know it wasn't honest of me, but I thought with you being out of town I could go out with Jason and you would never know and then I could go out with you when you came back and you would have thought I'd kept my promise. I know it wasn't right Frankie, but I felt that strongly about Jason. I never meant to hurt you Frankie; honest to God I never meant to hurt you. You have been my best friend forever and it has been killing me that you won't have anything to do with me." 

I was silent for a bit and then I said, "You have never seen me as a boyfriend have you?" 

"No Frankie I didn't. I suppose that if Jason hadn't come along or I'd never felt that spark with anyone else I dated that you and I would probably have ended up a couple, but I don't really know." 

I told her what my mother had said "And I guess she was right. We have been friends forever and I guess I can't hold it against you that you didn't have the feelings for me that I had for you." 

"Does this mean that we can be friends again?" 

"Yes, I guess it does" I said as I pulled up in front of her house. She slid over next to me and gave me a hug and a kiss and said, "Thank you Frankie, thank you." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The rest of our senior year slid by and I saw Cookie often and gave her rides home from school on days when Pauline skipped study hall and went into work early. Pauline and I even double dated a time or two with Cookie and whoever her boyfriend of the moment was. 

One day, a month before graduation, Pauline asked, "You going to try and get something going with Cookie when I leave for college?" 

"You tossing me back into the dating pool?" 

"Just being realistic Frankie. I'm going to be fifteen hundred miles away and I probably won't come home except on holiday breaks and summer vacations." 

"No problem babe; I can wait." 

"Maybe you can sweetie, but I won't. I'll date when I'm there and if the right guy comes along I'll probably give it up. Face it sweetie; I like it too much to go without. If you are unattached when I do come home we can get together. When I graduate and come home maybe we can pick up where we leave off. The thing is I don't want you sitting here waiting faithfully for me. Date, have a good time and try to get laid because that is pretty much what I'll be doing." 

That was a bit of a blow because I thought Pauline and I had a bit more going for us than it seemed. Pauline knew I was disappointed and she did her best to bring my spirits up by fucking me half to death until she left for school. 

+++++++++++++++ 

Cookie and I were staying at home and attending the local community college with the idea of transferring to a four year school down the line. We shared some of the introductory classes like Introduction to Computers and English Composition 101, but we had different majors so we didn't have all that many classes together. We did see each other almost every day at school and occasionally we found ourselves in the school cafeteria at lunch time and when that happened we sat together. 

For the first few months I was in a bit of a funk knowing what Pauline was probably doing while she was at school, but I eventually shook it off and started dating. It was easier now that I was working part time at my Uncle Mike's Just Brakes franchise and didn't have to work evening anymore. The money was better too.  

===

I felt a little guilty the first time I took one of my dates to bed. It was like I was cheating on Pauline, but it didn't take me long to reason it out. Pauline had no doubt started within a month of getting to school so I really wasn't being unfaithful to her but still, the first couple of times I didn't feel right about it. 

When I did start dating I would occasionally run across Cookie and her date of the evening and I noticed that she was never with the same guy twice. I chalked it up to her still pining away for Jason and not being able to come up with a guy who gave her the same feelings he did. 

I did hook up with a couple of girls that I had short term relationships with, but no one who even came close enough for me to consider a long term relationship with. 

Pauline did come home for the holidays and she called me the day she got home and I guess you could say that we picked up where we left off. Our first evening together was supposed to be dinner and a movie, but as soon as she got in the car she slid over next to me and reached for my zipper as she said: 

"To hell with dinner baby. Take me somewhere and fuck my socks off." 

That set the pattern for the next week, but even though I was loving all the sex something didn't feel right. Something was different. I'm not the swiftest guy in the world, but I finally figured it out. The day after Christmas as we were showering after a sex filled five hours in room 127 of the Marlowe Ave Motel 6 I said: 

"You found someone at school didn't you? Someone special?" 

She looked away from me and said, "Yes." 

"Then why aren't you with him right now instead of being here with me?" 

She was silent for a few seconds and then she said, "Because I promised you that if you were unattached when I came home we would get together and I know how you feel about promises. Besides, I always keep my promises." 

"That's dumb Pauline. You didn't promise me anything. As I remember it all you said was that if I didn't have anything going we could get together. That wasn't a promise. If you have strong feelings for the guy you need to get the hell out of here and spend the rest of the holidays with him." 

"You don't want me any more?" 

"Of course I want you, but the important thing here is that you don't really want me. You want him. You need to understand that I stopped thinking of us having a life together when you told me what you would be doing while you were away. All we are now Pauline is friends with benefits. I'll take it as long as you want to give it to me, but if you have found a guy that you feel strongly about you need to be with him." 

She called me that evening and told me she had called him and he had invited her to come and stay with him. 

"I'm going honey, but I'm always going to have a place in my heart for you." 

I wished her well and then I thought about how I had managed to screw myself up. Pauline was gone and so was my date for the New Year's Eve party at Jeff's. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I was having lunch at Denny's when Cookie walked in. The place was full so I waved her over to join me. We chatted while we ate and Jeff's party came up in the conversation. I mentioned that since Pauline and I had broken up I wouldn't be going. 

"Why not?" 

"Because those kinds of parties are couples affairs and singles don't really fit in." 

"What you are saying is that you would be going if you had a date." 

"Pretty much, but this close to the party finding a date would be near impossible. I have what? Seven hours to come up with a date?" 

"No problem. What time do you want to pick me up?" 

"Pick you up?" 

"I don't have a date and I was going to go to the party and I was going to go single. You said you would go if you had a date so what time do you want me ready?" 

It was the first time I had ever danced with Cookie and I was surprised at how well she fit into my arms and how easy we moved together. We had a good time, but the biggest surprise came when the count down to midnight began. I expected a quick peck on the lips to honor the tradition, but on the stroke of midnight Cookie grabbed the back of my head and gave me a kiss that left me weak in the knees. When we broke the kiss I looked at her in astonishment and she said: 

"We'll talk later on the way home." 

The party broke up at three and as I pulled away from the curb Cookie said: 

"You have always been my best friend Frankie. We have always been close. Close enough that I can ask you for a big favor. A really, really big favor." 

"What?" 

"Will you make love to me tonight?" 

I couldn't have been anymore stunned if she asked me to help her rob a bank. I sat there with both hands on the wheel staring forward at the road we were travelling. I couldn't think of a thing to say. 

"What's wrong Frankie? Why won't you talk to me?" 

"You caught me by surprise Cook. I don't know what to say." 

"Just say yes Frankie. Please?" 

"What is going on here Cook?" 

"I like sex Frankie. Actually I love it, but I haven't been laid since Jason left. I've dated a lot, but I never liked any of them enough to do more than some heavy make out sessions. You're my best friend Frankie. Help me out please?" 

It was unreal. For years I had thought of her as 'my girl' only to find out that she didn't have the same feelings for me. Now, after I'd adjusted to being just her friend in a big brotherly sort of way, she was offering me her body. Part of me wanted to say no just out of spite, but even as I had that thought the larger part of me was saying, "You have always wanted her so you damned well better say yes." 

I had a few bucks in my pocket so hung a left on Mayhew and headed for motel row on the outskirts of town. Cookie was taking off her clothes before I even had the door closed. I thought Pauline was hot, but Cookie made Pauline look like a total beginner. Cookie had said that she loved sex and she spent all night proving it. She did it all. She even wanted anal which was something that I had never done before. She had my cock in her mouth trying in vain to get me up again when I drifted off to sleep. 

And that was the start of it. 

As we drove away from the motel in the morning Cook said, "I have a family thing to do tonight, but I'm free tomorrow. From then on it was sex two or three times a week. We had making love for over a month before we went out on an actual date. By the middle of the year we were considered a couple and by the time the next New Year's Eve party I was thinking of buying a ring and proposing. As it turned out I never did get to actually propose. 

It was on New Year's Day – one year to the day since our first time – when she hit me with it. 

"We have a problem Frankie." 

"What?" 

"I'm pregnant." 

"How? I mean I know how, but I thought you were on the pill." 

"I am, but remember that cold I had back in November? The antibiotics I took messed up my system and apparently negated the birth control pills. What are we going to do?" 

"We have to get married." 

"How can we do that? We can't afford it." 

"I'll have to quit school and go full time at Uncle Mike's. We can make it. Others have done it on less." 

"God Frankie, what am I going to tell my parents?" 

"The truth Cook. It isn't something you can hide, at least not for more than a couple of months." 

"I didn't want this Frankie. God knows I didn't want this." 

"But we got it Cook and now we have to live with it." 

Our parents took it surprisingly well. My parents surprised me with something that I had never known. They had gotten married for the same reason I was marrying Cookie. My dad did say: 

"This is one case where I wish it wasn't a "like father, like son" situation, but what is is." 

According to Cookie her dad just shrugged when he got the news and her mother told her that she felt guilty over not warning Cookie about the effects that some medications had on birth control pills. 

The ceremony was a civil one with just a few friends and family in attendance. Our parents got together and for a wedding present they paid for a one year lease on an apartment and gave us enough furniture for it. I went full time for Uncle Mike and we settled into married life. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Being pregnant seemed to make Cookie horny all the time and since we now lived together instead of just dating our sex life moved up from two or three times a week to five and six and that frequency held right up to two weeks before Frank junior arrived on the scene. When JR, which is what we called Franklin Michael Malone junior, was six months old Cookie's mom took over as babysitter and Cookie found a job as a secretary at a real estate office and we started saving money for a down payment on a house. 

A couple of years went by and we were finally able to come up with the down payment on a house we could afford and we moved in. The only other thing of note (as related to my life anyway) was that we were invited to Pauline's wedding and then I got to be her wingman/babysitter when she went out and got drunk following her divorce when she caught him cheating. We stayed good friends and surprisingly Cookie showed no jealousy over the fact that I was so close to an ex-girlfriend. 

Pauline had gotten a real estate license and was working for the same agency that Cookie worked for and Pauline was helping Cookie study for taking the licensing exam so Cook could get her license. 

Cook and I had been married a little over five years when life got complicated. Uncle Mike bought a Jiffy Lube franchise and since it was taking up a lot of his time he made me the manager of the brake franchise. After six months he decided that he really couldn't handle them both so he made me an offer. He would lease the brake franchise to me with an option to buy and the lease payments would go toward the purchase. For me it was a no brainer and I jumped at it. 

The thing that I hadn't noticed while working for Uncle Mike was the amount of time he had to spend on the business and my hours became longer. I had to get there early to open, stay late to close and then take care of the paperwork generated during the day. Some nights I was there two or three hours after closing just taking care of the payroll, filing tax reports for city, county, state and the federal government. Just making sure payroll taxes got paid on time and were accurate took a chunk of time. 

About the same time I noticed a change in Cookie. She would go through periods of being happy and then sad. She would get 'snappish' with me and then a day later she would apologize. I put it down to the pressure of being a fulltime secretary and trying to be more than a part time mom with out me being there to help as much as I had before I took over the brake shop. It went on for over three months before I found out what was happening. 

Pauline had brought her car in for some brake work and while she was waiting we decided to go to lunch. We talked as we ate and we were almost finished when Pauline asked how things were going with me and Cookie. 

"Great. Why do you ask?" 

"Just curious. I know how hung up she used to be on Jason. I just wondered if it had any effect on your marriage." 

"Why should it?" 

I saw a funny look come over her face and she said, "No reason. No reason at all." 

"Don't give me that sweetie; I know you too well. You have something that you just decided to keep from me. What is it?" 

"I just wondered how the two of you were getting along now that she is seeing Jason." 

"Cookie is seeing Jason? I didn't even know he was back in town." 

"He isn't. The company he works for has an office here and he comes to town for a couple of days every two or three weeks. When he is here he calls her and they have lunch." 

"That's it? They have lunch together?" 

"I don't know what she does when she is gone, but some of those lunches are pretty long ones. You really didn't know she was seeing him?" 

"Didn't have a clue." 

"I hope I didn't just make problems for you." 

"I hope you didn't either, but things aren't sounding too good. How long has it been going on?" 

"Two or three months." 

"Two or three months and Cookie has never mentioned him at all during that time? No sweetie; things are definitely not sounding good." 

I asked Pauline to call me the next time Jason was going to be in town and she said that she would. 

That afternoon as I sat in the office reviewing the time sheets it occurred to me that Cookie's mood swings could be because she was seeing Jason. Her 'happy' periods were when he was in town and her 'down' periods and irritable times were between his visits. I never would have thought that Cookie would cheat on me, but what else could her failure to tell me about Jason's visits mean? If they were just innocent lunch dates with an old friend why would she hide them from me? And of course the big question – what was I going to do about it? 

It was two weeks before I got the call from Pauline, but I really didn't need it. I got home from work to find a very happy Cookie and I guessed that it meant she had either seen Jason that day or had at least gotten a call from him telling her that he was coming to town. 

Pauline verified it the next day when she called me at work. 

"I was out showing a house and I didn't know Jason was here until I got back to the office. I got there just as Jason dropped her off. Then I had a couple come in about a house and I forgot to call you until this morning." 

"What time does Cook usually leave for lunch?" 

"Between eleven-thirty and twelve." 

"Thanks for the call sweetie. I owe you one." 

"Careful lover; I just might call in the debt." 

I laughed and said goodbye. I couldn't afford a private detective so it was going to have to be a 'do it yourself' thing. I called Harry into the office and told him he was in charge until I got back and then I headed for the real estate office. At eleven-fifteen I was parked just up the street where I could see the front and side door and parking lot and I settled in to wait. 

At eleven-thirty Cookie came out the front door, looked both ways and then moved up to the curb and stood there. A minute or so later a Ford Focus pulled up and Cookie got in. She slid over and kissed the driver and the car pulled away. I followed along behind them and pulled to the curb and parked when they pulled into the parking lot at Antonio's. It was Jason who got out on the driver's side and he and Cookie entered the restaurant hand in hand. Forty minutes later they came out, got in the car and then sat and necked for about twenty minutes and then he drove her back to work. 

That night Cookie was in a great mood which of course did not put me in a good mood. One of the things about Cookie's good moods was that she never – NEVER – wanted to make love when she was in one. She always had an excuse why she couldn't on that night, but she always did promise to make it up to me and she usually did. I guess she thought she would be cheating on Jason if she had sex with me when he was in town. Either that or she couldn't stand to have me touch her after she'd spent time with him. 

I slept fitfully that night as I spent some time wondering about the situation and what I ought to do. My restless night was apparently noticeable as Cookie mentioned it in the morning. 

"You didn't seem to sleep well last night. Something bothering you?" 

"Yeah, I guess there is." 

"Any thing I can help you with?" 

I couldn't have asked for a better opening, but I didn't take it. I wanted to know more about her meetings with Jason before I confronted her. At eleven- twenty I was again parked where I could watch the real estate office. Cook came out at eleven-thirty on the dot and less than a minute later Jason pulled up and she got in the car and she leaned over and kissed him. I followed them to a Denny's and the entire thing was a repeat of the day before only this time they necked for over a half hour before Jason drove her back to work. 

I went back to work and again spent the afternoon thinking about what was going on. They didn't appear to be having sex, but they could have been. I'd only followed them for two days and they had been meeting for three months and who knows what they did on all the times I never knew about. She was always home when I got there so unless it was on nights I stayed late to do paperwork they weren't meeting after Cook got off work. I remembered what Pauline said about the fact that some of their lunch meetings being long ones. I needed to know more before I got on her about it. 

I loved the dumb bitch and I was happy with my marriage and my family and if I didn't handle it right I could screw things up pretty bad. If things weren't all ready too bad. I mean why was she seeing him? What did they talk about? Was she thinking of leaving me for him? Was my marriage all ready in the toilet and I just didn't know it yet? I'd just about made up my mind to let things ride and wait and see what she did the next day or maybe on Jason's next trip when Cookie brought things to a head. 

She was in another of her happy moods and over dinner she told me that she would be late the next evening. 

"I'm stopping after work with the girls from the office for a girl's night out. I won't be too late, but you will have to handle dinner for you and JR." 

A little bell rang in the back of my head. Cookie had never before stopped after work with the girls from the office. While Cookie was doing the dishes I went into the bedroom that I had turned into a home office and den and I called Pauline and asked her about the planned girl's night out. 

"What girl's night out? I don't know anything about it." 

I told her about what Cookie had told me and Pauline said, "The girls have never stopped for drinks after work and if they were going to start I'd be one of the fist ones to know. In fact I tried to arrange one a couple of months ago and no one was interested." 

There was a slight pause and then "Oh shit! Jason's in town." 

"Exactly." 

"What are you going to do?" 

"I don't know yet, but I could very well end up divorced." 

"Oh goodie!" 

"Oh goodie?" 

"Divorced puts you back in circulation. I fucked up once and let you get away and I've regretted it ever since. I'd love another shot." 

As I hung up the phone I was already thinking of how I was going to handle it. 

When we went to bed Cookie wanted to play and I had to wonder about that. She usually wouldn't have anything to do with me on the days she spent with Jason, but she was going to fuck me and then go to him the next day? I didn't understand it, but understand it or not Cookie was offering and it could very well be the last time for us so I was going to take it. It was an exhausting night as we made love three times and as I drifted off to sleep I wondered if we would be sharing the same bed after the next day. 

Over breakfast the next day Cookie reminded me of her girl's night out and that she would be late. 

"Just make sure in your mind that your night out is worth the price you will have to pay for it." 

"What on earth do you mean by that?" 

"What I mean is that your husband is not the dumb clueless doofus you apparently think he is. I know a lot more about things than you think I do so like I just said, make sure that your girls night out is worth the price that you will pay for it." 

"I don't have a clue as to what you are talking about." 

"You have all day to think about it. Maybe by quitting time you will have figured it out. Then again maybe you have all ready figured it out and you are willing to pay the price." I got up as I said, "Got to get going or I'll be late in opening the shop. See you tonight. Or not." 

I left the house to Cookie's "Come back here Frank! You can't just..." and the closing door cut off the rest.  

===

I was just up the street from her office when she came out at lunch time. She got in her car and drove to the Burger King and went through the drive thru and then drove back to her office. 

I went back to work and spent most of the afternoon wondering about how the evening was going to go. I'd made up my mind that if Cookie went on her girl's night out we were done. She would come home and find all of her things in the spare bedroom; the bedroom that was supposed to be for our next child. The one we wouldn't be having. 

I let everyone go and closed the shop a half hour early and drove over to the mother-in-laws to pick up JR and then drove home. Cookie wasn't there, but I hadn't expected her to be since I was home early. If she did come straight home she wouldn't get there for another half hour. I parked JR in front of the TV to watch Sponge Bob Square Pants while I started dinner. I worked with one eye on the clock and when Cookie wasn't home a half hour after her usual time I fed JR and then started moving Cookie's things out of our bedroom and into the spare bedroom. 

I was carrying an arm full of dresses out of our bedroom when Cookie came up the stairs and saw me. I hadn't heard her come in the house. She saw that my hands were full of her clothes and she asked: 

"What are you doing Frank?" 

"Moving you out of our bedroom" I said as I walked across the hall and dropped the dresses on the bed. "Since you are home now I'll let you hang them up while I finish moving the rest of your stuff." 

"What is wrong with you Frank? Are you out of your mind? First there was all that nonsense this morning and now this?" 

I looked at my watch and saw that it was five after nine so I said, "You got off work four hours ago Cook; where have you been?" 

"I told you that I was stopping after work with the girls." 

"And I told you to make sure that you were willing to pay the price if you went. The price is the end of our marriage. You will be staying in the spare bedroom until I can work out the finances for one of us moving out and into an apartment. I'll be seeing an attorney in the next day or so and get the divorce paperwork started." 

"Are you fucking insane?!!! A divorce over me stopping for drinks after work?" 

"Come off of it Cook. I told you this morning that I knew a lot more than you thought I did. I know about your seeing Jason for the last six months (Pauline said two or three but I was going for shock value) and I know for a fact that there was no girl's night out tonight with the girls who work in your office. What you did tonight was meet Jason after work and I can guess what you did with him for four hours. Face it Cook; you are busted. 

"I gave you a chance to hang on to your marriage this morning when I said what I said. You should have been smart enough to figure out that I knew what was going on from the things I said. It isn't all bad though. In six months or so you will be free and you and Jason won't have to sneak around. Hell, now that you are busted and we are through you don't have to wait six months. In fact, why don't you go call the asshole and tell him to come pick you up? You can spend the night with him and not have to sleep in the spare bedroom. But I will tell you one thing. If he ever sets foot in this house I won't be responsible for what I do to the both of you." 

I left her standing there as I went back to what used to be our bedroom for another load of her stuff. When I got back to the spare bedroom she was sitting on the bed and she looked up as I came into the room. 

"We have to talk about this Frank." 

"The time for talking is long past Cookie. The time to talk was six months ago. It should have started with a "Guess who is back in town" but I never got that did I? Instead you have been seeing him behind my back. No matter. It is over now so you just go and do whatever." 

I went downstairs and pulled JR away from the electronic babysitter and told him it was time to get ready for bed. Cookie was still sitting on the bed in the spare room when we walked by it on the way to JR's room. 

"Why is mommy crying?" 

"She got some bad news tonight and I guess it has upset her." 

I got him put down for the night and headed back to my bedroom. Cookie had moved from the spare room into what had been our bedroom and was sitting on the bed. She looked up as I came into the room. 

"We have to talk Frank. I didn't do anything wrong. It isn't what you think. You have to listen to me." 

"Why should I listen to you Cook? All you are going to do is lie to me." 

"No I won't. Honest Frank; I didn't do anything wrong." 

"See Cook? There's your first lie right there." 

"No it isn't Frank. All I've done is have lunch with Jason a couple of times and I had dinner with him tonight. I never told you about Jason coming back to town because I knew how much you disliked him. I wanted to see him, but I didn't want to cause problems between you and me so I didn't say anything. Okay, so maybe it was wrong of me to do that, bur Jason and I haven't done anything wrong. I swear to you Frank, nothing happened between us. I haven't done anything wrong." 

"No? Well all I can say is that your definition of wrong is a lot different than mine. To me a wife kissing another man is wrong. To me a wife making out with another man is wrong. To me a wife lying to her husband is wrong and you have done all of those things Cook. And those are just the things I know about. God only knows what you have done that I don't know about." 

"But I...." 

"Get off of it Cook. I told you that I know more than you think I know." 

I decided to keep Pauline out of it because I might need her to play spy again so I said, "I was in town at the bank seeing about a larger line of credit and I decided to stop by your office and take you to lunch. I got there just in time to see you get in a car with Jason and slide over next to him and kiss him. It was on the mouth Cook; not a good friend peck on the cheek, but on the mouth and you didn't break it off in any hurry either. I followed you to Antonio's and I was watching when you came out, got in the car and made out like a couple of teenagers for the next half hour. I didn't see what your hands were doing below window level, but I have a pretty good imagination. 

"Being the curious guy that I am I was back yesterday to see what you might be up to and I'm sure that you can remember just what I got to see and after seeing that I'm pretty sure you can figure out what I think you did tonight. All of that adds up to "wrong" in my book Cookie. You can say you did nothing wrong until you are blue in the face, but again, what you consider wrong and what I consider wrong have nothing in common so if you don't mind get on over to your room because I need to get to bed." 

"This is my room too. I belong in here with you." 

"I don't see it that way. I don't want to touch you or have you touch me after what you have been doing with Jason." 

"Bullshit Frank. You made love to me last night after seeing me with Jason at lunch." 

"True, but all you did was neck at lunch. I suspect that you did a lot more than that tonight." 

"Damn it Frank; I told you that it was just dinner." 

"True Cook, that is what you told me, but I don't trust you anymore so I am not going to waste any of my time believing anything that you say. Now lave the room so I can go to bed." 

"No Frank, this is my room too and I'm staying." 

I grabbed her, picked her up and carried her across the hall to the spare bedroom and tossed her on the bed. I went back to my room and pushed the dresser over to block the door and then I went to bed and tried to fall asleep. It was hard to do until Cookie stopped beating on the door demanding to be let in. Eventually she did stop and I fell asleep. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

In the morning she was sitting at the table in the kitchen when I came down. She looked like she had been crying all night. JR was sitting there eating his cereal so nothing was said between me and Cookie regarding our new circumstances. I poured myself a cup of coffee and toasted a bagel and then sat down and talked with JR about what he would be doing in school that day. Then I poured myself a cup to go and headed off to work. 

It was a busy morning in the shop and it was almost noon before I had a chance to sit down with the Yellow Pages and scan the listings for divorce attorneys. I was looking for one close to the shop and there were a couple. I was wondering if I should ask around for some recommendations (since I did know several divorced guys) when the phone rang. It was Cookie. 

"I made arrangements for mom to keep JR overnight. We need to sit down and talk things over Frank. I taking off early from work and I'll have dinner ready when you get here. We can eat and then talk without being interrupted or having to worry about what JR hears." 

"What would be the point Cook? I'm pretty sure I made my position clear last night. Also there is the fact that I'm not likely to believe anything that you say." 

"It won't kill you to talk with me Frank. I'll see you tonight" and she hung up. 

I put the pone down, stared at it for a couple of seconds and then went back to making my list. I looked at he finished list and decided to ask my divorced friends about the names on the list. 

Dinner was waiting when I got home and Cookie even had a chilled Cabernet on the table. We ate in silence and then Cookie cleared the table and put the dishes in the dish washer. She sat down, took a sip of her wine and said: 

"I love you Frank. Don't ever doubt that. I don't want a divorce. I belong with you." 

"Then why were you doing what you were doing with Jason?" 

"I had a special relationship with Jason. At one time he meant the world to me and I fully expected that I would spend my life with him. Circumstances split us apart and for one reason or another we were never able to connect again. You and I also had a special relationship and I cared for you deeply, but even though I did love you it wasn't a love as deep as the love I had for Jason. 

"I'm not sure that we would have ever gotten married if it wasn't for JR, but JR happened and we did get married. In the years that followed I began to realize what a treasure I had in you and I came to love you as deeply as I had loved Jason. Three months ago, and it was only three months ago and not the six that you said, Jason called me and asked me to have lunch with me and I did. We talked about what happened in the past and brought each other up to date with our lives. I enjoyed myself so I said yes when he asked me to have lunch with him the next day. I did and I enjoyed his company. 

"He told me about his wife and his twin girls and I told him about you and JR. He left and then three weeks later he was back in town and he called me again and asked me to have lunch with him. This set a pattern. He would come to town every two or three weeks and he would call me and ask me to have lunch with him and I always said yes. I never told you about it because of your past history with Jason and all I could see was trouble if you knew. All that it was was two old friends getting together for lunch once in a while. After the second time I kissed him on the cheek the same as I usually do with old friends. You've seen me do it. 

"Anyway, the third time I went to kiss him on the cheek he turned his head so that I hit his mouth and he grabbed my head and held it as he gave me tongue. When he let me go he said he missed me terribly and that everything was wrong. It should be me he was married to. Then he said that he knew I felt the same and he asked me to come up to his room in the hotel. What was your favorite term for him back in high school? Asshole? Well that is just what he is; an asshole. A wife and two kids at home and he was trying to get me to go to bed with him. I realized if things had gone differently I would be married to him and the asshole would be out cheating on me. 

"I was pissed. He missed me terribly? Then why no phone calls or letters after he moved. Why no attempt to contact me at all? And he had such a poor opinion of me that he thought I'd leap at the chance to cheat on my husband with him. I decided to fuck with him. I decided to lead him on and make him think I would eventually do it. I would go just far enough that he thought he was going to score and then back off. The make out sessions got a little hotter each time and he was sure that he was going to get me. He told me he would leave his wife and that we could be together like it was always meant to be. 

"When I agreed to have dinner with him he thought for sure that I was going to end up in his room before the evening was over. I told him that you were out of town for two days and that my mom had JR and was keeping him overnight. I could see that in his mind he was already undressing me and planning on me spending the night. Halfway through dinner I got up to use the bathroom and while in there I called my mom and told her that I was in a meeting I wanted to get out of and I asked her to call me in twenty minutes. When she called I pretended the call was about something that happened to JR and that I had to leave. I could tell he was pissed that his prize for the evening had gotten away from him and it made me smile inside." 

She got up and went over to the counter and got her purse and came back to the table. She reached into her purse, came out with a piece of paper and handed it to me. 

"What is it?" 

"The post office receipt for the package I sent Jason's wife. I sent it 'Return receipt requested." 

"You sent his wife a package?" 

"When I decided that I was going to fuck with Jason I started carrying a voice activated cassette tape recorder in my purse. I sent her the recordings of what he said when we were together along with a note explaining who I was and I ended the note saying that I thought she should know what the asshole she was married to was up to when he was away from home. I very much doubt that Jason will be calling me the next time he comes to town." 

I looked at her and was silent for a bit and then I said, "I'm not sure that I can believe that story Cook. There are still things that happened that make me doubt it." 

"Like what?" 

"Every time you met him you came home happy as hell and you would never make love with me on those nights and then after he had gone back to wherever he lived you were snappish with me and irritable as hell for a day or two. That doesn't add up to being pissed at Jason. To me that meant you were happy as hell when he was around and you could be with him and moody and upset when he left and you had to come home and be with me. And the fact that you always turned me down for sex on the nights after being with him during the day told me that you were either afraid of me finding out I was getting sloppy seconds or you saw it as cheating on Jason." 

"You can't possibly believe that of me!" 

"Of course I can. All I have to go on is what I saw with my own two eyes and what I saw was a married woman making out with an old lover. Making out is all I saw on the two times I followed you, but who knows what you did on all the other times I wasn't watching. How do I know that those other times didn't end up being long lunches in a motel room somewhere? No Cook; your actions have put you in a position where I don't trust you enough to believe a word you say." 

"That's not fair Frank. If I felt that strongly about Jason why would I have sent that package to his wife?" 

"It could be that after I moved you into the spare bedroom and confronted you you decided that you needed to cover your butt. Maybe you really didn't believe him when he said he would leave his wife for you and you decided to force the issue. You sent her the package so she would kick him out and then he could be with you as soon as you could dump me." 

"Jesus Frank; you can't possibly think that. It just isn't so. How can you believe that I would do something like that after what we have had since we got married? You love me Frank and you and I both know that. I love you and you should know that too. You have to believe me Frank, you just have to believe me." 

I just sat there and looked at her. I wanted to believe her, I really did. I had loved her for so long that a part of me was screaming "Believe her you idiot" but another part of me was hollering "Believe your eyes Frank and remember how she was when Jason came into your lives." 

Finally she said, "What can I do to prove it to you Frank?" 

"I don't know that you can Cook. For one thing I notice you didn't respond to what I said about being happy when Jason was in town and pissed off and irritable when he left and all you had was me." 

"That's because I had no idea I was that way. If I had to guess I'd say it was because I really appreciated you and was happy to be with you after spending time with an asshole like Jason. As for the irritable part? Probably because I was upset with myself for going behind your back no matter how good I thought my reasons for doing it were." 

"And your refusal to make love?" 

"That had to be just coincidence. I must have had some legitimate reason for not wanting to make love on those nights. Help me out here Frank. Tell me how I can prove to you that I love you and I was just messing with Jason's head?" 

"I don't have a clue Cook. If you are able to do it you will have to be the one to figure it out." 

"Will you at least hold off talking to a lawyer to give me time to think of something?" 

"I guess I can for a while, but it won't be a long while so you will have to come up with something quick." 

I got up and went out to the garage to do some work on my truck. As far as I was concerned Cookie and I were history. I didn't think there was any possible way she could prove to me that she was just screwing with Jason's head and not doing what I thought she was. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

There would come a time when I would have to face Cookie's parents over our split and I had no intension of coming out of it the bad guy so I had to get something that I could use to show them it was their daughter's actions and not mine that caused our marriage to end. I didn't see how I could do it though since I never knew when Jason would come to town so I couldn't hire a private investigator to be in place waiting. 

We had two phones in the house so I went to Radio Shack and got three voice activated tape recorders and hid one near each phone and put one under the seat in Cookie's car. It was a wild shot and I didn't really think I would get much from them because I figured that Jason probably called Cookie at work, but I had to try something. 

I called Pauline and asked her to meet me for a drink after work. I told her what was going on and asked her to keep me up to date on anything she came across and she said she would. Two days later she called me and said: 

"I don't know if this means anything, but she just got a phone call that upset her. I heard her say "Fuck you asshole" as she hung up." 

I of course wondered what that was about. That night when I got home I collected all the recorders and listened to them. There was nothing on the one from the bedroom phone or from the one under the seat of her car, but there was something on the one from the one by the phone in the kitchen. I had no idea what time the call came in, either after I left for work or just after Cookie got home from work, but the call was obviously from Jason's wife. After saying "Hello" the conversation went: 

"This is she." 

"Yes, I sent it." 

"The note I enclosed should have explained it." 

"He's lying to you. There is no way I went after him. I had no idea where he has been since he moved from here. I hadn't seen or talked to him until he showed up where I work and asked me to have lunch with him."  

===

"Look honey; the tapes speak for themselves. You want to believe the asshole feel free, but keep in mind that this isn't the only place he travels to. You might want to consider what he is up to at the other places he visits." 

"No. I doubt very much he will be looking me up after my sending you the tapes." 

"Well fuck you too you stupid cunt!" 

Then there was the sound of the phone being slammed down on its cradle followed by, "What a stupid bitch!" 

Then followed the sounds of Cookie fixing dinner. I rewound the tapes and then put the recorders back in their hiding places. The call didn't prove anything one way or the other. All it proved was that Cookie had indeed sent Jason's wife some tapes, but the question was still there. Did she do it to force a wedge between Jason and his wife so Jason would be free Cookie to hook up with or was she really trying to burn him? 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Another week went by and I decided that it was time for me to start checking out the attorneys on my list. I talked to a couple of divorced friends of mine and found out that they had both used the same lawyer and neither one had anything good to say about him so I crossed him off the list. Both friends told me that their ex-wives lawyers were pretty damned good and one of them was on my list so I put a check mark next to his name. 

Once I decided that I was going to go for the divorce I started thinking of how to protect my business so I didn't lose it in the divorce. I talked with Uncle Mike about it and he came up with the solution to the problem. Since I was buying it from him and making payments to him he wrote me several letters and back dated them. The gist was that I was behind on my payments and if I didn't catch up by such and such a date he would take the business back. The last letter said he was sorry, but since I was four months behind in my payments he was taking the business back. I could stay on as manager, but at a reduced salary. 

Everything was back dated to before I found out about Cookie and Jason. Since the original deal was between me and Uncle Mike and no other parties had been involved there was no way Cookie and her lawyer, whoever he turned out to be, could prove different. 

The business secure I turned my attention back to my list of attorneys. After talking to several people I had narrowed the list down to two names, but before I could contact one of them circumstances changed. It was ten in the morning when Pauline's call came. 

"Just keeping you up to date sweetie. Cookie was hauled off to jail about ten minutes ago." 

"Hauled off to jail? You've got to be kidding." 

"Not in the least." 

"What did she do? Steal the office petty cash?" 

"A little more serious than that. She put Jason in the hospital." 

"What?!!" 

"Jason came storming in here, called her a stupid fucking bitch for fucking up his marriage and told her that she would pay for it. I didn't see it happen myself, but a couple of the guys said it looked like Jason was going to hit her. One of the guys hollered at him and when Jason looked to see who yelled Cookie picked up the paperweight off of her desk and bashed him in the head with it. 

"He fell to the floor and while he was down there she kicked him in the balls a couple of times and told him he was a cheating lying bastard and that he deserved whatever he got. Jason's head was bleeding pretty badly and someone called 911. That got the cops involved and they took Cookie away." 

As I hung up the phone I was thinking that the question of the two of them getting together if Jason and his wife were to split was answered. Maybe, just maybe, Cookie had been telling the truth. I debated rushing down to the police station or waiting for Cookie to call me. I decided to sit tight. If I rushed down there she would want to know how I knew and if I told her it would also tell her that I was in touch with Pauline and I wanted to keep that a secret for a while. Always nice to have a spy in the other camp if you know what I mean. 

Three hours later I got a call to come down and pick her up. The police had investigated and the people in Cookie's office all swore that Jason was about to hit her and she had defended herself so she was released on her own recognizance. 

An asshole of an assistant district attorney decided that even though she was defending herself kicking a helpless man when he was lying on the floor bleeding was uncalled for and he charged her with simple assault. If she had gone for a jury trial she would have beaten it, but she opted for just appearing in front of a judge. He found her guilty, fined her three hundred dollars plus court costs and two hundred hours of community service. 

She got a thank you card from Jason's about to be ex-wife with a short note enclosed saying that she should have used the paperweight on Jason's head a few more times. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

And the two of us? 

We are putting it back together, but it is going slowly because I am still pissed over what she did and it flares up occasionally. Cookie knows that there is still a small kernel of doubt in my mind over what she did. Did she sleep with Jason? Was everything she did after I confronted her done because she was telling me the truth or because by then she had come to the realization that Jason had no intension of leaving his wife and so she did her best to make me think she was telling me the truth. 

We are back in the same bedroom and Cookie's way of trying to make me forget is to try fucking my brains out. I'm willing to try to forget her actions, but I honestly doubt that I ever will. It might fade away for a while, but sooner or later something will happen that will bring that small kernel of doubt back Some one will say something, I'll see a picture of something or an old classmate will mention that he saw Jason somewhere and it all comes back. I think Cookie realizes that and so she goes out of her way to spoil me rotten. 

Cookie still works at the real estate office and Pauline still works there also. Pauline and I have lunch every once in a while. She is still my eyes and ears at the office, but it has been almost eight months now and she has had nothing to report. I think Cookie and I are going to be okay, but I'm going to be a lot more vigilant from now on. Cookie knows that she has had her "One time shame on you" and that from now on I am never going to be in the "Two times shame on me" position and if she loves me as much as she says she does she will make sure that it never happens.  

===

The day showed no signs of being a disaster when I woke up. The alarm went off at five and my wife Diane reached for me and pulled me back down as I started to get out of bed. She kissed me, slipped me a little tongue and her hand reached for my cock. Twenty-five years and the woman could still turn me into a quivering wreck. She pulled me on top of her and as my cock parted her nether lips she said: 

"Make it a good morning lover; make it a very good morning." 

I pushed into her and she moaned, "Oh God yes lover, do it hard lover, do it." 

She moaned, she cried, she dug her nails into the cheeks of my ass and pulled me to her and then she came just seconds before I did. 

She got up to fix the coffee while I took my showered and then I fixed us breakfast while she showered. We discussed what our days were likely to be like as we ate and then she asked: 

"Meatloaf and baked potatoes okay for dinner tonight?" 

"Sounds great. I'll stop at the bakery and pick up a loaf of fresh French bread and maybe a pecan pie." 

"Ooooh, pecan pie. Out to spoil me are you?" 

"Can't think of anyone I'd rather spoil." 

We kissed and walked hand in hand into the garage, kissed once more and then we both headed off to work. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

The drive in was uneventful and so was the first half of the morning. Around eleven Harry (my boss) called me into his office. 

"We have a situation in St. Louis. Baker caught Smithers with his wife and now Baker is in jail and Smithers is in the hospital. There is no one there to run the office. I hate to do this to you on such short notice, but you have to catch the two-twenty flight, get to St. Louis and take charge of the office. 

"I don't know how long you will be there. I guess it will depend on just how bad Baker fucked up Smithers. If it is too bad he might not get out of jail for a while and Smithers might not get out of the hospital anytime soon. Even if the both get out soon I don't see how they will be able to work together. I'll have to think long and hard on it, but I can't see anyway other than to let one of them go. Which one I don't know. I'll need a lot more information before I can make that decision." 

"Seems cut and dried to me. Smithers fucked with Baker's wife. Smithers should have expected Baker to get pissed if he ever found out." 

"I don't know for a fact that Baker caught Smithers with his wife or that Smithers is even guilty. All I've got is what the secretary told me when she called. Maybe you can find out more for me when you get there." 

I called Diane to let her know what was going on, but her secretary told me that she was in a meeting. I told her I'd call back and then I headed home to pack a bag. 

Diane's car was in the driveway when I got home and I wondered what was up with that. She was supposed to be in a meeting. When I walked into the living room I saw that she was indeed in a meeting, but it wasn't the kind of meeting I had envisioned when her secretary told me she was in one. 

There was a trail of clothing on the floor leading from the couch to the stairway and some of those clothes were men's clothes. At the foot of the steps there was a pair of men's trousers and I picked them up and found a wallet in one of the back pockets. I took it out, opened it up and read the name Stanton North on the driver's license. I put the wallet in my pocket and then looked around the room and saw a suit coat over the back of the easy chair. It yielded a checkbook and I put that in my pocket too. 

I walked up the stairs and as I got close to the top of the steps I began hearing what was coming from the bedroom. 

"Fuck me. Fuck me hard." 

"Like it do you?" 

"Oh God yes. You feel so good in me. Fuck me baby, fuck me." 

"I would never have believed you could be such a hot little slut. Like my cock?" 

"Love your cock. Just keep giving it to me." 

I walked into the room and saw a man pounding into Diane and she had her legs wrapped around him and her hands on his ass pulling him to her. 

"Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me" she was moaning as I walked past on my way to the closet. I was almost to the closet door before Stanton North saw me and he stopped in mid-stroke and said: 

"Oh shit!" 

Diane had her eyes closed as he fucked her and when he stopped they popped open and she cried: 

"Don't stop. Damn it, don't stop, I'm almost th..." and then she saw me and cried "No. Oh God no" and started trying to get out from under North. 

"Don't stop on my account" I said as I entered the closet. "I just need to pack a bag and then I'll get out of here and leave you two love birds alone." 

I had my back to them as I took socks and underwear out of the dresser drawer and put them in the suitcase, but I could hear them behind me. Diane was saying "Get off me damn it" while North was saying "Christ what a mess." When I turned to go back into the closet for a garment bag I saw North heading out the bedroom door and Diane scrambling to find something to cover herself with. As she scrambled she was saying things like: 

"What are you doing Frank? Why are you packing" and uttering nonsense like "It isn't what you think Frank" and "I can explain Frank." 

While she was babbling I heard the front door slam shut and I wondered where North was going. Diane's car was the only one in the driveway so he must have arrived with her. 

I ignored Diane as I finished packing and I didn't respond to her "We need to talk Frank. You have to let me explain." 

I walked out the front door without having said a word since walking into the bedroom and telling them not to stop on my account. As I walked to my car Diane was hollering: 

"Wait Frank; don't go. Please talk to me." 

As I opened my car door I looked around but saw no sign of Stanton North. Maybe he was hiding somewhere watching and would come back when he saw me drive away. Diane was running down the front walk and almost had her hand on the passenger side door handle when I pulled away from the curb. 

It is an absolute wonder that I made it to the airport without killing myself or someone else. My mind was definitely not on my driving. How had it happened? Why had it happened? I would have bet all that I had that Diane and I were rock solid. I looked back on our life together and I didn't see anything – not one thing – that would ever have led me to believe that what I had just seen was even remotely possible. My God! How could she have done what she did to me when we got up that morning and then do what I had just seen her doing? 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Diane and I met when my father received a promotion and had to move the family fifteen hundred miles away. The move was a bitch as far as I was concerned. I was taken away from the kids I had grown up with and gone to school with and then dumped into a school where I didn't know a single soul. I was sitting alone at a table in the school cafeteria at lunch time and feeling sorry for myself when the most beautiful girl I had ever seen came over to the table and sat down with me. She set her tray down and said: 

"Hi there new kid." 

She reached across the table and stuck out her hand and said. "I'm Diane." It took me a second or two before I realized she was offering me her hand to shake. I took it and said: 

"Hi Diane, I'm Frank." 

"Where you from Frank?" she asked and then we spent the rest of the lunch period getting to know each other. She had joined me at my table because she had known what I was going through because the same thing had happened to her the previous year. By the time the bell rang we had made a date for her to show me around the town. 

Within six weeks we were going steady and like all typical teenagers we were making out like mad. Being a guy with raging hormones I naturally tried to get Diane to go all the way, but she wouldn't do it. She was determined to honor her promise to her mother to go to her marriage bed a virgin. Luckily for my sanity she broke that promise on her eighteenth birthday. 

We had some serious discussions after the night she gave me her cherry. I told her that I wanted to marry her, but that I didn't want to get married until I finished college. She wanted to get married right away and she wasn't happy with me because I wanted to wait. I was telling my mom about it when she surprised the hell out of me. I'd always thought of my mom as being a bit on the prudish side, but she said: 

"So move in with her and live together until you graduate." 

"How can I do that? The reason I want to wait is so that I can afford it. No way I can support a wife and go to school at the same time." 

"You might have to get a part time job to help out with the groceries, but you college fund has enough in it to let you rent a small place off campus." 

I thought about it and then brought it up to Diane. We talked it over and decided we would both get part time jobs and do it. We went looking and found a small apartment that I could afford and then we went to do the hard part – tell her parents. 

Her mom was horrified that Diane hadn't kept to her promise on holding on to her virginity. She cried and blubbered while Diane's father called me every name in the book and some that he made up on the spot. Then he told Diane that he absolutely forbid it and furthermore she was never to see me again. Diane looked at me and asked me to wait in the car. Ten minutes later she came out carrying two suitcases. 

She never told me what went on when I left the house, but it was three years before she ever talked to her parents again and only then to tell them that they had a grandson. Suddenly I was a great guy, there daughter was lucky to have found me and on and on and on. But the damage had already been done and on my part I tolerated them, but that was all. Diane eventually forgave them and they became part of our lives. They were great grandparents to our three kids, but like I said, I just tolerated them. 

The years past by, the kids grew up and set out on their own and now this. At least the kids wouldn't grow up having divorced parents.

I got to the airport early, checked in and then sat down in one of the many airport coffee shops to wait for my flight to be called. I took out North's wallet and checkbook and began going through them. Behind his driver's license I found a card the said "Emergency Information." It gave his blood type and some other information, but the part that caught my eye was the part where it gave his emergency contact. Arlis North and under "Relationship" it said "wife" and it gave a number where she could be reached. I took out my cell phone and called it. 

"Hello?" 

"Mrs. North?" 

"Yes." 

"My name is Frank Bellows. I'm sorry to be making this call, but I just found your husband in bed with my wife and I thought you should know." 

"You're joking, right?" 

"No ma'am, I'm afraid not." 

"Well I don't believe you Mr. Whoever you are. My Stan would never do a thing like that to me." 

"Tell you what. When he gets home tonight ask him if he knows a Diane Bellows and then ask him to show you his wallet and checkbook. He won't be able to because I have them. I took them out of his clothes when I found them lying on my living room floor when I went home early. I am at the airport right now waiting to catch a flight to St. Louis. When I get back home I'd be happy to hand deliver them to you." 

"You are really serious about this?" 

"I'm sorry, but I am." 

"When will you be back?" 

"I don't know. I have to go and fill in for someone who is off sick and I'll be there until he can get back to work." 

"Could you mail me the wallet and checkbook?" 

"I could I suppose, but I'll let you know this ahead of time. Your husbands wallet has eighty-seven dollars in it and after what I saw when I walked into my bedroom I feel a crying need to get drunk and drown my sorrows and your hubby is going to foot the bill for it. There will probably be some left, but I have no idea how much." 

"Send it to my office." She gave me the address and I wrote it down and then she said, "If you can send it overnight and I'll reimburse you." 

"I can do that. They just called my flight so I have to go." 

I said goodbye and disconnected. North got lucky. My original plan was to leave his wallet and credit cards on the counter in the bathroom and hope that whoever found it would go on a spending spree, but getting in touch with his wife changed all that. Hopefully she would make his life a living hell. 

My cell had been going off almost from the moment I left the house and every time I looked it was Diane so I didn't take the call. It rang again as I was leaving the coffee shop and I looked expecting it to be another call from Diane, but this time it was from the office. I called back and got Harry. 

"You need to call home Frank. Diane just called me and she is frantic because she can't get in touch with you." 

"There is a reason for that Harry. I'm not taking her calls. When I went home to pack she was there and she wasn't alone and she was doing things she shouldn't have been doing. I talk with her when I get back. Maybe by then I'll have calmed down enough not to wrap my hands around her throat and squeeze. Make things easy on yourself and tell the receptionist not to take her calls." 

+++++++++++++++ 

The first thing I did after seeing to it that the office was running smoothly and that there were no immediate was to hit the Post Office and send Mrs. North her husband's wallet and checkbook. I included the information on where I was staying so she could call if she had any questions. That taken care of I called the police and found out where Baker was being held and if I could see him. 

Outside of bruised knuckles and a broken finger Baker didn't look too bad. He hadn't had a bail hearing yet because the powers that be were waiting on word from the hospital on just how bad Smithers was so they would know what charges to file. I told him about Harry's concerns and asked him for the story. 

It sounded all too familiar. 

He had returned home during his lunch hour to pick up something that he had forgotten to take with him in the morning and he'd walked in on Smithers who was using his lunch hour to pork Baker's wife. While he was stomping the shit out of Smithers his wife was on the phone to 911 telling them that her husband had gone crazy and that she feared for her life. The cops showed up, Smithers went to the hospital and Baker went to jail. 

My next stop was to the hospital to see Smithers. He had a broken nose, two broken ribs, two cracked ribs and they had removed his right testicle. From him I got: 

"It wasn't my fault. The bitch came after me so of course I tapped her. I'm single and I like pussy as much as the next guy. If anybody is at fault here it is Baker. If he took care of the bitch and gave her what she needed she wouldn't be out looking." 

He got no sympathy from me. I called Harry and told him the story and said that my recommendation was to transfer Smithers out of the office unless he could find some grounds for firing the guy and I told him I would take a hard look at things in the office and see if I could find something that he could use. 

Baker's hearing was the next day and bail was set at two hundred and fifty thousand. The only way he could come up with the money was to put his house up as collateral, but his wife refused to sign off on it so he was going to have to sit in jail until his father and brother could arrange something. 

The next morning at nine-thirty I got a call from Arlis North. She told me that when her husband came home she asked him if he knew a Diane Bellows and she said that his face lost all of its color as he said that he didn't know a Diane Bellows. She asked him if he was sure and he said that he was pretty sure. Then she asked him for his wallet and checkbook and he patted his pockets and said that he must have left them on his desk at work. 

"Then he changed the subject and asked what was for dinner. He knows he is in deep shit, but he doesn't know how deep it is and he won't know until tomorrow when I ask him for his wallet and checkbook again. Do you have any idea of how long it was going on?" 

"I just know that it was. I walked in on them and then I left." 

"What does your wife have to say?" 

"No idea. I haven't spoken to her since walking into the bedroom and catching them and I won't be talking to her until I get home." 

"When you do talk to her call me. I'd like to compare their stories." 

"Will do. I'd like to hear both sides too." 

+++++++++++++++++ 

I had a dozen calls a day from Diane, but I didn't take any of them. Harry must have told her I was in St. Louis and she must have gotten the office number from information. Dixie, our receptionist, told me that I had a call on line three and when I picked it up it was Diane. 

"What do you want Diane?" 

"We need to talk Frank. I need to explain that what happened isn't what you think." 

"I'm in no mood to talk to you right now. I'm still at the point where I want to strangle you to death and then take my shotgun and go looking for your lover and kill him too." 

"He is not my lov....." 

"Save it Diane. Don't call here anymore. We will talk when I get home and not before" and I hung up on her. 

In mid-afternoon I got a call from Baker's father telling me that bail had been arranged and that he would be released the next morning. In a way I was sorry to hear that. As long as Baker was in jail and Smithers was in the hospital I didn't have to go home and deal with Diane. 

I had dinner and drinks on North again that night and made it back to my room about seven. The phone rang and since only Harry and Arlis North had the number I answered it. It was Arlis. We exchanged hellos and then she filled me in on the latest from her end. 

"When he got home I asked him again for his wallet and checkbook and he said that they were gone from his office when he got there. He said that someone on the night cleaning crew must have taken them and that he would file a complaint when he went in to work the next morning." 

I had to laugh at that. "Just how long does he think he can put it off?" 

"I don't know how long he thought he could, but I put an end to it. I asked him just how stupid that he thought I was. I told him that he knew he was busted when I asked about your wife and then asked for the wallet and checkbook. There was only one way I could have put the two of them together and he knew it. Then the dumb shit said that he didn't know what I was talking about. That pissed me off so I took his wallet and checkbook out of my purse and threw them in his face. Then I told him how I'd gotten them and that I'd called his office and found out that he worked with the woman he claimed he didn't know. Then I fibbed a bit. I told him that when you got home from St. Louis you were going to stop by and show me the pictures you took with your cell phone camera before they knew you were there." 

"How did he take that?" 

"He finally realized that he was caught and he broke down, begged forgiveness and swore that it was the only time that he had ever been unfaithful. He said he couldn't help it, that your wife had chased him for months and that it was hard to ignore a beautiful woman who was hot for your body." 

"Too bad I wasn't thinking a little more clearly when I walked in on them. My cell phone does have a camera; I just never thought to use it. Do you believe his story?" 

"That she chased after him? It could be true. She wouldn't be the first. Was it only the one time with her? That could be true too, but he was lying through his teeth when he said that it was the only time he ever cheated. I know of at least three times that he has strayed. Well, that's not quite true. Three times I've had people tell me that he ran around on me when I was out of town visiting relatives. I've never confronted him on them, because I really didn't want to know if it was true."  

===

"You said that his saying that Diane chased him could be true and that she wouldn't have been the first. Why did you say that?" 

"Stan is rather well endowed and some women when they hear that want to check it out." 

"A week ago I would have said Diane would never do anything like that, but that was before I walked in on her and your husband." 

"I've got to go, but if I learn anything else I'll give you a call. Don't forget; I want to her hear side when you get home and talk with her." 

"I won't." 

+++++++++++++++++ 

At eleven the next morning Ray Baker called me to let me know he was out of jail on bail. He was going to have to take the rest of the day and the next day to take care of personal business. His wife had taken out a restraining order on him and he needed to find a place to stay and make arrangements with the court to get into his house to get his personal things. He said that he would be in on Thursday. 

I called Harry and brought him up to date and then I told him that in checking into things at the office I had found that Smithers had been fudging his expense reports and that could possibly be grounds for letting him go. I told him I would probably fly home Thursday evening and that I was going to need to take Friday off to handle my personal affairs and I would see him Monday morning. 

I managed to get through the next two days without incident and on Thursday morning Ray was back at work. I brought him up to date on what was going on in the office and then because I was going through something similar I asked him how things were going on the home front. 

"The restraining order only keeps me five hundred feet away from her. I can access the house whenever I want as long as she isn't there. If she is there and won't leave when I want to go in I have to get someone from the court to go in with me. I just waited down the street until she went to work and then me and my brother went in and got everything that I wanted. I have no need to go back. 

"I don't know what the stupid cunt is thinking. She got the order, but that was all. She didn't touch the bank accounts. I cleaned them out yesterday." 

"I thought that this was a no fault state and that everything had to be split fifty-fifty." 

"In a divorce that would be true, but I'm not talking divorce; I'm just walking away. If she wants a divorce she can pay for it and when she files she will be entitled to fifty percent of our assets at the time she files and that will be zip. We took out a second on the house to finish the basement and make it into a recreation room so there is no equity in the house and the money I took out of the bank will be long gone. I can claim that I needed it all to set me up in a new place when she barred me from the house. That reminds me. I need to call Harry and get my insurance and all of that other crap changed." 

"She tell you why she did it?" 

"I haven't spoken to the whore since the cops hauled me away and I have no intention of talking to her. It doesn't matter why she did it; it only matters that she did." 

I decided to get a good night's sleep before going home and having to talk to Diane so I called the airline and made reservations for the morning flight. 

++++++++++++++++ 

I was rested when I got up and I had a good breakfast before catching the airport shuttle and I was home in Denver by eleven. I hit the bank, cleaned out the savings, cashed in five of the nine certificates of deposit in the deposit box and put all the money in the checking account. 

Diane was at work when I got home so I would be alone until six. I got on the phone, got pay off balances for all of our credit cards and then cancelled all but five of them. I kept the American Express card that I used primarily for business expenses and two of the other cards in my name and put two in Diane's name. I went back to the bank and arranged wire transfers to pay off the cards using the money in the checking account. That done I took half of the money left in checking and opened a checking account in my name only. I arranged for another safe deposit box in my name only and put two of the remaining four CDs into it and then went back home. 

When the kids had grown and moved out I had converted one of their bedrooms into a home office and den and the other two where kept as spare rooms for when the kids came home to visit. I picked the spare bedroom next to the den and moved all of my things into it. I was all moved in and set up when Diane came home. 

I heard Diane come in and call for me. "Frank? Frank? Where are you?" 

I ignored her as I heard her walking through the house looking for me. She finally came upstairs and I had my back to the door when she came in. 

"Frank? I ignored her. "Frank? Please Frank; we need to talk." 

I turned to face her. "Where is it written that I have to talk to an unfaithful whore?" She winced when I said that and then I said, "However we do need to talk about finances." 

"Finances? Why?" 

"Because your actions have made changes necessary. Go on downstairs and take a seat at the kitchen table and I'll be down in a minute." 

She left and I sorted through the papers I had been working on, picked up the ones I needed and then followed Diane down to the kitchen and took a seat across from her. 

"While I was gone I had a lot of time to think about what I should do and in the end I decided to do nothing." 

I saw relief on her face when I said that, but it faded when I said, "By nothing I mean that I will be having little or nothing to do with you. I can't see wasting money on divorce attorneys especially since at my age I don't see another marriage in my future so I'm not going to need single status. If you want a divorce you can go for it and pay for it. For now though there are some changes." 

I explained all that I had done with the credit cards, the savings, the CDs and the checking account. "You can have the original deposit box, but I would recommend that you open your own checking and savings accounts and we will leave the old joint account in place and call it the household account. With me so far?" 

"But why are you do..." 

"You know damned well why Diane. Okay now, the household account will be used for household expenses." I slid a piece of paper across the table to her. "That is a list of what it takes to run the house. House payment, electric bill, phone, gas, water and sewage, taxes and insurance. What we are from now on is roommates. You will need to deposit half of the amount on that paper into the household account every month from now on. We will share the house with the exception of two rooms. You will have the master bedroom as your room and Carol's old room will be my bedroom." 

"Why are you moving into Carol's room? You need to be in the master bedroom with me." 

"After what I saw taking place in that room? There is no way I'm going to stay in that room, sleep on that bed or have anything to do with the woman I saw doing what she was doing on that bed." 

"That's what we need to talk about Frank. What you saw isn't what you think." 

"Of course it was what I think it was. It was you fucking another man in our house and on our bed." 

"Okay Frank, but what you need to understand is that is all that it was – fucking. There was no love or affection involved; it was just me satisfying my curiosity. I love you Frank. I always have and I always will. What I felt for Stan was just a little bit of lust and that's all. It was a one-time thing to satisfy my curiosity and if you had not have come home you would never have known and it would have never happened again." 

"But that is the problem Diane. I did come home and I do know and because I know it changes everything. You cheated on me and that means that you can't be trusted. If you can't be trusted that means that everything you say has to be weighed and looked at to try and determine if it is the truth or a lie. You say you love me. Can you love me and still betray me? Can you love me and still disrespect me by bringing another man into my house and then fucking him on my bed? The same bed you would have slept on with me that night? How much love and respect would you be showing me by giving me that man's leavings if I would have made love to you that night? 

"No Diane, you can no longer be trusted. You say it was a one time thing and would have never happened again. Truth or lie? I only have your word for it that it is true, but you can't be trusted. It could just as easily been the tenth time and you could have already set up a time to do it again. But, and this is the part that counts, even if it is the truth you still stabbed me in the back. You broke the promise that you made to me when we took our vows and for what? To satisfy some curiosity of yours? Just what the hell were you so curious about that you were willing to risk your marriage to satisfy it?" 

She looked away from me when she said, "The size of his penis." 

"You have got to be shitting me. The size of his dick? Why in the hell were you curious about the size of his dick?" 

"Some of the girls in the office had gone out with him and they raved about how big it was and how filling it was. I listened to all the stories they told, but I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to them until he started hitting on me. Even then it was a while before I started thinking about it." 

"You are saying that he tried to seduce you?" 

"I guess he was, but I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it at first. But I liked the attention and what woman doesn't like to feel that she is attractive. At my age it was a hell of a boost to my self esteem to have a man ten years younger than me to paying attention to me. I had lunch with him a couple of times and danced with him a couple of times when everyone in the office would stop for drinks. It was dancing with him that started me thinking of the stories I'd heard about him. I felt him push against me a time or two and he did seem rather large. 

"The more I thought about the stories the more curious I got. I was a virgin when I met you and you are the only man I've ever known sexually. I got to wondering what another man would be like especially a man reputed to be as big as Stan. He kept working on me and I kept wondering and I finally let my curiosity get the best of me." 

"You say all the other girls talked about Stan's size and abilities in bed? How many other girls?" 

"Seven of them." 

"Stan had sex with seven of them?" 

"They said he did." 

"Seven of them in your office alone. That would seem to show that Stan was pretty promiscuous. Did you ever stop to think that a guy who was fucking anything that moved might pick up a disease or two somewhere along the line?" 

"Oh come on Frank. If that were the case he would have given it to the girls he made love to and you can believe that if he did it would be broadcast all over the office in minutes." 

"You can have it and not know it Diane. In some cases you can have it for months before you show signs. If I were you I'd go and get myself tested." 

"The important thing Frank is that Stan meant nothing to me. There was no love involved and I can't say that there was even much like." 

"That's not what it sounded like when I walked into the room." 

"You know I like sex Frank and you know how vocal I get when I make love to you. So I made some noise. It was because I was in the middle of having sex and not because I had any special feelings for Stan. It was a mistake Frank. A major mistake and I'm sorry as hell that I slipped up and I can promise you that it will never happen again. I love you Frank and you know that I do. You can't throw away twenty-five good years because of one mistake." 

"I'm not throwing anything away Diane. You are the one who threw it away when you brought another man into my house and took him on my bed." 

I got up and left the kitchen and went back upstairs to the den and lost myself in some paperwork. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I'm a fairly light sleeper and that night about an hour after I went to bed the noise of the bedroom door opening woke me up. Diane quietly moved into the room and softly closed the door behind her. I sleep nude and it was summer so I was lying on top of the covers. Diane bent over me and took my cock into her mouth. She had always been able to turn me to jelly when she blew me and it looked like she planned to do it again in an attempt to get back into my good graces. She was totally surprised when I pushed her away. 

"Leave me alone Diane. I am not in the least bit interested in North's leftovers." 

She got off the bed and left the room crying. Maybe twenty minutes later I fell asleep and I wasn't bothered the rest of the night. 

Diane was in the kitchen making coffee when I came down from taking my morning shower and getting ready to go to work. Her "Good morning Frank" was met with a noncommittal grunt. I ignored her until the coffee was ready and then filled my travel mug and left for work. I waited until ten before calling Arlis North and then I filled her in on what I'd found out. 

"Seven other girls?" 

"That is what she said. Apparently your husband was the office Romeo." 

"Do you believe her story?" 

"Before I walked in on her and your husband I would have believed her if she had told me that the sun was now rising in the west, but after? I don't know. It could be true or it could be that she is just trying to put a better light on what she did by making me think that it really meant nothing." I mean how do you know? When she got caught trust went out the window. Everything she says now has to be seen as self serving." 

"Have you decided what you are going to do?" 

"The marriage is dead, but if there is a divorce she will have to be the one to go for it. My plan right now is to simply cohabit. We will coexist as roommates, but that is all. I can't see ruining myself financially just because she couldn't keep her panties on. How about you? Got a plan yet?" 

"I'm still thinking on it. Keep in touch Frank." 

"Will do Arlis. Good luck." 

++++++++++++++ 

For the next week I made sure that I was up and gone before Diane woke up and I found things to do that kept me from going home until late. Diane was usually up waiting for me, but I ignored her. The next weekend she tried to slip into my bed again, but I told her to get away from me and leave me alone. 

"Damn it Frank; don't do this to me. I love you Frank and I want you." 

"I don't want you Diane. You are damaged goods." 

"My God Frank. It was only once. I haven't even talked to him since he ran out of the house. It was a one time slip in judgment Frank. Please! Give me a chance. I know it was wrong and I'm sorry. I swear to God that it will never happen again." 

"The problem Diane is that I don't know that it was only once. He may have been your third or fourth lover or your tenth. You may still be doing him on your lunch hours in a motel. When I caught you with him you lost all my trust Diane and there is no way I will ever trust you to tell me the truth ever again." 

"Please Frank, there has to be some way to put us back together. I'll do anything Frank; anything at all." 

"Sorry Diane, but there is no chance of our getting back together because I don't want to put us back together. The sight of you with your legs wrapped around North and the sound of your voice as you begged him to fuck you harder killed all the feelings I had for you. Look on the bright side. You are free to indulge in satisfying your curiosity whenever you want now. Just not here in this house. This house is neutral territory. You take your men elsewhere and I won't bring my women here." 

"Your women?" 

"I have no intension of going without a sex life. I'm not a bad looking guy and I've had chances up the kazoo to play around, but I never did because I promised during our wedding ceremony that I'd be faithful to you. You made the same vows, but you broke them. When you broke your vows you released me from mine. At least I won't be bringing mine in here where you can see it." 

She looked at me and I could tell what she was thinking. She was thinking that sharing the house and being around each other would give her a chance to work her way back into my life and that is just what I wanted her to think. I decided to give her a load to carry. 

"The only reason I'm doing this share the house thing is that I don't want to make the lawyers rich by going through a divorce and I don't want to give up what I have here at the house to live in an apartment. I wouldn't have a garage to work in, a basement workshop and I wouldn't have a patio where I can sit and enjoy a drink as I watch the sun set. You have two choices Diane; live with the new status quo or not. If you chose not then you can either move out or take over the house payments and expenses and I'll move out. 

"You say that you really do love me so here is your chance to prove it. You can accept home sharing or you can take the house and cost me my garage, my workshop and my patio just like you cost me my wife. Your choice." 

"There is no chance?" 

"I don't see how there could be Diane." 

She was silent for a few moments and then she opened her mouth and drove the final nail into her coffin. 

"What are you going to do with the pictures Frank?" 

"The pictures?" 

"The ones you took with your cell phone camera." 

She hadn't even talked to North since he ran out of the house? Then how did she know about the cell phone pictures? That was a story made up by Arlis and fed to her husband a good five days after I'd caught Diane and North in our bedroom. No indeed. I could not trust anything Diane told me ever again. 

I could not physically hurt her and kicking her out of the house would cost me more than it would punish her, but being around me all the time while I ignored her would put her through a mental hell and that was the best I could hope for. I did not doubt that she loved me and I knew she would hang in there on the remote chance that she might eventually work her way back into my good graces. It wasn't going to happen. I was not kidding when I said that seeing her with North had killed all my feelings for her, but the longer she held on hoping the longer my revenge would last. 

My revenge against Diane in place I turned my attention to Stanton North. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

The private detectives report backed up what I had suspected. Getting caught by me and his wife finding out that he was a cheating asshole had not slowed him down a single bit. He was laying pipe to five women besides his wife. In the three weeks I'd had the PIs on him he hadn't done a thing with Diane, but he was nailing two of her co-workers. One of them, Mary Ellen Bingham had a husband that worked the afternoon shift and every Tuesday and Thursday after work North would pay Mary Ellen a visit at her home on Sunflower Way. He stayed two hours and then left. 

I checked my watch and saw that if he kept to his schedule he would be out of the house in ten minutes. I was parked one block away and one block over. I got out of my car and made my way over to the Bingham residence went around behind the garage and when I got there I slipped on the latex gloves and put on a ski mask. 

Mary Ellen had a three car garage and when North visited he pulled into the garage and parked and closed the garage door so the neighbors wouldn't get to talking about Mary Ellen's visitor. Wouldn't want the word to get back to Mary Ellen's hubby now would we? I used a small pry bar to force the lock on the back door to the garage and I was waiting when the connecting door to the house opened and North came out. A naked Mary Ellen stood in the doorway and watched North walk to his car. 

Fifty thousand volts from the Taser had him writhing on the garage floor and before Mary Ellen could even scream I said in what I hoped was a disguised voice:  

===

"Scream or call the cops and your hubby will find out what has been going on. Best you go back in the house and pretend that nothing is going on out here. I won't kill him, but you can be sure that another husband that he has stabbed in the back is getting even." 

She jumped backwards and slammed the door. Mary Ellen knew me from all the company picnics and Christmas parties that Diane had taken me to, but I was counting on the ski mask and the disguised voice to keep her from knowing who was fucking over her fuck buddy. I couldn't count on her not calling the police so I had to hurry. I pulled North's pants off of him and believe me when I tell you that pulling pants off of a guy in convulsions isn't easy. 

Once I had his pants off I took my revenge. 

Proud of his package was he? Well his package was going to pay. I took the fully charged cattle prod and touched it to his cock and balls as many times as I could until it was fully discharged. I kicked him twice in the ribs for the hell of it and then I took his wallet and checkbook and got the hell out of there. I heard no sirens so maybe Mary Ellen didn't call the cops. 

As I drove away I thought about what I had just done. I had no idea how much damage, if any, that the cattle prod would cause and whether or not there would be any last effects, but I can honestly say that I enjoyed everyone of North's screams when a cattle prod charge flashed through his cock and balls. 

I never did hear how Mary Ellen made out on the deal. Was she able to get North out of there and keep her husband in the dark or did she have to call for medical attention for North and have to explain an ambulance at the house to her hubby? 

Still wearing the latex gloves I put the wallet and checkbook in a package I had already prepared and sent it to Arlis at her office. There was no note enclosed and I would deny I knew anything about it, but when her hubby came home hurting and then his wallet showed up in the mail she would think she knew who had done it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Three weeks after my little party with North I got a phone call from Arlis. 

"You busy for lunch?" 

"I haven't made any plans; why?" 

"I think it is time for us to have a face to face. How about noon at the Lido? I'll be the redhead anxiously checking out every man who walks in to see if I can figure out which one is you." 

"Noon it is." 

I didn't see her anxiously checking faces, but she was easy to spot since she was the only redhead in the place sitting alone. North was a flaming idiot to be screwing around on her. She was drop dead gorgeous. I walked up to her table. 

"Mrs. North?" 

"No Frank; it is Arlis. You haven't called me Mrs. North since our first phone conversation." 

I took a seat across from her and said, "Might I ask what prompted you to ask me to lunch?" 

"I just wanted a good look at the man who keeps screwing up my life." 

"I'm screwing up your life? How am I doing that?" 

"First you made me pull my head out of the sand and face up to what I was fairly sure he was doing, but hoped he wasn't. Then, after I let him talk me into giving him one more chance, you took away the best thing that he had going for him." 

"I don't understand." 

"Sure you do. Stan is a good provider and a pretty decent father to our kids, but the best thing that he had going for him was that he was great in bed. Notice that I said "was?" 

"And I took it away? How did I do that?" 

"Don't play the innocent with me Frank. We both know who did a number on Stan's private parts." 

"I don't have a clue as to what you are talking about." 

"Sure you don't. Anyway, ever since you did whatever it was that you did to him he has not been able to get it up and don't give me any of that crap about not knowing what I'm talking about. Wallets in the mail are kind of your trademark." 

Just then the waitress walked up to take our order. As Arlis ordered a salad and ice tea I gave her a good once over. Yes indeed, her husband was an idiot not to have stayed home. As well as being gorgeous Arlis was pretty sharp as I quickly found out. 

"Well?" she asked. 

"Well what?" 

"Do I pass?" 

"What are you talking about now?" 

"What? I wasn't supposed to notice you checking me out just now?" 

I was caught and I knew it so I just gave her a goofy smile and said, "Who? Me?" 

"Yes you and I hope you like what you see because the real reason for this little get together is to offer it to you." 

I don't know what the look on my face was saying to her, but she went on: 

"I am a very sexual person with a very high sex drive and since you have taken my play toy away from me I feel that it is only fair that you take over his duties." 

That caught me flat-footed and I didn't know what to say. She smiled at me and said: 

"I'll bet you weren't expecting that one were you?" 

"To be honest, it never entered my mind." 

"Well Frank, here is the way I see it. You deprived me of my bed partner so it is only fair that you take his place and second, what can be a more fitting way to get back at your wife and my husband?" 

"I don't know Arlis. The package is outstanding, but I don't know that it is a good idea. The situation that I'm in right now could be upset if I give Diane grounds to sue for divorce." 

"You aren't divorcing her?" 

I explained what I was doing and she laughed. "You are evil aren't you, but not to worry. I don't intend to broadcast it. If Stan never gets the use of his equipment back I'll divorce him and I don't want him to have grounds to counter sue either." 

"You are serious about this?" 

"You betcha!" 

And that is how my Affair with Arlis North started. It has been going on for over a year now and it doesn't show any sign of ending any time soon. Her husband still hasn't been able to get an erection. The doctors say there is no physical reason for him not to be able to perform so his problem is probably mental. Arlis says she will give him until the end of the year and then if he still can't get it up he will be history. 

As far as I know Diane hasn't been seeing anyone, but she is well aware that I'm seeing someone, but she has no idea who. The knowledge that I am having sex with another woman is killing her, but she keeps hanging on hoping for a miracle that is never going to come. 

I couldn't ask for better revenge.  

===

It started when my cousin Tom set up a bachelor party for his brother, my cousin James. I was invited and I of course accepted and said I would be there. This did not set well with my wife Doris. Doris had an extremely low opinion of bachelor parties because of what she had seen on her side of the family. 

Her brother Sam had attended one, had partaken of the offer made by the hired stripper to 'entertain' anyone with the proper amount of cash and had ended up with a case of VD which he was unable to adequately explain to his wife. Her cousin Ron had left his wife and two children and had run off with the hired entertainment at a bachelor party that he had attended. Her father had gotten drunk at a bachelor party and had wrecked his car and put himself in the hospital for a week. No indeed, Doris was not at all happy with me for accepting the invitation. 

I pointed out that she had gone to a bachelorette party or two where they had male strippers come in and she said that was different. 

"In what way?" 

"There is no way a male stripper can do what a female stripper does at a man's bachelor party." 

"Explain that to me please." 

"A female stripper can take her panties off, lay back and take on every man there until they are done. So guys are more likely to take advantage of the opportunity. A male stripper at a girl's party can only go once or maybe twice so since they can't all be helped girls tend to behave themselves." 

"Do you have any idea of how stupid that sounds?" 

"It is a well known fact that women can control themselves and men can't." 

"Do you know just how stupid THAT sounds?" 

"I don't want to fight over this Frank. I don't want you going to Jim's bachelor party. Take him out to dinner or something, but I don't want you going to that party." 

"What you are saying Doris is that you don't trust me. After two years of going together, two years of living together and eight years of marriage you don't know me any better than that? Well I'm going Doris and that's final." 

It wasn't of course. There were still nine days to go before the party and Doris used those nine days to do whatever she could to get me not to go. Things were pretty chilly around the house as she pretty much ignored me. Her big gun of course was her control of the little furry patch between her legs. We normally made love three or four times a week, but for nine days all I heard was: 

"Not tonight Frank. I'm not feeling well." 

There was also the perennial favorite, "Not tonight; I've got a headache." 

It was clear to me that if I did go the dry spell could continue long after the party was a memory, but I can be just as stubborn and pig headed as Doris and I was going and that was final. We lived in a state where spousal rape was not a crime and I could have just taken what I wanted, but the aftermath of that wasn't worth contemplating. 

I was able to strike back all be it in a limited way. Every Friday night I always – without fail – took Doris out to dinner. Friday when I came home from work Doris was dressed and ready to go out. I went into the bedroom that I had turned into a home office/den, sat down at the desk and turned on the computer. When I didn't come down dressed for dinner Doris came looking for me. She came into the room and said: 

"What are you doing? Why aren't you getting ready for dinner?" 

"I'm too busy cruising the Internet looking for some good porn sites. 

"You are what?" 

"Looking for some good porn. I'm horny as hell since you cut me off and I'm looking for some good material that I can use to masturbate to. You can watch if you'd like." 

The slamming of the door as she left pretty much told me that she wasn't interested in being a spectator. 

Saturday I was up and out of the house before Doris woke up. I had a standing golf date with three friends every Saturday and our tee time was ten after six and Doris wouldn't get up until eight or so. She had a standing appointment at the beauty parlor at eleven and she would usually just be coming home as I got in from my round of golf at Red Ridge. Doris was going to miss her appointment that morning because I took her car instead of my pick up. Her car had an automatic transmission and my truck was a stick and Doris couldn't drive a stick shift. I know it doesn't sound like much in the way of fighting back, but when you are 'game playing' you have to take what you can get. 

To say that Doris was pissed off when I got home would be an understatement. I ignored her and got ready to go to Jim's bachelor party. I got one last "Damn it Frank; I told you I don't want you going to that party" and I ignored her as I walked out of the house, got in my truck and headed for the party. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was your typical bachelor party. There were seventeen guys there and I knew and liked most of them. I say most because Mel Timmonds was there and I didn't like him one little bit. He had always had the hots for Doris and he had tried several times to break us up before we got married. 

There were three tables set up for poker. It was nickel, dime, quarter, dealer's choice with a three raise limit so no one was going to get hurt. Two hours into the game (which was being held in Jim's apartment) the doorbell rang and Tom answered it to find two female cops standing there. One said: 

"Your neighbors are complaining about the noise. Whose place is this?" 

Tom pointed to Jim and the two walked over to Jim and quick as a wink one of them slapped handcuffs on him as she said: 

"You are under arrest." 

The cuffs were real and not fake. One of the cops began to read Jim his rights, the "You have the right to remain silent" and all that jazz. Until that point everyone thought the girls were strippers. I could tell from the look on Tom's face that he hadn't been expecting it and a close look at their uniforms seemed to tell that they weren't fake. Everyone was starting to worry about what was happening until the one reading Jim his rights said: 

"You have the right to have a hard cock when Missy gives you a lap dance" and as she said that she took a mini cassette recorder out of her pocket and stripper type music began the play as the other lady cop started peeling off her uniform. From that point on it was just the kind of bachelor party that Doris had envisioned. The two girls took on every guy there who wanted to play and a couple of times both girls were doing three at once. I'd heard of 'airtight' and I knew what it was, but I had never seen it. It was wild and I'm not going to say that I wasn't tempted. 

But I didn't take it. I just watched the action and allowed myself to get all steamed up even knowing that my only outlet was going to be my right hand when I went home. I was watching Tom, Jim and Mark doing the one named Missy when Mel came up to me and said: 

"You aren't going to play?" 

"Nope. No way! If I did and Doris found out she would throw me out on my ear. You know, the marriage vow thing and all that." 

"Tough luck guy; these are two choice ladies and they know what they are doing. I've never had better." 

He went over to the other girl, Donna was her name, and since she had an open hole Mel promptly filled it. As I watched I had to wonder why I didn't just say "To hell with Doris" and join in. I mean I was a man and I needed sex and Doris wouldn't give me any and I was in an apartment with two girls who would. It wouldn't be 'love' and there would be no emotional involvement. It would just be sex for the sake of sex so why not? A couple of times I caught myself reaching for my zipper or belt buckle, but at the last second I stopped myself. 

Shortly before the party started breaking up both girls came up to me and Missy said: 

"What's the matter honey; don't either of us appeal to you?" 

"Just the opposite. I'm dying to take on both of you, but unfortunately I have a character flaw." 

"A character flaw?" asked Donna. "What kind of character flaw?" 

"There is this silly thing inside my head that says I have to stay faithful to my wife." 

"Really" Donna said, "I didn't think there were any good guys left out there. I'm going to have to give you my number in case your wife is ever silly enough to let you get away." 

"That goes double for me honey" Missy said, "I would love to have a guy who thinks like that." 

Tom and am came up and took them by the arm and led them away and as I watched two delightful asses walk away from me I was thinking, "You do gangbangs at parties and you want a guy like me? Go figure." 

The party started breaking up and soon it was down to just Tom, Jim, the two girls and me. I was reasonably sober so I stuck around to help with the clean up. Donna and Missy came up to me and Donna said: 

"You have to at least give us a kiss sugar" and Missy giggled and said, "No charge of course." They both kissed me and both of them did slip me a piece of paper with their phone numbers on them. Donna said: 

"I meant what I said sugar. If your wife is dumb enough to let you go call me." 

The two of them left and Tom, who had been the money collector for the two said: 

"I should have been born a sexy looking babe. Those two just spent four hours thoroughly enjoying themselves and they walked out of here with twenty-three hundred dollars to split between them and that doesn't even count the four hundred they got for coming here to do the strip tease. That's almost three hundred and forty dollars an hour." 

We cleaned the place up and I left, but the night wasn't over for me yet. When I got outside I found the two girls standing in front of a Ford Focus with the hood up. I walked up and asked: 

"Got a problem?" 

"It won't start." 

I went to my truck, got the flashlight from the glove box and came back to take a look. 

"You girls are out of luck tonight" I said. "Your positive battery cable terminal is corroded and split in half. There aren't any parts houses open at this time of night so the car is dead until tomorrow." 

"Shit!" Missy said. Now what?" 

"We call a cab" Donna said. 

"At this time of night? We will be here for hours." 

"No you won't" I said. "I'll run you to where you need to go. I don't work tomorrow so I'll hit a parts store, get what is needed to fix it and we can come back and get it going." 

"Oh God; you are a life saver sugar" Donna said and we got in my truck and I ran them home. 

It turned out that it was Donna's car, but they were roommates so I only had one place to drive to. When I got them to their place I made arrangements to swing by and pick Donna up in the morning at ten. 

When I got home I found the bedroom door locked. I remembered a John Wayne movie where his wife had locked him out of the bedroom and he had kicked the door down as he yelled, "There will be no locked doors in this house" and I briefly contemplated doing the same thing, but reason prevailed. If I kicked it in I'd be the one repairing or replacing it and unless I was going to commit spousal rape there wasn't anything on the other side of the door for me except the bed and the living room couch was just as comfortable. 

Comfortable couch or not I was not in a good mood when I got up that morning. Doris was still in bed so I fixed myself some breakfast and I was sitting at the table eating when Doris came into the room. She looked around and then said: 

"Where's mine?" 

"You haven't fixed it yet" I said as I got up and put my dirty dishes into the dishwasher and headed for the door to the garage. 

"Where are you going Frank? 

"To pick up Donna and then go over to Jim's place and fix her car." 

"Who is Donna?" 

"One of the strippers from last night." 

"You are going to pick up a stripper? I suppose you fucked her last night huh? Going back for more?" she sneered. 

"What do you care? You don't want to give me any so what's it to you?" And then, because I'm male and males can be inherently stupid around females I let my mouth run away. "And it brings up a thought Doris. You like sex as much as I do so you must be hurting just as much as I am. Or are you? Maybe you aren't suffering at all. Maybe you have a boyfriend on the side to keep you happy while you are keeping me miserable. Is that it Doris? You been hanging horns on me?" 

I could see the shock on her face as I unloaded and it did my heart good. 

"Got to go. Donna expects me at ten." 

I headed for the door. 

"Frank? You get your ass back here. We need to talk. We need to settle this now." 

"The only thing we need Doris is for you to apologize for being an absolute bitch for the last two weeks." 

I walked out into the garage and got my cable cutting tool and my cable swagger from my tool box and then went to pick up Donna. We hit a parts store and got the terminal end we needed and then drove over to Jim's place to fix her car. 

On the way she asked me why I looked so sour and I was just in the right mood to tell her the entire story. 

"So on top of her disliking bachelor parties she thinks you strayed last night?" 

"That pretty much sums it up." 

"You want me to call her and tell her what actually happened?" 

"God no! That would only make it worse. She would figure that I put you up to it and that you were lying for me. As it is she thinks I with you now to have more sex." 

"All I can say sugar, is that if things go south between the two of you give me a call." She looked at me for a second or so and then said, "But you won't, will you. I'm just a whore and who wants anything to do with a whore, right?" 

"Don't be stupid Donna. You are a lovely woman and you seem likeable. I'm betting that we could be real good friends, but as long as I'm married it can never be any more than that. That includes any split that comes between me and my wife. I will not break my wedding vows as long as I'm still legally married to my wife. If a divorce does happen and you are still around you will be one of the first I call." 

She gave me another long look and then said, "I do believe that you mean that." 

"I do sweetie; I do." 

She leaned over and kissed me. "I haven't met very many really nice guys in my life sugar, but you go to the top of the list of the few that I know." 

We got to Jim's and I fixed her car and waited until she started and drove off before heading home. When I got home Doris wasn't there. I went out to the garage and did an oil change on the truck and when Doris still wasn't home I fixed myself some leftovers, ate and then settled down in front of the TV. 

Doris came in about seven and didn't say a word as she walked through the house and into the kitchen. I heard her rattling around as she fixed herself something to eat and about twenty minutes later she came into the living room and stood there with her hands on her hips as she said: 

"Want to know where I've been?" 

I looked over at her and said, "No." 

"Maybe I've been out looking for a stud since you have a stripper." 

You need to understand my mindset at that moment. She had been a bitch to me for almost two weeks and had cut me off to try and force me to do what she wanted. I was pissed and I'd had enough so I said: 

"I doubt that you were looking. Most likely you were just out fucking the guy that you have been fucking ever since you cut me off." 

I looked back at the TV as she yelled, "You bastard! How can you think that of me?" 

"It is just as easy for me to think that of you as it is for you to think that of me. Besides, didn't you just say you were out looking?" 

She turned and left the room and I went back to watching TV. I decided to get to bed early to avoid the locked door again and I was in bed reading when Doris came into the bedroom. 

"I don't want you in here with me" she said. 

"Tough shit Doris. I slept on the couch last night so if you don't want to be in here with me you can sleep on the couch tonight." 

She left the room and slammed the door behind her. 

I was up and gone to work before Doris woke up and I rather liked the fact that I could start my day without having more bad words with her. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got home from work that evening as I pulled into the drive I saw a bunch of stuff scattered across the front yard. When I got out of the truck I could see that it was my clothes. My clothes!! In fact, it looked like all my clothes were on the lawn. What the fuck was Doris doing now? 

The door was locked so I pt my house key in the lock and it wouldn't work. I went around back and tried that door. Same thing. Doris had locked me out of the house. That was it!!! The straw that broke the camel's back. I went back to the truck and got the tire iron from behind the seat and walked back up on the porch. Since it was Doris who was going to have to clean up the mess I used the tire iron on the large picture window and then I went into the house. I grabbed a bunch of garbage bags and went out and gather up all my clothes and put them in the back of the truck. 

I went through the house and took everything that I wanted. I had a separate savings account that I put ten percent of my pay into every payday to save money for vacations so before I unhooked the computer I went online and transferred everything out of our savings and checking accounts into the vacation account that Doris didn't have access to. I used the phone to call and cancel all of our credit cards and I only kept the American Express that was in my name only that I used for business travel. 

I don't know what Doris thought she was doing, but she should have known that I wouldn't sit still for it. Lock me out of the house will she? Let's just see how she likes living alone with no credit and no money except for what she made at her job. 

I drove away from the house and headed for a motel close to work. I was just carrying the last of my stuff into the motel room when my cell phone rang. I looked at the display and saw that it wasn't Doris so I took the call. 

"Hello?" 

"Frank? This is Ray Hendrickson. I may be sticking my nose into something that's none of my business but I thought I'd let you know that Doris is at The Hitching Post with Mel Timmonds and they are being pretty chummy." 

"Define chummy for me Ray." 

"They are sitting side by side in one of the back booths. Mel has his arm around her and he was nuzzling her neck. She wasn't doing anything to fight him off." 

"Thanks for the heads up Ray. I appreciate it." 

So the cunt was finally giving Mel what he had always been after. Well fuck her! 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got to work the next morning Stella, our receptionist, had several messages for me. Three of them were from Doris and I dropped them in the trash without reading them. I told Stella that I didn't want to take calls from Doris and to tell her I was in a meeting or out of the office. 

"Then again you can just tell her that I told you that under no circumstances did I want to hear her voice and I told you not to put her through." 

"Trouble on the home front?" 

"Not for much longer." 

About ten o'clock things slowed down enough that I could get on the phone and call a friend who had just gone through a divorce and I got the name of the attorney he used. I called and made an appointment for the next day. I wasn't quite ready for the divorce yet, but I did want to know what I was looking at if push came to shove. 

There was a bar across the street from the motel and before going to my room I stopped in and had a few beers and watched the basketball game that was on their TV. I had no interest in either team, but it did give me something to do. 

The next day I got the bad news from the attorney. We lived in what was called 'a no fault' state so any divorce was going to result in an even split of assets and since I made almost twice what Doris did I was going to have to pay her alimony. Also, since I would be the one filing I would, along with my attorney's fees be responsible for all court costs. In addition to that if Doris fought the divorce I could, depending on the judge, get hit with having to pay her attorney fees. The only thing I had going for me was that we had no kids.  

===

That information kind of cooled me down. In the long run it would be cheaper to just stay married, but not live together. If Doris didn't like it then she could file and at least then I wouldn't get stuck with court costs and her attorney fees. I left the attorney's office determined to find a reasonable apartment close to work and move on with my life. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

"Good morning. Thank you for calling Benton and Associates. How may I direct your call?" 

"Dorie? This is Steph." 

"Hi Steph. What's up?" 

"Is every thing okay with you and Frank?" 

"Why do you ask?" 

"You know I work in the Marston Building right? This morning I saw Frank coming out of Tucker Davidson's office." 

"Why call me about that?" 

"Tucker is a divorce attorney." 

"Oh shit!" 

"Not good huh?" 

"Not good at all. I've got six lines blinking so I have to go. Can you meet me for lunch at Maxine's? Say noonish or there about?" 

"Will do." 

After the waitress had taken their order Doris asked, "Does this Tucker guy do anything else besides divorce?" 

"No. His practice is strictly family law and that pretty much means divorces. You and Frank having problems." 

"Kind of." 

"It has to be a little more than "kind of" if Frank is talking to Tucker." 

Doris told Steph about what had been going on." 

"You have to be kidding me Dorie. As long as you have been with Frank and you don't know him any better than that? Frank would no more take part in something like that than you would pull a train at a frat house. 

"But he did. Mel Timmonds called me and told me." 

"Mel did what?" 

"He called me and told me what Frank did." 

"Why would he do that?" 

"He was always trying to get with me, but I was with Frank and when I married Frank Mel told me that some day I would be sorry that I picked Frank over him. He called me to gloat. Told me that my so called loving husband was making it with two strippers." 

"And you believed him?" 

"Frank confirmed it the next morning. He told me he was going to meet one of the strippers and he walked out of the house." 

"That doesn't sound like the Frank that I know." 

Doris told Steph just how things had gone that morning and Steph said: 

"And you didn't give him the benefit of the doubt that what he was telling you was true? That he was just helping some one with a car problem?" 

"Why would I after hearing what Mel had to say?" 

"So after a phone call you tossed Frank under the bus." 

"It was more than a phone call Mel said he had pictures. After Frank left to go to the stripper I met Mel at Denny's and he described the entire evening to me. There were two strippers and Frank did both of them a couple of times. Mel must have believed that I didn't believe him so he told me had pictures and if I would meet him at the Hitching Post the next night he would show them to me." 

"Why didn't he show them to you at Denny's?" 

"He had put his phone on the charger and didn't have it with him. Frank was home when I got back from seeing Mel and I made Frank wonder if I was late coming home because I was out looking for some one to get even with. I shouldn't have done that because then Frank accused me of cheating on him for weeks. I ended up sleeping on the couch that night and I was so pissed in the morning I tossed all of Frank's clothes out onto the front lawn and then called a locksmith to change the locks on the house." 

"How did Frank take that?" 

"Not well. He broke a window to get into the house, took everything he wanted and left." 

"What did he say to you?" 

"I haven't been able to get in touch with him. He won't take my calls. I called a company to come and fix the window and when I paid the man with my credit card he told me it was declined and so I had to write him a check." 

"I hope you were smart enough to call the bank before you wrote the check. If Frank was pissed off enough to cancel your credit cards he might have cleaned out the bank accounts too." 

"Oh shit! This just keeps getting worse and worse." 

"What about Mel's pictures?" 

"I met him at the Hitching Post and he showed me two pictures. They showed Frank watching a couple of guys doing the stripper doggie. The only face you could see was Frank's. When I asked him if that was his proof he said no, but he wanted something before he would show me the good stuff." 

"Don't tell me; let me guess. He told you that you should let him help you get even with Frank and then he would show you the photos." 

"Well yes, I guess that is what he wanted." 

"And did you?" 

"Good Lord no! I did get a little touchy-feely with him to lead him on and get him to show me the rest of the pictures he had." 

"And did he?" 

"No. I wouldn't leave with him and go to his place so he wouldn't show them to me." 

"Did it not occur to you that he didn't show them to you because he didn't have any more? If he did he would have shown them to you to get you even more pissed off at Frank so that you would want to get even." 

"I didn't think of that." 

"Did you also not think about what you were doing? The Hitching Post is the hangout for most of Frank's friends. Did you not consider that one of them might see you getting all touchy-feely with Mel and call Frank and tell him? No wonder Frank was seeing Tucker. What it is Dorie is that I think you have managed to toss your marriage into the trash can." 

"I can't believe that Frank would do that." 

"Dorie honey; I'm not a man so I have no idea how a man would think after going through what you have just told me you've put Frank through, but if it had happened to me I'd be signing the divorce papers even as we speak. If I were you girlfriend I'd be finding some way to get to Frank before things get any more out of hand. Assuming that you want to keep him that is." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The intercom buzzed and I hit the button and said, "Yes?" 

"I know you told me not to take messages from your wife or put her through to you" Stella said, "But there has been a development that makes that impossible." 

"What development?" 

"She is standing here in front of me and she says she isn't leaving until she talks to you." 

"Tell her I'm busy and I'm not going to talk to her on company time." 

There was a pause and then Stella said, "She said to tell you she brought a book and she will sit here and read it until you are done for the day." 

I looked at my watch and saw that it was three hours until quitting time. What I was doing wasn't pressing and I could have gotten away early, but the mood I was in wasn't going to allow me to cut Doris any slack. I did need to take Stella out of the middle of things and I was going to have to talk to Doris sooner or later so I told Stella to tell Doris to enjoy her book. 

At four-fifteen I received a phone call from Doris' cousin and best friend Stephanie. 

"How are things going Frank?" 

"They have been better Steph. What can I do for you?" 

"I had lunch with Dorie today Frank and the girl is a mess. She told me what has been going on and while I agree that she has done some stupid shit I don't think it has reached the level of divorce." 

"Why do you bring up divorce?" 

"I saw you leaving Tucker Davidson's office and divorce is what Tucker does." 

"When she told you what has been going on did she mention the cheating part?" 

"She didn't cheat on you Frank. Timmonds told her he had compromising pictures of what you were doing at the stag party and he was trying to convince her that she should get even with you by screwing him. She led him on trying to get him to show her the pictures. She swears she never did anything with him and I believe her. You two need to sit down and talk Frank." 

"Maybe Steph, but there is more going on than whatever she might have done with Timmonds and I'm not sure that talking is going to do anything. But you are right; I am going to have to sit down and have it out with her sooner or later. Thanks for the concern Steph, but I'm busy and need to go." 

"Bye Frank. Good luck." 

"Thanks Steph." 

At five I saved my work, shut down the computer and went to face Doris. She looked up from her book as I entered the reception area and I noticed the worried look on her face. She stood up and I said: 

"I'll meet you at the Hitching Post. We can sit in the same booth where you were making out with Timmonds and have our talk there" and I walked on by her. I stopped at a gas station on the way and filled up so Doris beat me to the bar. She was sitting in one of the back booths and I remembered that Ray said that he had seen Doris and Timmonds in one of the back booths and I wondered if she was in that booth because she took me literally when I said we could talk in the booth where she had been with Mel. 

I walked over and sat down opposite Doris and when Alice came over to get our order I ordered a Bud and said: 

"Separate checks Alice." 

The look on my wife's face when I said that helped make my day. As Alice walked away I said: 

"Okay Doris; you called this meeting. Speak your piece." 

"Why did you cancel our credit cards and clean out our bank accounts?" 

"Oh come on Doris; you aren't stupid. You threw all my stuff out of the house and then had the locks changed to keep me out. That told me that you didn't want me around anymore. I can take a hint so I left and as long as I was going I wasn't going to support you and pay your bills so I cancelled the cards so you couldn't run them up. As for the money in the bank? You threw me out of the house so as far as I was concerned you get to help pay for wherever I end up living. Your share of the cash that was in the bank can help pay for my move. 

"Besides, you have the house and it is worth more that what was in the bank. Of course you also get to make the payments on it from now on and also you get to pay all the utilities. Might be tight on what you make, but what the hell, it is what you wanted right?" 

"No Frank, it is not what I wanted. I over-reacted to your going off to see that stripper after going to that party that I didn't want you to go to in the first place. It turned out just like I knew it would. A drunken orgy." 

"So what does that have to do with me? Just because it happened and I was there does that mean that I had any part of it? How about when you stop for drinks after work with the girls you work with? I know for a fact that Linda Bliss and Joyce Baker go out to the parking lot with guys they meet at the bar and spend time on back seats. Because you are there with them does that mean you do some back seat playing too?" 

"That's different." 

"No it isn't Doris. You are saying that I am guilty because I was there when it happened so that means that you are guilty if you are there when Linda and Joyce do their thing. I didn't do a damned thing with the two strippers that were there other than give them a ride home when their car wouldn't start. I went back the next day and fixed her car for her. All I got out of it was a kiss on the cheek and a thank you and that was fine with me because it was all I expected. And before you asked I did it because they were in trouble and I was there and could help. I've done the same for other people. Just because they were strippers I should have turned my back on them?" 

"Why didn't you explain that to me?" 

"Why would I waste my breath Doris? You haven't listened to a word I've said for the last two weeks so why would I expect you to listen to me explain anything to you." 

"Okay Frank; I'll eat crow and admit I was wrong to do what I did." 

She opened her purse, took out an envelope and slid it across the table to me. 

"What is it?" 

"A key to the new locks so you can come home." 

I pushed it back to her and said, "I don't think so Doris. The bachelor party and the thing with the strippers is only part of the problem. There are other things I am not happy about. One of them is that I'm sick and tired of you withholding sex whenever you want to try and make me bend to your will. Another is that I'm not sure I want to live with a woman who I think cheats on me. I meant what I said Sunday morning. You like sex as much as I do and you didn't seem to be suffering after not giving me any for two weeks so I have to wonder if in fact you were going without. I think I know the answer to that after hearing about you and Mel Timmonds. And I have not forgotten that you strongly hinted at the fact that you were out looking for cock when you came home late Sunday evening and as far as I know you managed to find one before coming home. I really don't see any reason for me to come home Doris." 

"Damn it Frank! You should know me better than that. I was pissed at you and I was jerking your chain. I would never cheat on you." 

"That's not what I hear. My information is that Mel Timmonds helped you 'get even with me' for what you believed that I had done at the bachelor party." 

"I didn't do a damned thing with Mel. Well, maybe I did do a few things to lead him on. He said he had pictures of you fucking the girls at the party and asked me if I wanted to see them and I of course said yes." 

"And did you see pictures of me fucking some girls?" 

"All he had were two pictures of you standing there watching. He said he had some that were a lot more explicit, but I wasn't willing to give him what he wanted to show them to me. I did kiss him twice and I didn't slap his hands away when he copped some feels, but that was all." 

"You have any way to prove that Doris?" 

She thought for a moment and then said, "I think I do. Your friend Ronny Thomas and his wife were there and I stopped and said hi to them as I was leaving. They can tell you that I left alone and that Mel was still there when I left." 

"How do I know that you didn't meet him later? How do I know that you didn't leave alone just to throw my friends off? You know what I'm saying. "I'll leave first Mel so no one sees us leave together. I'll meet you at your place." How do I know that isn't the way it went?" 

"God damn it Frank! What do you want? You want me to take a lie detector test? Fine! Set it up and I will do it." 

"So tell me Doris; how does it feel to deny that something happened and not be believed?" 

"It sucks Frank." 

"A minute ago you said that I should know you better than to believe some of what I said. Shouldn't you have known me better also? All the years we have been together and you didn't trust me any more than you did?" 

"I'm sorry Frank and looking back from this point I can see that I wasn't being very rational. There was every thing that I knew about the disastrous results that bachelor parties had on people that I knew and I just didn't want you to go. Yes, I should have known you better, but in the back of my mind there was the thought that any man, even a good man, would lose it when exposed to a naked woman willing to take on any one there. When you said that you were going to see that stripper Sunday morning it just confirmed all my fears. All I could think about was Ron leaving his wife and kids and running off with that stripper he met at a bachelor party. I was crushed Frank and you didn't make it any better. When I snapped at you you should have known how I felt. Why didn't you tell me to go with you if I thought you were going to do something wrong? Why didn't you say "Come and see for yourself" instead of taking off and leaving there thinking what I was thinking?" 

"So now it is my fault Doris? I'm not buying it. Everything that has happened has been because of your actions. The fact that you pushed and pushed and it finally forced me to get my back up and push back does not make it my fault." 

"Can't we just put all this behind us Frank? I love you and I need you with me. Please Frank, take the key and come home" and as she pushed the envelope with the key in it back to me she looked up and said: 

"Hi Brenda." 

I looked back over my shoulder and saw my favorite stripper standing there. She smiled at me and said: 

"Hi Frank." 

Doris looked from me to Brenda and then back to me and asked, "You two know each other?" 

'Yes" I said, "And I take it that you know each other?" 

"Brenda works with me. Actually that isn't really true. I work for her since she is the office manager." 

I motioned for Brenda to join us and she sat down next to Doris and opposite me. 

"I didn't mean to intrude, but when I came in and saw two of my favorite people sitting together I just had to come over and say hi." 

"Frank is one of your favorite people? How is it that you know my husband?" 

Brenda looked at me in surprise. "You and Dorie?" 

I nodded a yes. The "How do you know my husband" hung in the air between us and my mind went into overdrive. Obviously Doris did not know Brenda worked nights as a stripper which told me that Brenda probably didn't want Doris or anyone else in the office to know so how to answer the question? I really didn't know Brenda or enough about Brenda to chance telling a lie that might easily be seen through so I decided that Brenda was going to have to field the question. I looked at Brenda with what I hoped was "Answer the question" on my face and I guess she caught it or had arrived at the same conclusion I had and decided that it was the way to go. 

Brenda laughed and said, "I tried to steal Frank from his wife and he wouldn't give me a tumble. Here I am thinking that I'm one of the most beautiful and sexy women in this state and he wouldn't even let me give him my phone number." 

"You tried to steal my husband?" 

"I didn't know he was your husband. In fact he was wearing gloves so I couldn't see a ring and so I didn't know he was married. What happened was that Marsha and I were in here for drinks and some stupid idiot who had too much to drink decided that he was God's gift to women and me in particular and he kept trying to get me to dance with him. I kept saying no and he finally got verbally abusive. He said a bunch of really upsetting things and I finally got mad enough to throw a drink in his face. He raised his hand to hit me and Frank just happened to be walking by on his way out and he stepped in, grabbed the guy, subdued him and walked him out the door and into the parking lot. I heard him tell the guy that if he tried to come back in he would hurt him and then stuff him in the dumpster. 

"Then he came back in and offered to walk Marsha and me to our cars to make sure that the idiot wouldn't bother us when we left. So there he was. A Knight in Shining Armor doing good deeds for a damsel in distress and he just happened to be an absolute hunk besides so I threw myself at him and he just smiled, said he was glad to help, wished me a good night and left. He did let me buy him a drink the next time I saw him in here, but try as I might that was as far as I was able to get with him. Of course it was probably a good thing he turned me down because Marsha wanted him too and we would have ended up fighting over him and would probably have ended up not being roommates any more." 

"Marsha wanted my husband too? I guess I'll have to pour water on her head at work. You get a pass because it wouldn't be smart to screw with the boss." 

"Good thinking girlfriend. Now that I see you two together I can see why I couldn't entice him so I don't feel so bad at being turned down." 

While we were talking the band was setting up and when their first number started Brenda asked: 

"Mind if I dance with my hero?" 

I was pretty sure that Doris minded, but I guess she didn't want to say no to her boss so I was not surprised when she said she wouldn't mind. When I took Brenda in my arms to start the waltz I said: 

"Nice save Donna, or is it really Brenda?" 

"It is Brenda. I don't use my real name when I'm working parties." 

"I guess that means that Missy is really Marsha?" 

"That's right. Jesus Frank; I had no idea that you were Dorie's husband."  

===

"Why would you." You have never seen us together." 

"As much as she talks about you I should have recognized you just from her descriptions. Things any better between you since we last talked?" 

"Actually things are worse" and I told her what had gone on since I last saw her and she was shocked. 

"That's not the Doris I know. Believe me on this Frank; she would never cheat on you. When she talks about you at work it makes all the other girls mad." 

"Why in the hell would the other women get mad?" 

"Because according to Dorie you can do no wrong. According to her you can walk on water." 

"Why would you be talking about me anyway?" 

"It usually isn't about you. During one of our breaks a girl will be bitching about something her husband and boyfriend did and the other girls will jump in and talk about their men folk. Then Dorie puts in her two cents worth. That girl thinks you hung the moon and stars Frank. No way she would ever cheat on you. Get pissed and pull your chain? Probably, but cheat? Not in this lifetime." 

"I don't know Brenda. Her tone of voice and the way she said what she said didn't sound at all like she was trying to pull my chain." 

"I don't stop very often with the crew after work because I usually have an appointment if you take my meaning, but when I do stop with them all of us girls get hit on and Dorie has never danced more than once with any of the guys who have asked her. A few of the girls have even made trips out to the parking lot and Dorie gives them disgusted looks when they do. She won't even talk to Joyce and Linda because Linda and Joyce cheat on their husbands. There is no way that woman would cheat Frank. Absolutely no way. Whatever problems you are having Dorie's cheating on you isn't one of them." 

The music stopped and as we were walking back to the booth Brenda said: 

"I'm going to piss your wife off when we get back to the booth. And when I do I want you to think of this. Dorie is my friend, but if you can't work things out with her I was dead serious when I told you to give me a call." 

We got to the booth and she did give me a kiss on the lips and then she picked up her purse and said she had to be going and then she said to Doris: 

"Take good care of my hero. I'll see you at work." 

I sat down and Doris said, "You turned her down? She was kidding when she said she was one of the most beautiful and sexy women in this state, but the fact is that she is just that and you turned her down?" 

"Of course I did. I'm a married man and I made some promises in a church and in front of a hundred people and I honor my promises even if some others don't." 

"God damn it Frank! I told you I would take a lie detector test if I have to. I did not cheat on you!" 

"Here is my take on it Doris. You created this mess so if it gets cleaned up you get to be the one to clean it up." 

I got up to leave and she said, "What do you mean Frank? Where are you going? We need to settle this Frank. You need to come home." 

"Think on it some Doris; maybe you will figure it out." 

I left the bar and went to my room. As I was emptying my pockets onto the dresser I saw that I had picked up the envelope with the key in it that Doris had tried to give me. Was it a sign? 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next two days were busy ones for me. I had to fly to Denver for a series of meetings and they were very productive. The outcome could lead to a nice bonus for me. I was in a good mood when I flew back home and I decided to treat myself to a celebratory dinner at my favorite steak house. 

I had been there about ten minutes when Brenda, Marsha and two men came in and were seated on the other side of the room from me. Brenda looked around the room, saw me, gave me a big smile and turned and said something to Marsha. Marsha looked over, waved and gave me a smile. I thought that the two men had to be the luckiest guys in the world to get to have those two and I wondered at why I was internally wired they way I was. I could have had both of them and had taken a pass. That thought reminded me that it had almost a month since I had been laid and it looked like it was going to be a good bit longer for me. 

I was just finishing my dessert when Brenda got up and came over to my table. "Come on over and join us Frank." 

"I wouldn't want to intrude on your dates." 

"They aren't dates Frank. It is more of a business meeting. They are setting up a bachelor party and we are having dinner with them while working out the details. I pointed you out as a satisfied customer and they asked me to invite you over. I think they want to ask you if we are worth what we gave them as far as price is concerned." 

"I didn't partake of the delights Brenda so how would I know?" 

"You saw it all Frank. Did you see disappointment on anyone's face? 

"No, not even a little bit." 

"You don't have to tell them you didn't play. Just say that everyone there had the time of their life." 

"I suppose I could do that." 

I joined the group, answered the questions I was asked and apparently the men were satisfied. One of them picked up the check and they both stood up to leave. The one named Don said as he shook hands with Brenda and Marsha "We will see you Friday at seven" and then both men left. 

"Okay Frank" Marsha said, "Now you are alone with two hot babes who want your body so what are you going to do?" 

"Go back to my room and cry." 

"Why would you do that?" 

"Look ladies; if I was single I'd kill to be able to have either one of you, but I'm married and it is something that I take seriously. Cheating on my wife is something I will not do." 

I saw Marsha give Brenda a look that I couldn't decipher and Brenda said: 

"You can at least sit with us and have a drink or two." 

"Yes, I can do that." 

I had two drinks with them and then called it a night. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

I spent some time thinking about the situation with Doris and by the end of the next day I decided to swing by the house and talk some more with Doris. I was pretty sure that she was telling the truth about Timmonds, but we still needed to talk about her bad habit of cutting me off whenever she didn't get her way. 

I used my new key to let myself in and as I came through the front door I heard Doris talking in the kitchen. I hadn't figured on there being any one there with here and I was all set to turn and leave when I realized that she had the phone on speaker which was something she sometimes did when she was working in the kitchen. The voice on the other end of the phone sounded like Brenda so I stopped where I was and listened. 

"If you and Marsha couldn't tempt him I doubt that the strippers at that bachelor party got to him." 

"I guess that it is confession time girlfriend. The story I gave you the other night about how I met Frank was pure bullshit. The truth is that Marsha and I were the strippers at that party and the story that Frank gave you was one hundred percent true. Our car wouldn't start and he gave us a ride home and then he came back the next morning and fixed the car. Marsha and I pretty much threw ourselves at him and all he would let me do was kiss him on the cheek. He was in a downer of a mood and I asked him why and I guess he felt the need to unload and he told me about how things were going between him and his wife. I did tell him that if he couldn't work things out with his wife to give me a call. Of course then I didn't know you were his wife. You have gold there girlfriend and you need to do whatever it takes to keep him." 

"My problem is that I painted myself into a corner and now I'm screwed." 

"How so?" 

"I told him I would take a lie detector test to prove I wasn't lying when I told him that I hadn't cheated on him with Mel. I expected that he would say no need. I mean why would I offer if I had anything to hide right? The thing is that he told me that since I was the one who made the mess that it was up to me to clean it up. I took that to mean that I should set things up and take the test." 

"So do it." 

"I can't. It would show that I wasn't lying when I said that I didn't do anything with Mel, but you can bet all the money you have that one of the questions would be "Have you ever cheated on your husband" and we both know I couldn't get by that one." 

"Why not?" 

"Have you forgotten the three parties I worked with you way back when?" 

"Oh wow. Yeah, I had forgotten them, but they were over six years ago." 

"But I was married when I did them and the question would be "Have you ever cheated on your husband." I've backed myself into a corner. Now Frank is expecting me to take a test and I don't dare. I lose either way. If I take it I can't pass it and if I don't take it Frank will assume that I haven't because I knew I couldn't pass it. I'm screwed either way I go." 

"I never did ask at the time, but why did you stop? You were definitely a hit with the men and you seemed to enjoy it." 

"I did more that enjoy it. I loved it. I loved it so much that I wanted to do more of it, but I knew if I kept at it sooner or later Frank would have found out. I didn't matter how much I loved it and wanted it. It would have cost me Frank and I couldn't let that happen. He means the world to me." 

"If you feel that way why did you do a party in the first place?" 

"Frank had been gone for over three months on a project and wasn't going to be coming home for another two or three months and I was horny as hell. I was climbing walls and hearing you and Marsha talk about the fun you were having at the parties that you did made it worse. You made it sound so exciting I volunteered to help. It was mind blowing Bren and I still think about it and wish I could do it, but it was a choice between it and Frank and Frank is always going to win when I have choices to make. Oh God Bren; what am I going to do? I can't lose Frank. I just can't." 

"You aren't going to like hearing this girlfriend, but you are right; you have backed yourself into a corner and the only hope I can see for you is to confess. I haven't known Frank all that long and I obviously don't know don't know him well, but he strikes me as the kind of guy who appreciates honesty. I also get the feeling from the way he acted when I threw myself at him that he loves you one hell of a lot. If I were you I would sit down with him and tell all. You are where you have nothing to lose by trying. If there is anyway I can help you let me know. Got to go. I'll see you tomorrow at work." 

I quietly left the house and returned to my motel room. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

My Doris doing gangbangs at bachelor parties? I would never have believed it. Not in a million years! It certainly changed things. Doris apparently had not cheated on me with Timmonds, but she had cheated on me and big time at that. 

When I had gone back with my new key it had been my intention to try and repair the breach between us, but that overheard conversation changed it. Suddenly I didn't know what I was going to do. To hell with it! I wasn't going to sit in my room and go crazy thinking about it. I grabbed my keys and drove over to the Hitching Post. 

Two beers and three games of pool later I saw Mel Timmonds come in with a good looking redhead and I decided that I would try and ruin his evening. I waited until he and his lady took a seat and had their first drink delivered and then I walked over to their table. 

"What's up sperm breath? I understand you told my wife you had some pictures of me doing bad things at Jim's bachelor party. She said you told her that if she would fuck you you would show her the photos. How about you show them to me? I won't fuck you to get a look at them, but the mood I'm in I'm willing to fuck you up." 

"Buzz off Frank. I'm not scared of you." 

"That's good dick breath. If you were afraid of me you would avoid me and I wouldn't be able to get my hands on you. Win or lose Mel it doesn't matter as long as I can put some hurt on you." 

"Let's do this some other time Frank. I'm with some one now." 

I turned to look at the woman and said, "Let me tell you a little story. Dirt bag here has been trying to get into my wife's pants for years. Last week we were at a bachelor party for my cousin Jim and when it was over fart face here called my wife and told her he had photos of me cheating on her with the two strippers who were at the party. He told her that if she would screw him to get even with me he would show her the pictures. As a result we are now separated. Is this the kind of guy you want to spend your time with?" 

She looked at Timmonds and then back at me and said, "No, but I've got no way to get home if I walk away from him." 

"Sure you do. I'll be more than happy to give you a ride, but if you don't want to chance it with me I'll give you cab fare." 

"The problem is that I just got here and I've been looking forward to a night out." 

"Do you shoot pool?" 

"Yes." 

"Then come on over and join us at the pool tables. You can shoot pool with us and when the band gets here I think Dave, Jim and I can keep you on the dance floor until you feel like leaving." 

Without a word to Mel she stood up and said, "Let's go." 

I looked at Mel and said, "It isn't over between us Mel. Sooner or later we will manage to get together in a place where we don't have to worry about the cops being called and one other thing. Every time I see you in here with a girl I'm going to do the same thing that I just did." 

I turned and followed the redhead to the pool tables. Her name was Hanna and she was a lot of fun. Not a bad stick at the tables either. We shot pool until the band started and I asked her to dance. As we danced she asked me how much of what I'd said about Mel was true and I told her "All of it." 

"You and your wife work things out yet?" 

"Not yet and I don't know that we will." 

"So hooking up at me is getting back at Mel and you are hoping to get lucky to get back at your wife?" 

"Not at all. Screwing things up for Mel? Yes indeed, but regardless of what my wife has done I don't cheat. I meant what I said. A no strings attached ride home or if you want I'll pt you in a taxi. I will say that if I was divorced or at least separated and going for a divorce I would be after you like a duck after a june bug." 

"I think I believe you and that's weird, because I really haven't trusted married men all that much." 

The tune ended and for the next two hours Dave, Jim and I kept Hanna out on the dance floor and I noticed Mel off to the side taking pictures with his cell phone. I guessed that Doris would be getting a phone call from him. 

Around eleven Hanna said that she needed to be going as she had to work the next day. 

"Should I call you a taxi?" 

"No, I'll take you up on your offer of a ride." 

We talked as I drove her home and I learned she was a legal secretary and she had met Mel when he had come in for a consultation with one of the attorneys at her firm. 

"He seemed like a nice enough guy. Guess I'm not too good at spotting the bad ones." 

"I don't know. I'm prejudiced because of what he tried to do to my wife, but to be honest about it there are not too many guys who wouldn't try if they thought they could get lucky." 

"She's that hot?" 

"Don't forget I'm prejudiced." 

When I got her to her place she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek and handed me a piece of paper with her phone number on it. 

"I might not be too good at spotting the bad ones, but I'm dead on when it comes to spotting the good ones. If things don't work out for you give me a call." 

I drove off feeling pretty good. The feeling stayed with me until I got to my room. My cell went off just as I was opening the door. The display said it was Doris. I flipped it open and said: 

"Yes?" 

"I need to talk with you Frank. Can you come over after work to morrow?" 

"No. Can't make it tomorrow." 

"How about the day after?" 

"Yeah; I can do that." 

"Seven? I'll make dinner." 

"No dinner Doris, but I'll be there at seven." 

I could have made the next day, but I had an idea that I knew what Doris was going to say and I had something that I wanted to do before talking with Doris. I dug through my wallet and found the piece of paper I was looking for. I stared at it for several seconds as I asked myself if I really wanted to do it and decided that yes, I did. Even though it was kind of late to be making a phone call I dialed the number. When she answered I said: 

"I need a huge favor Brenda." 

She was waiting in a booth at the back. As I sat down she said: 

"Okay Frank, you have my undivided attention. You said that I might be able to help you put things back together again with Doris. I'm all ears sugar. What can I do?" 

"You can tell me everything that you know about Doris. Skip all the good stuff; I just want to hear the bad. It's the bad that I have to get by." 

"I don't know about that kind of stuff." 

"Of course you do Brenda and you aren't going to help by lying. I know for a fact that you know about the three gang bangs she did at bachelor parties when I was up in Alaska for five months." 

Her face turned white. "You know about that?" 

"Indeed I do, but what I want to know is what is there that I don't know? What other things are there that I don't have a clue about. If I am going to get back together with Doris I'm going to have to grant amnesty, but I want to know just what I am pardoning. There will be no second chances. If she confesses like you suggested I want to hear it all and not just part of it. If she confesses and I find out later that there was some other stuff she didn't confess to we are done. I walk away and I don't look back. And if there is something else I'll find out sooner or later just like I found out about the bachelor parties." 

"How do you know I suggested she confess?" 

"Trade secret. Bottom line is that if she does confess I need to hear it all. If I grant forgiveness for what she tells me and find out later there was more it is over. So tell me about the bachelor parties and whatever else there is that you know." 

"What's to tell? You saw the one where we met and they are all pretty much the same. The only thing that changes is the faces." 

"How did she get involved?" 

"All the girls at work know what Marsha and I do. We never intended them to know, but Sandi's husband attended one of the parties and he took some pictures on his cell phone. Sandi discovered the pictures and recognized us. She showed the pictures to the girls in the office and our secret was out. The reaction was totally unexpected. Instead of treating us like freaks all the girls wanted to know what it was like. How did we get started? Why were we doing it and things like that. A couple of them even said they would like to try it so Marsha and I set them up. Both did it once and both said that once was enough. 

"Dorie was one of the ones who wanted to know all about it. She was always asking about what we did, how we did it and I could tell she was interested in trying, but just couldn't quite get up the nerve. One day during lunch break Dorie sat down with me and asked me why I was so down in the dumps that day and I told her. Marsha and I were set up to do a party that night and Marsha had gotten sick. I was looking at having to do twelve to fourteen guys by myself and I wasn't looking forward to it. Dorie told me that she would sub for Marsha. I asked her if she knew what she was letting herself in for and she said no idea, but that it was something that she had wanted to try since first hearing about it. 

"I asked her why she was willing to risk her marriage and she told me that you had been gone for three months and wouldn't be back for at least two more and that she was horny enough to fuck a hundred men. You would never know so she wasn't risking anything. She went with me that night and she liked it. She liked it enough to do it two more times and then she said she couldn't do it any more and as far as I know she hasn't."  

===

"I'm having trouble believing that she could go from faithful wife to pulling trains overnight. In my mind there has to have been a transition of sorts. A parking lot romance or two or maybe a short affair. I just can't see a faithful wife on Tuesday doing a gang bang on Wednesday." 

"I don't know what to tell you Frank. I didn't stop every night that the girls stopped so I don't know what went on when I wasn't there, but I never saw her doing anything on the nights I was there except dance with guys that asked her and other than that I wouldn't know." 

I hadn't really expected to get anything from Brenda. If she did know anything I doubted that she would tell me because she was Dorie's friend and she barely knew me. What I did expect was that she would tell Doris about our meeting and suggest that Doris hold nothing back if she was indeed to follow Brenda's suggestion and confess. 

I was of a mind to try and put things back together with Doris. One thing was clear in that overheard speaker phone conversation. Doris loved me and didn't want to lose me. Yes, she had cheated on me, but it was six years ago and she had quit as soon as she realized that what she was doing could somehow get back to me and cost her me and her marriage. 

I was pissed that she had cheated and extremely pissed at the way she had done it. Bachelor party gang bangs for Christ's sake! But again, it was six years ago and it hadn't hurt us any. In fact, I suppose you could even say that some good came out of it. Before I went to Alaska Doris would suck my cock, but would never let me cum in her mouth. I couldn't eat her pussy and anal sex was strictly forbidden. She wouldn't even do doggie. 

After I got back from Fairbanks that had gradually changed. Doris wanted to try other positions and decided that she liked cow girl and doggie. She started swallowing and told me she would like to see what it was like to have her beaver munched on. When I asked why the sudden change she told me about some articles she had read in Cosmopolitan and some other magazines like that about how to spice up your sex life and she decided to try them. Then she told me that after hearing some of the girls she worked with talk about anal and how great it was she wanted to try it at least once. All three then became a regular part of our love making. At the time I accepted what she said, but looking back at things it was easy to see that the real reason was that she had done those things during her gangbangs and had liked them. So I was already in a 'forgive' mood when I showed up at the house for my meeting with Doris, but I guess it was really more of a 'see if you can forgive' mood than anything else. There was still one other issue that was going to have to be addressed if we got by Doris' confession if indeed that is what our meeting was all about. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I rang the doorbell and waited. I rang it a second time and waited some more. I was getting ready to ring it a third time and then said, "Fuck it!" and turned and headed for my truck. I heard the door open behind me and Doris call out: 

"Where are you going Frank?" 

"When you wouldn't answer the door I figured that you changed your mind about talking so I'm leaving." 

"I didn't answer the door because this is your house. All you had to do was open the door and walk in." 

"This isn't my house Doris. Have you already forgotten that you tossed all my stuff out onto the lawn and locked me out?" 

"Let's not fight Frank. Please, just come on in." 

Once inside she asked me if I wanted to sit in the living room or the kitchen and I chose the kitchen. I sat down at the table and Doris went to the fridge and got two beers. She opened them and set one down in front of me. I took a pull on the bottle, set down on the table and then said: 

"Okay Doris; you called this meeting so have at it." 

She stared at her beer bottle for a few seconds and then she looked at me and said: 

"I need you to believe me when I tell you that I love you. I do Frank; I do love you and losing you is going to kill me. I have pretty much accepted that I've lost you and I have no one to blame but me. I did myself in the other night when I told you that I would take a lie detector test to prove to you that I didn't have sex with Mel Timmonds. I would have passed that test Frank. That is I would have passed it if the only question would have been "Have you ever had sex with Mel Timmonds." But the next day while I was looking for some one to give me the test it dawned on me that there would be more questions than just that one and that one of the questions would probably be "Have you ever cheated on your husband?" I couldn't get by that one Frank. I have cheated on you, but it was a long time ago. I put it behind me and in truth it didn't hurt our marriage at all. If anything it helped make it better because it showed me how much I stood to lose if you ever found out. I know that it probably sounds stupid, but cheating on you actually made me a better wife to you. It even sounds dumb to me when I say it, but it is the truth. I did become a better wife or at least I think I did." 

She looked at me as if she expected me to say something, but I just sat there, drank my beer and waited for her to get back to talking. When she realized I wasn't going to speak she said: 

"It happened six years ago when you were in Alaska on that temporary assignment. I was so used to us making love four and five times a week that going without sex was pretty much killing me and after about two months I started thinking about having an affair. I thought long and hard on it. I decided to do it since you were way to hell and gone up in Alaska and would never know. I dated a couple of times but when it came time to fish or cut bait I backed away from it. I know myself pretty well Frank and I knew that if I got into a relationship I would become emotionally involved and I didn't want that. I wasn't looking to replace you; I just wanted to get laid. I did do some heavy necking and a couple of times I did get a little carried away. I gave one guy a hand job while he sucked my tits and another guy got a blow job while he finger fucked me. I just could not bring myself to go all the way. 

"I was in a bad place. I wanted it. I needed it. I craved it, but I could bring myself to take the last step and do it. I could not trust myself not to become emotionally involved. Then a chance to get laid without any possibility of emotional involvement came up. Not only would there be no chance of emotional involvement, but it would allow me to live out a fantasy that I'd had for a while." 

She looked at me expectantly, probably waiting for me to say something about fantasies, but I just sat there so she went on. 

"You have met Brenda and while you would never suspect it of her she works evenings as a stripper and she does bachelor parties. One of the girls found out about it and we all stared asking her about it. The more I heard her say about it the more I wondered what it would be like. I started having fantasies about it. I sounded so damned exciting, but all they were Frank were fantasies. I fantasized that I was dancing naked in a room full of men who were all trying to get their hands on me. I fantasized pulling a train and being fucked by a room full of men. I never expected to ever do something like that, but I was thinking about it all the time. 

"Becky and Karen wanted to try it and they talked Brenda into setting it up for them. They both said it was mind blowing and that they loved doing it, but once was enough for them. Even as horny as I was I doubt that I'd have ever gotten up the nerve to ask Brenda to set up one for me, but one day she was in a downer of a mood and I asked her why and she told me that Marsha, another girl I work with, who worked parties with her was sick or something and couldn't make it to one of their scheduled parties. Brenda was upset because she was going to have to handle at least twelve guys all by herself and she wasn't looking forward to it. To this day I have no idea what prompted me to do it but I volunteered to take Marsha's place for the party. It was just like Becky and Karen had said. It was mind blowing and I loved it. I loved it so much that I did it two more times and I wanted to do even more, but I suddenly woke up to the fact that I wouldn't be able to hide doing things like that. If I kept on doing it you would have eventually have found out and I knew what you would do when it happened. 

"I couldn't take the chance. I couldn't lose you Frank; I just couldn't. You were my world. I have never loved anyone or anything as much as I love you. So I walked away from the parties even though I loved doing them. What I saw at those parties is also the reason I was so against your going. I saw how men reacted in that kind of environment. It has been years since then, but I still think about the three I did and wish there was some way I could have both." 

"Both?" 

"Be able to do the parties and still keep you. But here we are six years later and the damned parties have ended up costing me you and I have only myself to blame. If I hadn't done that garbage with Mel and then pulled that stupid move of trying to make you think I went out to get even with you I wouldn't have put myself in the position of having to take a lie detector test. A test that I couldn't possibly pass. I'm sorry Frank. I am so sorry for what I've done to us." 

I looked at her long and hard and then I said, "Take the test Doris. If you can show me that your three parties and the hand job and blow job you say you gave are the only times you have cheated I'll come back and we can talk some more." 

I got up and left the house. I believed her, but even though I believed her I felt the need to make her suffer. I was as horny when I was in Alaska as she was here at home, but I kept my dick in my pants and behaved myself because I had a loving and faithful wife at home waiting for me or so I believed at the time. Letting her sit alone in the house thinking that she had lost me would be at least a little payback. Some might have said, "Okay, she owes me so I'll just call up Brenda and Marsha and even the score" but I just wasn't made that way. Curse the rotten luck! 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day at four Stella buzzed me on the intercom. "You still ducking calls from your wife?" 

"No. Go ahead and put her through." 

The phone rang and I picked it up. "Yes?" 

"It's Doris Frank. I've found someone to give me the test. He wants to talk to you so you can tell him what you want to know so he can ask the right questions. His name is Josh Barnham and his number is 713-555-1863. If you call him by noon tomorrow he will be able to set up the test for 10 a.m. Thursday and have the results ready by mid to late afternoon." 

"All right Doris. I'll call him as soon as you hang up." 

"I love you Frank. I really do." 

"Sure you do Doris, sure you do" I said as I disconnected. 

I called Barnham, explained the situation and what my concerns were and what I needed to know and when I was done talking with him I called my cousin Lou who was a cop and asked him to find out what he could about Barnham. He called me back at six and told me that the department used Barnham a lot and that he had a pretty good reputation. I went to my room feeling that I was going to get a legitimate test. If Doris passed it I'd have another meeting with her. And if she didn't? Well, I was already moved out. 

The next two days went by quickly and at noon on Thursday I received a call from Doris telling me that she had taken the test and had signed a release so that Barnham could give me the results. She had to sign the release since she was paying for the test and not me. I didn't expect to hear from him until Friday since Doris had told me the results wouldn't be available until mid to late afternoon so I was surprised when Barnham called me at two-fifteen. 

"The results were conclusive. Other than the instances that she told you about she tested as truthful when it came to any other instances of unfaithfulness. I hope that this does help to ease your mind." 

"It does. Thank you for the call." 

I had no sooner walked out of the office when my cell went off. It was Doris. 

"You get the results?" 

"Yes." 

"You coming home?" 

"I'll stop by tomorrow and we'll talk." 

"Tomorrow? Why can't you come tonight?" 

"I still have some things I need to think through. Tomorrow at seven?" 

"No way I can talk you into tonight?" 

"No way. I'll see you tomorrow" and I hung up. I spent the night in my room thinking on what I was going to say to Doris. She wasn't out of the woods yet. True, she had passed the lie detector test, but I had one other problem with her that would have to be worked out before I got back with her. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day I was walking up the front seeps at seven and I wasn't to the top step when Doris opened the door. "Kitchen?" she asked and I nodded a yes and we headed that way. She got two beers out of the icebox and we sat down at the table. I took a drink of the Bud and then said: 

"You passed the lie detector test, but the fact still remains that you did cheat on me while I was in Alaska. I listened to you give your reasons, but I have to tell you that those reasons cut no ice with me. I was suffering from the same lack of sex that you were, but I kept my dick in my pants just like I promised I would when I took my wedding vows. I don't know what pisses me off the most, the fact that you cheated or the way you cheated. I have spent a lot of time thinking about it and I have decided that I can get by it since you never did again and the last six years for the most part – the most part Doris – have been good years and until recently I've had no reason to doubt your love for me and I will admit that I've gotten some benefit out of your cheating gangbangs. I've gotten better blow jobs and I've gotten to do anal and I know that they are because you did them during your gang bangs and either found that you liked them or at least decided that you could put up with them. 

"Did you catch that "For the most part" Doris? There have been parts of those years that have sucked and what I have to decide now is whether or not I want to put myself back in a position where those things that sucked can happen again. We can go back to my Alaskan trip. I stayed true and you didn't. I was hurting from the lack of sex as much as you were, but I suffered and kept to my vows. The thread between then and now Doris is that I suffer when there is a lack of sex. I man up and tough it out. There have been several times over the past few years, most recently the bullshit over Jim's bachelor party, where you have used sex as a weapon against me. Whenever you have done that I have suffered in silence when every atom in my body was screaming out "You don't have to take this shit dummy; go out, find a woman and get laid" but I never have because I believe in the vows I took. 

"I am sick and tired of you using sex to punish me or to try and get me to do what you want. I admit that your body is yours and you get to be the one who determines what to do with it. I know that there are going to be times I'm going to want to make love and that you aren't going to feel like it. I realize that there will be times you won't be feeling well or will have a headache and won't feel like making love. I can accept that, but I am done with you using your cunt as a weapon against me. 

"So that's where we are now. You know my position and you need to give some thought to how you want to proceed." 

'I'll never do it again Frank. I swear to God I'll never do it again." 

"No Doris, that won't work. I don't want you saying that just after I've hit you with it. I want you to take some time and really think about it. Make sure that you can make the commitment and stick with it because if we do get back together and you pull that shit on me again I'll be gone and they will not be any more talking. So think long and hard on it Doris. I'll give you a call in a couple of days and we will talk again." 

"I don't need time to think on it Frank." 

"Maybe you don't think you do, but I think you do and I'm the one who is going to have to take the gamble on whether or not to get back with you. I pay for my motel room by the week and I'm paid up until Sunday. I'll call you sometime Sunday" and I got up and left. 

I was being an asshole and I knew it. I didn't need to stall her until Sunday, but I needed the satisfaction of seeing her suffer a little given all the shit she had put me through. I left the house and headed for the Hitching Post. I drank beer and shot some pool until I felt it was time to call it a night. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Saturday I ran some errands, hit a laundromat and washed my dirty clothes. That evening found me back at the Hitching Post. I was drinking beer and shooting pool when a voice behind me said: 

"Why are you over here playing this silly game when you could be dancing with me?" 

I turned and found Hanna standing there. 

"Good question" I said and handed my pool cue to Sam and said, "You win Sam" and then I led Hanna out onto the dance floor. 

"I was surprised when you never called after taking me home the other night." 

"Why? I told you my situation." 

"Yeah, but I thought that it was just a line you fed girls to get them to let down their guard." 

"Sorry, but it was the truth." 

"I've been watching since you got here and I haven't seen a woman. Still haven't worked it out?" 

"Getting close. Maybe tomorrow." 

"Okay then; I've got you until tomorrow." 

"Till tomorrow?" 

"At least until this place closes or either of us decides to leave." 

The song ended and I walked her back to her table and joined her. We danced a couple more dances and we had just sat down after a waltz when she said: 

"Do you know those two women over there? They haven't taken their eyes off of us since they got here." 

I looked toward where she was looking and saw Brenda and Marsha sitting at a table. When I looked they both waved and I waved back. 

"Just two more members of my fan club. With you that makes a total of three. Now that I've seen them you are going to have to share me with them." 

"Why?" 

"Because they work with my wife and if we don't join them they will assume that I'm dating you and I wouldn't want them telling that to Doris." 

I got up ands walked over to Brenda and Marsha and asked them if they would like to join me and Hanna at our table. 

"Won't that cramp your style" Marsha asked. 

"No style to cramp. Just a girl I know who asked me to dance." 

"You here alone" Brenda asked. 

I nodded a yes and then said, "I came in to shoot some pool and drink some beer and Hanna decided that she wanted to rescue me." 

"I take it you haven't worked things out with Doris yet" Brenda asked. 

"We've talked and we might be making some progress. I'll know in a day or two." 

Brenda raised her eyebrows and I said, "She took your advice. I know all about it now and yes, I can get by it, but we still have an issue that needs to be worked out." 

"What advice" Marsha asked Brenda. "I'll tell you later" Brenda said. 

"So how about it? You going to join us?" 

Brenda looked at Marsha and Marsha shrugged. Brenda said, "I guess we will have to if only to keep you out of the girls clutches and protect Doris' interests." 

"Bullshit" Marsha said. "I'm doing it to make sure that she doesn't have a clear field if Frank doesn't work things out with Doris. As far as I'm concerned we have first dibs on Frank." 

The three of us went over and joined Hanna and I made the introductions. I spent the rest of the evening dancing with the three of them. When I danced with Brenda she naturally wanted to know what was going to happen between me and Doris.  

===

"The odds are that Dorie and I will be back together when you see her at work on Monday. It isn't a hundred percent certainty, but it is close. I may be wrong. I gave her an ultimatum and if she accepts it we will be back together. If she doesn't, we won't." 

"You do know that there will be several upset women if you and Doris do get back together don't you?" 

"That doesn't seem likely." 

"Oh but it is. Marsha likes Doris, but she is hoping that the two of you don't get back together so that she might have a chance at you. The young lady you just introduced us to is obviously smitten with you and then of course there is me. Doris is a good friend and I'd never try and steal you from her, but if the two of you were to split up I'd be after you in a heart beat." 

"Well just between you and me, if Doris and I do break up and Marsha, Hanna and you are still available you will be the winner." 

She smiled, kissed me and we went back to the table when the song ended. Shortly after that I called it a night and went back to the motel. 

+++++++++++++++ 

I slept late the next morning and when I got up I went up the street to the IHOP for breakfast. I went back to the hotel room and debated packing, but then decided not to take anything for granted. 

At noon I called Doris. 

"Hello?" 

"It's me." 

"When are you coming home?" 

"What did you decide?" 

"Damn it to hell Frank; you damn well know what I decided. It will never happen again. I swear it. Please come home." 

"Look for me around five. I've got some packing to do." 

"I'll have dinner ready." 

As I packed I wondered if she could do it. Women are hard-wired to use sex to get what they want, but I had meant what I'd said. I guess only time would tell.  

===

It is said that "The husband is always the last to know" and it may or may not have been true in my case, but the one thing that was true was that I did know. 

I didn't discover it by accident or get clued in by some friend of mine or an enemy of my wife's. No, I got it from the horse's mouth so to speak. It was at breakfast after a night of hot sex and I was on my second cup of coffee when my wife Iris said: 

"My boss took me to lunch yesterday. We ended up in a hotel room and spent most of the afternoon there. I liked it and we will probably do more of it." 

It set me back and I was silent for a few seconds and then I asked, "Why last night? You get a kick out of giving me sloppy seconds?" 

"I didn't give you sloppy seconds. I cleaned myself up pretty good when we were done." 

"Still, you spread your legs for me only hours after he pulled his cock out of you. To me that means seconds, sloppy or not." 

"I guess I was just feeling a little guilty and I figured that if I did you right after doing him....Oh shit! I don't know what I was thinking. I just felt the need to make love to you. I guess I wanted to see if it changed anything and it didn't. I still like making love with you." 

"Make love? You just told me that you fucked your boss and that you will be doing it again. Where's the love in that?" 

"It was a figure of speech Frank. Anyway, I'm telling you to give you time to figure out what you want to do in case you don't want me around you any more." 

"Why would I want you around if you can so casually pull shit like this on me? I'm going to have to think about what I want to do and you need to move into one of the kid's bedrooms." 

"There is no need for that Frank. I just told you that I like making love with you." 

"Maybe so. But I don't have any idea of what other whores your boss is fucking and I want to make damned sure that you don't give me anything that he might have given you. I just hope that it isn't too late. You might have given me a gift from him last night." 

Her face blanched when I said "Other whores" with the clear implication that she was one and then she said: 

"He wouldn't do anything that would give him a disease. He has to be careful because of his wife." 

I shook my head in disgust and got from the table to get ready to go to work. When I came out of the shower Iris was sitting on the bed. 

"When I told you that I was telling you so you could figure out if you wanted me around I was hoping that you would say that we needed to talk about it." 

"What's to talk about? You cheated on me and then casually threw it in my face. If you could be that casual about it I have to ask myself if this was the first time for you or just another in a long line. How do I know that you were really working all those nights you called me and said you had to work late? You said that you spent most of the afternoon in a hotel room with Ted so how do I know you don't spend hotel room afternoons a couple of times a week? How do I know that Ted is the only one? 

"No Iris; we have nothing to talk about. Well that isn't totally true. We will have to decide how to let Dave and Marci know. And then of course there is your family and mine. We will need to let all of them know and more than likely we will have to tell them why since I have no intention of everyone thinking I'm the bad guy in this. Everyone is going to have to know that I'm not the one who wrecked our marriage." 

"It doesn't have to be that way Frank. I love you and other than yesterday with Ted I've never been unfaithful. Yesterday just happened. It was a spur of the moment thing. I did it just to do it. I wanted to be something other than just the mother and housewife I've been for the last twenty-four years. I just wanted to do something wild and wicked for once in my life. I did it and I liked it. It had nothing to do with any feelings for Ted. He was just in the right place at the right time. It was exciting and one hell of a turn on, but it did not diminish my feelings for you one iota." 

"Maybe not Iris, but it damned sure diminished my feelings for you. And I'm not forgetting the part where you said you would probably do it again. I have no idea what I'm going to do until after I've talked to an attorney, but you can consider our marriage over. No amount of talking will ever get me to the point where I could ever trust you again." 

I finished putting the Windsor knot in my tie and left the room and went to work. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

My mind wasn't on work and the company did not get it's moneys worth out of me that day. I did let my fingers walk through the Yellow Pages looking for an attorney close to the office and I found one and gave him a call. The soonest he could see me was the next afternoon and I made an appointment. As I made a note in my day planner I noticed the date. It was one week before what would have been our twenty-fourth anniversary. Well, I thought, I won't have to waste money on a card and a gift this year. 

After work I headed for home because, quite frankly, I had nowhere else to go. A trip to a bar to drown my sorrows in alcohol didn't appeal to me and I wasn't about to go find a friend whose shoulder I could cry on. 

Iris usually got home before I did and had dinner ready when I got home and that night was no different. She had the table set and she even had a bottle of wine open. I didn't know what she was hoping for, but whatever it was she wasn't likely to get it. I suppose given the way I was feeling I should have just gone into the den and ignored Iris and the dinner she had prepared, but I had to eat and it was there. 

I poured myself a glass of wine and sat down at the table. Dinner was meatloaf, gravy, mashed potatoes and salad. I ate in silence. I could see that Iris was trying to work herself up to say something and I hoped that she wouldn't get to that point before I finished my meal. It would be more satisfying for me to be able to stand up and walk out of the room on a full stomach when she started to talk. 

It wasn't to be. I had just put a forkful of salad in my mouth when Iris said: 

"Would it make a difference if I were to tell you that it will never happen again?" 

I was not one for talking with my mouthful so I said nothing as I chewed on the salad. She fidgeted and then said: 

"It was a mistake Rob; a huge mistake that I deeply regret. One bad thing in twenty-four years of marriage Rob. Can't you bring yourself to forgive me for doing one bad thing in all our marriage? Does what we have shared for twenty- four years have to be lost – thrown away – just because I made one stupid mistake?" 

I'd finished chewing my salad by then and had swallowed it so I said: 

"There was more than one mistake Iris. The first was when you let another man screw you and I don't even know that Ted was the first one. Nor do I know that fucking Ted yesterday was the first time you fucked him." 

I put emphasis on the word 'fuck' every time I used it and every time I used it Iris flinched. 

"The second mistake was in telling me. If you had kept your mouth shut we wouldn't be sitting here in these strained circumstances. Your third mistake and it was a biggie, was telling me that you liked it and would probably do more of it. So the answer to your question is yes; what we have shared over the last twenty-four years has to be thrown away because of what you did. You have completely lost my trust Iris and a marriage can not exist without trust. At least not a marriage that I'm in." 

She got up from the table and was crying when she left the room. I took a sip of my wine and finished me dinner. When I was done I cleaned up the kitchen and then went into my den to play on the computer for a while. 

When I went upstairs to go to bed I saw that Iris had moved her things into Marci's old room. She probably chose Marci's room because Marci wouldn't be using it any time in the near future. Marci had married and had moved out to California and only used her room when she came back to visit. Dave still did use his room when he came home on leave so he could be back at any time. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I didn't see Iris in the morning and I stopped at a Village Inn for breakfast. When I got to work I waited until nine which was when the day started at Wallish and Tilden and then I gave them a call. When the receptionist answered I asked for Ted Haarbauer and when he came on the line and said hello I said: 

"This is Rob Meyers Ted. Iris told me about your afternoon romp at the hotel and I thought I'd call and let you know that I'm kicking her out and she is all yours. Also, while on the subject, you should know that I'm pissed and I am going to be looking for you. Make sure that your health insurance is paid up because you are going to need it." 

I hung up on him without giving him a chance to say a word. I would go looking for him in time, but I was in no hurry. Let him sweat it. Let him spend time looking over his shoulder and wondering if the shadows he saw had me hiding in them just waiting to jump him. 

That afternoon at three I got the bad news. Our state was a no fault state so everything would be split evenly. Iris and I made approximately the same money so there wasn't likely to be any alimony. The kids were grown and out on their own so child support wouldn't enter into it. There might be some issues on our respective retirement plans and we each had 401(k)s through work, but the attorney thought they would cancel each other out. 

All in all it would be a pretty straight forward divorce as far as divorces went. Then the attorney brought up the fact that we could probably go after Haarbauer in an alienation of affections suit and we might even be able to go after Wallish and Tilden if they had a company policy and procedures manual that prohibited sexual misconduct between employees. I nixed that. To me it didn't seem right to hold W&T responsible for what Ted and Iris did. Besides, if we did that they would probably both lose their jobs and we wouldn't be able to get anything out of Haarbauer and I'd end up paying Iris alimony. I told him to go ahead and prepare the divorce paperwork and the paperwork for the suit on Haarbauer and then have them both served. 

It was after four when I left the attorney's office so I decided that there was no sense in going back to work. On the ride home I pondered the asset split. We had quite a bit of equity in the house and in fact it would be paid off in three more years. Did I want to buy out Iris and keep the house? I thought not. What would a single man do with a large four bedroom house? Not only that but every thing in the house would be a constant reminder of what life had been like in that house before Iris spread her legs for Haarbauer. So the options were Iris buying me out or putting the house up for sale. 

When I got home Iris had dinner ready so I sat and ate. I could see that she had something she wanted to say, but couldn't bring herself to say it. I finished eating and was getting up from the table when Iris said: 

"Ted told me that you called him and threatened him today." 

"Not true. I didn't threaten him; I made him a promise." 

"You will just get yourself in trouble Rob. You could end up in jail." 

"Why would you care? I'd be out of the way and you would be able to spend more hotel afternoons with lover boy. Providing of course that I leave him with anything to play with." 

"Please don't do it Rob. Please? For me?" 

I laughed and said, "For you? I'll tell you what I did for you. I saw an attorney today and told him to start the divorce paperwork rolling. You can tell your lover that he isn't going to be able to hide behind your skirts." 

"I wasn't thinking of him. I don't want to see you go to jail because I was stupid." 

"I wouldn't mind. I could sit inside and smile thinking about how you were feeling knowing that you were responsible for my being there. Imagine how good it would feel for me to be able to tell Dave and Marci that you were the reason their dad was locked up in jail." 

"Don't even talk like that Rob." 

"Why not? I've already told you that I'm going to make damned sure that everyone knows that I'm not the reason that this marriage went into the trash can. Get yourself ready for it Iris. You are going to have a lot of people asking you why you threw your marriage away. Another thing for you to think about is what you want to do about the house. I don't want it so if you do you are going to have to buy me out. Otherwise it will have to be put up for sale." 

"Sell the house? Oh God Rob, no. We can't do that." 

"Then you need to figure out how to go about buying me out." 

I left her sitting in the kitchen and went into the den to play on the computer. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning I was up and gone before Iris got up. At work I told my Barney (my boss) what was going on in my life and that I might have to take some time off here and there for attorney meetings, court appearances and the like. He wished me luck and told me to take whatever time I needed. 

Iris wasn't home when I got there so I micro-waved some leftovers and then watched some TV for a while. The phone rang and I answered it and it was my daughter Marci. 

"Mom called me to tell me that you were leaving her." 

"She tell you why?" 

"She just said that it was all her fault. What happened?" 

"Lets just leave it at it was all her fault. I had intended to call both you and Dave and let you know what happened because I didn't want people thinking that I was the bad guy in this, but if she has already admitted that it was her fault that's good enough." 

"Any chance that the two of you can work through it?" 

"No chance at all." 

"Why dad? You two were so much in love with each other." 

"The operative word there kiddo is 'were'. How are things going with you?" 

"Good. I'd come home to see if I could help, but I'm involved in a critical project at work and I can't get away." 

"That's okay honey; there isn't anything you can do anyway." 

"You don't need to call Dave. Mom called him too and then he called me to see what I knew about things. You take care daddy. I love you." 

"I love you too sweetie. I'll be talking to you." 

Three minutes later Dave called and the conversation went pretty much the same as my conversation with Marci had gone. I'd just hung up the phone when Iris came in. 

"Late evening with Haarbauer" I asked sarcastically. 

"Fuck you Rob. For your information I've spent the time since getting off work visiting your parents and mine. I told them about the coming divorce and I told them that it was all my fault. I didn't give them specifics. I just told them that it wasn't because of anything you did. Now if you don't mind I'm going to go up to my room and lose it." 

I saw tears running down her cheeks as she left the room and headed for the stairs. A week ago the sight would have had me rushing to her to take her in my arms and to try and comfort her. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning at work Barney called me into his office. 

"Is this divorce thing you are going through a definite thing? Is there any chance that it won't happen? You know, the two of you working it out and stuff like that?" 

"No chance of its not happening. Why?" 

"Kids all grown and out of the house? Nothing really tying you here?" 

"Other than my parents and sister living here not really. Why?" 

"I've just been told that O'Brian is retiring. I need some one to replace him in the Santa Monica office. How would you feel about living in California? The job is yours if you are okay with the move." 

"You're kidding. There are guys here senior to me who would kill for the job." 

"Maybe, but just being senior doesn't mean that they can do the job. I've looked at everyone closely and you are my pick." 

"I'll take it. When do I have to be there?" 

"O'Brian gave a month's notice effective yesterday. I would like you out there for his last week so he can fill you in on everything." 

"I'll start making arrangements immediately." 

The first thing I did when I got back to my office was call the attorney and ask how the move would affect the divorce. 

"Depends on whether or not she fights it. If she fights it you could be ding a lot of flying back and forth for meetings, hearings and the like. Shouldn't any problem at all if she doesn't fight it." 

"How can she fight it? I thought that was the whole purpose behind no fault divorces – to eliminate all the crap." 

"Normally true, but that's if both parties are okay with the divorce. If she doesn't want the divorce she could say that the marriage could be saved with counseling and the court could so order. She can't stop the divorce, but she can delay it and make it more expensive and sometimes that's enough to make the party suing drop things." 

"Well I'm not stopping it. When are you going to serve both her and Haarbauer?" 

"The papers are ready. All I need is your go ahead." 

"Do it. This afternoon if possible." 

"Consider it done." 

He called me at three that afternoon and told me that the papers had been served at two thirty-five. Iris was sitting in the living room when I got home from work and it was clear to me that she had been crying. She looked up at me when I came into the room and said: 

"You did it. You really did it. I can't believe that you would throw away twenty-four good years over one mistake." 

"You still don't get it do you? It wasn't the fact that you fucked Haarbauer. It was the way you threw it in my face and looked me right in the eye and said that you liked it and you were probably going to do it again. Get it straight in your head Iris; I didn't throw away twenty-four good years – you did! You need to figure out what you want to do as far as the house is concerned because two weeks from now I'm going to be out of here." 

I left the room, went into the kitchen and got some leftovers out of the fridge. After eating I went into the den and called Marcie out in California. After exchanging greetings I said: 

"I don't know if it is good news or not, but I'm going to be coming out there to live. Should be in about two weeks." 

"You and mom?" 

"Just me. I served her with divorce papers today. I need you to do me a favor." 

"Anything dad; you know that." 

"Check out apartments and condos within a reasonable distance of Santa Monica and find me a hotel or motel in the same area where I can stay when I first get out there." 

"Not on your life pops. You will stay with me. No way I'm letting you stay in a motel." 

"Won't that inconvenience you and Alan?" 

"Not a bit. Don't worry about Alan." 

"Okay then; if you are sure." 

"I am pops. I'm looking forward to seeing you." 

"Me to kiddo; I'll call you as soon as things are more definite." 

In the morning Iris was up and sitting at the kitchen table when I came downstairs. "Good morning" she said and I said nothing as I poured myself a cup of coffee. 

"I've decided that I don't want the house if I don't have you to share it with me." 

"I'll call a realtor this morning and get the ball rolling." 

"It doesn't have to be this way Rob." 

"I'm sorry Iris, but yes it does." 

I poured my coffee into a travel mug and headed off for work. I called a real estate agent from work and arranged to meet him at the house at one and by three the process was in work. 

I had stopped at a U-Haul place on the way home and purchased a bunch of boxes to start packing my stuff in. When I got home Iris wasn't there, but there was a note on the kitchen table saying that she would be staying at her sisters for the next couple of days. 

I spent the evening packing and moving boxes out into the garage. By bedtime all that was left to pack was the stuff in the den and the clothes that I would need for the next two weeks.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day my attorney called me and told me that he had heard from Haarbauer. 

"He says we can go pound sand in our ass because we have no proof. All we have is what your wife told you and he said he will deny it. I hate to admit it, but he is right." 

"Don't stop the suit. I'll see if we can get something that we can use." 

"How can you do that?" 

"I don't know. Let me think on it." 

I spent the next two days doing what I needed to do to get ready for the move. Iris was still at her sister's so when I got home from work I called her sister and asked to speak to Iris. When she came on the line I told her we needed to talk and I asked her to come home so we could sit down at the kitchen table and do it. She said she would come over, but she wouldn't stay. 

She arrived at seven and I had coffee made. We sat down and I told her about my move to the coast. I gave her the real estate agent's card and told her that she was going to have to handle the sale and I would be back for the closing when the house was sold. I told her I would be staying with Marci until I could find a place of my own and that she could reach me there. Then I asked her the sixty-four thousand dollar question. 

"Why Iris? Why did you cheat on me and with Ted Haarbauer of all people?" 

"I told you Rob; it just happened. It was spur of the moment." 

"I don't understand Iris. How could it just happen and be spur of the moment." 

"I don't want to talk about it Rob. It was a stupid thing to do and it cost me you." 

"You might not want to talk about it Iris, but I really do need to know. Was I that bad of a husband that you could do that to me? Was my performance in the bedroom so bad that you had to go somewhere else to get taken care of?" 

"It wasn't any of that Rob. I can't really explain my mindset when it happened. All it was supposed to be was Ted taking me to lunch. When he hit on me it came as a complete surprise since he had never indicated he thought of me in a sexual way. Maybe it was the way he came onto me. He asked me if I had ever cheated on you and I said no and I asked him why he had asked that question. He told me that he had always had the hots for me and since we were eating in a hotel restaurant and there were rooms upstairs he thought that he would take a shot. If I'd cheated before maybe I would again with him. I think I surprised him when I told him to pay the bill and get us a room. 

"I know it makes no sense to you, but like I told you before I wanted to be something other that a wife and mother for once. I just wanted to do something exciting and wicked for once in my life and Ted coming on to me gave me the chance." 

"But why with Haarbauer?" 

"It just happened to be the right place at the right time and he was the one who asked." 

"Why did you tell me that you liked it and were going to do it again? Was Haarbauer that much of a better lover." 

"No, Ted wasn't any better. It was the wicked feeling that I got from having sex with another man. It was exciting and a huge turn on. I had one of the biggest orgasms of my life and it wasn't from the sexual act. It was from the wicked feeling that I got from cheating. I said I'd probably do it again because I wanted more of those fantastic orgasms. Telling you about Ted and me was another stupid move on my part. Talk about being mixed up. On the one hand it was the cheating that made me go off so hard, but it was the guilt from the cheating that made me confess. 

"I thought when I confessed we would have the conversation we are having now and I could convince you that my having sex outside the marriage wouldn't hurt us. It would only be sex with Ted and you and I would still have the love that we'd shared for twenty-four years. I was sure that you would realize how much I loved you and that you would let me get the wicked and wild thing out of my system. And it would have you know. Ted wasn't all that great in bed. It was the cheating that made it so good and I'd have gotten over it after a couple of times. 

"I know now that I should have kept my mouth shut and let things with Ted die a natural death. If I'd have kept my mouth shut I'd still have you because you would never have known. Does this talk indicate that you might change your mind?" 

"Not a chance Iris. I've already told you why. All this talk did was ease my mind. Now I know that it was nothing that I did or didn't do that drove you to it and knowing that will help me sleep better." 

Iris left and I got up and shut off the tape recorder that I had hidden on the kitchen counter. 

The next day, after making a couple of copies of the recording I stopped by the attorney's office and gave him a copy. I earmarked a copy for Haarbauer's wife, but I'd hold off on giving it to her until after the suit with Haarbauer was settled. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next week was hectic as I brought my replacement up to date and got everything ready for the move. The house had gone on the market and we had already had two couples look at it. Hopefully that was a good sign as far as getting it sold went. On my last Friday the people in the office held a going away party for me at the lounge just down the street from the office and the next afternoon I was in a U-Haul truck and on my way to California. 

An hour out I called Marci and got directions to her place. She must have been watching out the window for me since she was out the door and running to me as I pulled up and parked. I got a big hug and then she helped me unload the car off the trailer I had towed. Next was a drive to a storage facility where I put the stuff from the truck into a rented unit. From there it was to a local U- Haul dealer to turn in the truck and trailer and then we went back to Marci's place. 

"Your first night here we are going out to dinner" Marci said, "And then I'll show you around." 

"What time will Alan get here?" 

"Allen won't be getting here. I kicked his ass out when I caught him doing the woman who lived next door." 

"No chance of the two of you putting it back together?" 

"About as much of a chance as you and mom putting it back together." 

I gave her a strange look and she said, "No one told me pops. I know my daddy and the kind of man he is. There is only one thing that would make him walk away and mom did call me and tell me that the two of you breaking up was all her fault. Besides, the woman next door had a husband and when he got through with Alan there wasn't much left." 

"Why didn't you let us know?" 

"Embarrassed or maybe ashamed. You two had over twenty years and I couldn't even make it to three." 

We went out and had an enjoyable dinner and then Marci drove me around to familiarize me with the area. We ended up at a place called The Blue Grotto. It was a fairly nice place and had a really good live band. Marci was apparently well known in the place and we no sooner sat down than several guys and gals stopped by to say hello. I was introduced to several of the ladies and Marci made a point of telling several of the girls that I was available. 

"Why did you do that" I asked. 

"If you are going to hang with me pops you can't be a wallflower. I'll spend a lot of time on the dance floor with some of the guys in here and it won't be right to leave you sitting at the table alone. Don't worry; you won't have to figure out what to do. The girls here are pretty forward and they will come after you." 

"I don't know sweetie. This really isn't my kind of scene." 

"Maybe it wasn't, but this place is just what you need right now. It will put a little life back in you." 

As if on cue a rather good looking blond came up to the table and said: 

"Can I steal your dad for a dance?" 

Marcie laughed and said to me, "See what I mean?" 

Before the evening was over I'd danced with five different women and two of them had given me their phone numbers and had asked me to give them a call. I have to admit that it was one hell of an ego boost after what Iris had done to me. I know that she told me that I wasn't lacking, but in the back of my mind there was a little doubt. After all she did go to another man. 

On the drive home to Marci's place I asked her if she'd found any suitable apartments for me and she said that she had found several, but I wasn't going to need them because I was going to be staying with her. 

"I don't think that's going to work sweetie." 

"Why not?" 

"I saw the way you danced with some of those guys tonight and I wouldn't want to put a crimp in your love life." 

"Don't be silly daddy. Those guys have their own places." 

"Yes sweetie, but what if I decide that I want to spread some pollen?" 

"We are adult's pops and you have your own room. We will manage." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next week was a busy one as I settled into my new job and got to know the people that would be working for me. Barney must have said something to Pat O'Brian and Pat had spread the word. There were three single women in the office and I could see that two of them were interested, but even though both of them were foxes they were out of bounds as far as I was concerned. No way was I going to open myself to a work place romance to say nothing about possible sexual harassment charges. 

I did go back to the grotto with Marci on Friday night and I do have to admit that I had a great time. Anna, one of the girls who had given me her number joined us at our table and asked me why I hadn't called her. I told her I was still moving in and getting used to my new job and the area and: 

"I almost didn't let Marci talk me into coming in here tonight." 

"Well you are here and so we will pretend that you called me and we agreed to meet here." 

Marci laughed and said, "You are on your own pops. If I were you I'd just surrender and go along with it." 

I took her advice and had a very enjoyable evening with Anna. When last call came Marci handed me her car keys and said: 

"Don't wait up. Tomorrow is Saturday and I don't have anything to do so I may not see you until around noon." 

As Marci walked away with one of the guys she had been dancing with Anna said: 

"It sounded to me like she was telling you that you wouldn't be interrupted if you catch my drift." 

I caught her drift alright and it was causing a small war in my head. 

"You can't; you are still a married man" was fighting it out with "You are separated and going through a divorce so you are as good as single" and on the sidelines, jumping up and down and screaming for attention was "You haven't been laid since finding out about Iris." 

I don't know why I was so hesitant. My own daughter was encouraging me to do it and there was also the fact that it could be considered that Iris by breaking her marriage vows had released me from my mine. In the end "You haven't been laid..." tipped the scale in Anna's favor. 

Was I ever glad that it did! 

I hadn't been fucked since the day I met Iris – we made love – but Anna tried to fuck my brains out and she damned near succeeded. She blew me and I ate her. We did sixty-nine and we screwed three times and the last time she took me in her butt. She tried to get me up for a fourth time, but wasn't able. We fell asleep cuddled up against each other. 

In the morning we had a sweaty good morning fuck followed by showering together which ended up with me buried in her butt again as she leaned against the shower wall. Over pancakes and bacon at the IHOP Anna casually let me know that she wasn't marriage material. 

"I don't have the temperament to live with anyone else. I've tried it and it doesn't work out. On the other hand I can be a great Friend with Benefits." 

"If last night was any indication I would have to say that the benefits are worth it. May I apply?" 

"Actually, you had your interview for the position last night and you got the job." 

I took her home and went back to Marci's place. When I walked in she was there and she smiled at me and with her eyes raised in question she mad the 'okay' sign with her thumb and forefinger and I smiled back and said "Very." 

Over the next two months I saw Anna two or three times a week and each and every time she tried her best to reduce me to rubble, but somehow I managed to stay with her. And then one Sunday morning she told me that the night had been our last one. She had taken a promotion and it was going to have her moving to Atlanta. It was a huge disappointment for me. I had gotten used to our relationship and I had hoped that it would go on for a long, long time. Marci told me that even though I would miss Anna there were replacements waiting in the wings. 

"Anna has been telling all the girls how great you are and if I had the money I would bet it all on your having a new honey before the week is out." 

She was right. The next Friday we had no sooner sat down at a table at the Grotto when women were coming up to ask me to dance. One of them, a hot little brunette named Mellissa – Mel to her friends – asked me four times. The last time was the last dance of the evening. The song was "Nights in White Satin" and as we slowly moved around the floor she pressed herself into my erection, looked me in the eye and said: 

"I want to be bad tonight. Can I be bad with you?" 

Marci had left an hour earlier and had told me not to expect her before noon so I told Mel: 

"You can be as bad with me as you want." 

Mel was a new experience for me. She was a nasty little bitch. She liked to have her nipples pinched and she even asked me to bite her clit when I was eating her pussy. She encouraged me to call her a cunt, a bitch, a cock sucking whore and other things. "Fuck me! Use me like the slut I am" she cried as I fucked her. She wanted me to hurt her and I of course said "No way!" 

"Please? I love it. Take my ass and don't go slow and easy. Drive it in and fuck me hard. Please lover?" 

I let her talk me into it and when I did it I got some idea of what rodeo cowboys went through when they were trying to hang on for a ten second ride on a bull or a bucking bronco. She went wild as I pounded her ass and I had to keep a firm grip on her hips to keep from losing her. 

Just how nasty was Mel? When I'd shot my wad in her ass and pulled out she spun around and took my dick in her mouth and she wouldn't let go until she had me up again. 

"I want it in my ass again" she said and I obliged her. The second ride wasn't as wild as the first, but it was still memorable. When it was over she had me set the clock for seven. 

"I have to be home before nine so I can take care of my mom." 

When I asked she told me that she still lived at home with her parents and her mother was an invalid and needed a lot of care. 

"Next Friday night? Please?" 

"Absolutely." 

Mel was my friend with benefits for the next two months. I could only see her on Thursdays and Fridays because she worked afternoons and Thursday and Friday were her days off. We had to play at Marci's because of Mel's mother. 

"If I brought you home with me she wouldn't understand lover." 

As wild as Mel was twice a week was more than enough. Playing with Mel came to an abrupt stop one Monday night near the end of our second month. I got off work and headed for my car and when I got there I found a man leaning against it. He straightened up as I walked up and said: 

"About time you got here." 

"Do I know you?" 

"No, and you are going to be sorry that you ever met me." 

"What's this all about?" 

"I aim to tear you a new asshole." 

I looked him over and then said, "It might not be all that easy for you. Care to tell me why you want to try?" 

"Because you have been fucking my wife, that's why." 

"Bullshit! I'm not screwing anybody's wife." 

"You deny you are fucking Mellie?" 

"Mel? Mel isn't married." 

"The fuck she ain't! She's been married to me for ten years." 

"If you are telling the truth and she is married I sure didn't know it. She isn't wearing rings and nobody at the Grotto ever told me that she was spoken for, but I'll tell you this. You kick her out and I'll take her in." 

"Why the hell would you do a stupid thing like that? If she cheats on me she'll cheat on you." 

"Have you asked her why?" 

"She doesn't know that I know." 

"You need to find out why. All I know is that if I take her I damned sure won't give her any reason to cheat. But I will say this. Now that I know that she is married I'll keep my hands off of her until the two of you have it out. But I do have a question for you. How can she go out every Friday and Saturday and stay gone all night without you knowing?" 

"I drive a truck and I'm gone from Thursday to Sunday." 

He stared at me as I prepared for his charge, but he surprised me and turned and walked away. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I spent the next week thinking about who I'd get to replace Mel. I stopped in at the Grotto on Friday and about half an hour after I got there Mel came in, saw me, and came over to join me. She sat down and said: 

"I understand that you've met Royce." 

"If Royce is your husband then yes, we have met." 

"Is that going to keep us from having fun?" 

"That depends on what happens." 

"In what way?" 

"I told him that I would stay away from you unless he got rid of you. Has he kicked you out yet?" 

"No and he won't because he loves me." 

"Then we can't play." 

"Why not?" 

"Because you are married and if I had known that up front I never would have started with you. I would never have knowingly done to another man what my wife and her lover did to me." 

"I don't see it that way. I'm only doing with you what Royce refuses to do with me. I love the man, but I need more than twice a week and only in the missionary position. Maybe if I had been a virgin when I married Royce it would be different, but I love anal and oral. I like doggie and cowgirl. Royce makes love to me, but I need to be fucked every once in a while and he won't do it so I look for guys who will. You and I have a great thing going lover. Let's not stop." 

"Sorry Mel, but unless Royce tells me that he has kicked you out we are history." 

She stared at me for a moment or two and then she got up and moved to another table and within five minutes she had a guy sitting with her. I danced with several other ladies who were there, but made no move to take up with any of them. An hour before closing the guy sitting with Mel went to the bathroom and Mel got up and came over. 

"Last chance" she said. 

"Sorry Mel, but you know my position on it." 

"Your loss" she said and she went back over to her table. When the guy came back they left. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

That night did cause a change in things other than in my relationship with Mel. A loud banging on my bedroom wall woke me up around four in the morning. It was the wall between Marci's bedroom and the one I was using. I heard: 

"Oh God yes, yes, yes! Fuck me hard, oh God, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me." 

The banging on the wall was the headboard of Marci's bed as whoever she had with her did his best to do what Marci asked of him. 

You want weird? Try listening to your baby girl in the throes of passion. It took me a half hour to fall back to sleep and in the morning when I woke up my plan for the day was to find me an apartment. 

Marci was fixing breakfast when I walked into the kitchen. As I poured myself a cup of coffee she smiled at me and asked me if I had slept well. I decided that she didn't need to know that she had woken me up so I just told her that I'd slept like a log. 

It was a Saturday and I spent most of it looking for an apartment and I found one that I liked and I filled out the paperwork. When I got back to Marci's she said: 

"Mom called. You need to give her a call." 

"Why?" 

"She has a contract on the house." 

"So? I'll mail her a power of attorney."  

===

"Call her daddy. It won't kill you to talk to her." 

I hadn't spoken to Iris since moving to the coast and I wasn't sure that I wanted to hear the sound of her voice. No contact with her made it easier to put what she had done in the back of my mind. I had loved the stupid bitch. Hell, I still loved her and I thought about her all the time. I even thought about her when I was making love to Anna and Mel. No; I really did not want to hear the sound of her voice. 

But Marci was on a mission and she brought me the phone and said, "Call!" 

I should have said "No!" and then got up and left the room, but I didn't. I punched in my old home number. It rang four times and then: 

"Hello?" 

"Hello Iris. Marci said you called and needed to talk to me." 

"How are you Frank?" 

"I'm okay Iris. What did you need to talk about?" 

"I miss you Frank." 

I don't know where it came from; Lord knows I didn't mean to say it, but "I miss you too Iris" was out of my mouth before I had a chance to think about it. 

"Oh God Frank; do you mean it?" 

"What did you call for Iris?" 

There was a bit of silence and then she said, "We have a buyer for the house. I waited to call until they had their financing in place. The closing is set for the 12th at 2 p.m. Can you make it?" 

"I don't know. That's only six days away. Kind of short notice, but I'll see what I can work out and call you back." 

"I hope you can make it Frank." 

"We'll see Iris. I'll call you tomorrow." 

As I hung up I was wondering why I hadn't just said that I'd Fed-Ex my power of attorney to her father or her brother. Marci saw the look on my face and said: 

"What's the matter pops? Whatcha thinking?" 

I shrugged and said, 'I'm trying to make up my mind on whether to go back or just send my power of attorney." 

"Why wouldn't you want to go back?" 

"Just the sound of your mother's voice upset me so how would I handle seeing her? I don't know if I can do it." 

"When are you going to start being honest with yourself pops." 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"I saw the look on your face when you were talking to mom. You miss her. I have no idea of what on between you two other than at the time it hurt you badly, but not being with her is taking a toll on you. I never intended to tell you this, but mom calls a couple of times a week asking about how you are. She is miserable pops. She misses the hell out of you. It's been months now pops and maybe you have healed enough to sit down with her. You need to go back daddy; it won't kill you." 

"While we are on the subject of what I need to do you need to know that I'm looking for a place of my own." 

"Why? What we have here is working." 

"For the most part it has, but it is time for me to give us both some space." 

I saw the sudden understanding register on her face and she blushed and said, "I need to check on dinner" and she hurriedly left the room. After a silent dinner Marci asked: 

"Are you going to the Grotto tonight?" 

"No. I think I'll just park myself in front of the TV for a while." 

"The ladies will be disappointed. I know a couple of them who are just itching to take Mellissa's place." 

"You aren't making any sense her little girl. On the one hand you are telling me to go back home and get with your mom and on the other you are trying to line me up with your friends at the Grotto." 

"That's not what I said. I don't know if it is even possible for you to put things back together with mom. What I was getting at was that you need some kind of closure." 

"I'm still staying in tonight. I need to pack. I found a place and all I'm waiting on is for them to do a credit check. I will probably move in on Monday or Tuesday." 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

Monday I got a call at work telling me that I had been approved so that night I started moving into my new place. I rented a two bedroom intending to make the second bedroom into a home office. Marci insisted on coming along with me and as I moved stuff in she was saying things like, "I have the perfect curtains for this room" and "Yuk! This carpet is a simply horrid color. You should ask them to replace it." She helped me set up the kitchen and then she left for home leaving me to spend my first night in my new place. 

The next day was 'settle in' time and then the day of decision was upon me. Did I go back for the closing or did I fax or Fed-Ex my power of attorney? 

I wrestled with it and in the end I decided to go back. I picked up the phone and called. 

"Hello?" 

"It's me. I've decided to come back for the closing instead of sending a power of attorney. Where is the closing?" 

"In the conference room at the First Bank on Sheppard at two. I'll make up the spare bedroom for you." 

"I don't think that would be a good idea. I'll stay at the hotel just down the street from the bank." 

"Don't be silly Frank. No need to waste money on a hotel room while you still own a four bedroom house." 

"I'll think on it. See you at the bank. Bye." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I'd done a lot of thinking since my final talk with Mellissa and I did more thinking on the flight back. Did Iris do what she did for the same reason that Mel stepped out on Royce? Was I too milk toast in the bedroom with Iris? We made love, but had we ever fucked? I couldn't remember ever being with Iris the way I was with Anna and Mellissa. Had she needed to be fucked every once in a while instead of being made love to all the time? Iris had said that the reason she did what she did was not because I was inadequate in the bedroom, but that she wanted to do something wicked and wild for once in her life. Was that a lie because she didn't want to hurt my feelings? Was the real reason she turned to Haarbauer was because she needed to be fucked? I doubted that I'd ever really know the truth of that. 

Iris was already in the conference room when I got there. She smiled when I walked into the room and stood up and started to move toward me. I quickly put the table between us and the smile faded a little. I did notice that she looked great and it was obvious that she had dressed for me. She was wearing my favorite dress and her sexiest heels and had her hair just the way I liked it. 

Before Iris could say anything other people came into the room and we got down to the business of getting all the paperwork done. When it was over I had a check in my pocket for eighty seven thousand, three hundred and sixty-two dollars. There was also thirty-six cents, but who was counting. As we were leaving the room Iris asked: 

"Are you staying at the house? We don't have to be out until the fifteenth." 

"I think not. I have some other business to take care of and then I'm going to try and catch the late flight back to the coast." 

I saw the disappointment register on her face and she said, "Are you ever going to forgive me Frank?" 

"I don't know Iris. You hurt me; you hurt me bad. Maybe it will fade in time, but I don't know. I need to be going. Goodbye Iris." 

She stood there and watched me walk away. Walking away was hard and I'll admit it. I had wanted to take her in my arms. A voice in my head was saying: 

"Lighten up Frank. She fucked a guy and then admitted it was a mistake. You are still married to her and yet you fucked Anna and Mel. One washes the other. You want her and you know you do." 

It was hard to ignore that voice but I forced myself to do it. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

At five I was parked down the block when Haarbauer came out of the building and got in his car. As I waited I was thinking about what my lawyer had been telling me about the suit against Haarbauer. Haarbauer had refused to settle and had said if we pushed it and he lost in court he would just file bankruptcy and fuck us out of any payoff. 

When Haarbauer pulled away from the curb I fell in behind him and followed him. He pulled into the parking lot at The Apollo Lounge and I pulled in right behind him. I found a parking place between his parking place and the door of the lounge and then I got out of my car and waited. He came walking toward the door and I stepped out in front of him, smiled and said: 

"Hi there Ted. Long time no see." 

He tried to turn and run, but I grabbed him, spun him around and hit him in the face as hard as I could. Blood spurted from his nose and his knees buckled. He hit the ground and I kicked him eleven hard times in his balls and then I got back in my car and left. I drove from the lounge to 1384 Meadow Brook Lane and rang the doorbell. When Janet opened the door I just handed her a copy of my conversation with Iris and said: 

"I hate to ruin your day Janet, but you need to hear what is on this tape. I'm sorry Janet. You don't deserve this" and then I turned and walked away. 

Two hours later I was on a plane flying home. 

The next morning I called my attorney and told him to drop the suit against Haarbauer. 

"After hearing what he said to you I decided to give his wife a copy of the tape and let her fuck over him." 

"Wise decision since we might not have won anyway. The courts have been kind of soft on these kinds of actions lately. The final hearing on your divorce is a week from Friday and you don't need to be here for it. Sixty days after that you will be a free man." 

Some how that news didn't fill me with Joy. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I banked the check from the sale of the house and made a mental note top start looking at condos in about four months. I had signed a six month least on my apartment so I was locked in there, but toward the end of the lease I needed to be looking for a more permanent place to live. 

The week went by quick and on Friday night I hit the Grotto. I danced with several of the ladies there, but I didn't feel like making a move on any of them. Not to say that I would pass up on them the next time, but that night I just didn't feel like doing anything. I saw Mel and she waved at me and I had a moment of regret that I'd found out she was married. I called it a night and headed on home around ten. 

Saturday night I was back at the Grotto and twenty minutes after I sat down Marci came in and sat down with me. Then some of her friends came over and joined us and we had to push a couple of tables together. The one thing that always amazed me about the Grotto was that most of the women who came into the place were self-assured and they pretty much went after what they wanted. I was asked to dance a hell of a lot more than I asked. There were three women at the table besides Marci and all three of them asked me to dance. I danced a couple of times with each of them and around eleven as I was dancing with Ruby she moved in tight against me and felt the erection that I was sporting and in a husky voice she said: 

"Anna once told me that if I ever got the chance I'd be a fool not to grab it. How about it Frank? Do I have a chance?" 

"I would be a fool if I said no." 

"Any reason why we can't leave right now?" 

"None that I can think of. Your place or mine?" 

"My place. I'm much more comfortable in my own place. At least for the first time." 

She wasn't as wild as Mel had been, but she still wore me out. When Ruby couldn't get me up again I got off the bed and reached for my trousers. 

"Where are you going?" 

"Home so you can get some sleep." 

"Nonsense. Get back down here. We haven't got to the good part yet." 

"The good part?" 

"The cuddling, snuggling and falling to sleep together. And then of course there is the waking up together." 

She was right. The waking up together was awesome. 

For the next two months Ruby and I got together two or three times a week. It was strictly a FWB relationship and Ruby and I were both aware of it. The one night Ruby almost destroyed me and as I was lying on my back gasping for breath she dropped it on me. 

"Tonight was our last night lover. I'm getting too attached to you" and just like that it was over. I was disappointed because I had gotten quite comfortable with Ruby. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

While I was with Ruby things imploded between Mellissa and Royce. Royce had gone after Mel's current boyfriend and had hurt him so bad that he put the guy in intensive care. Royce got locked up and Mel not only refused to go his bail, but had divorce papers served on him while he was in jail. 

Two weeks after Ruby turned me loose I got a call from Mel. 

"You said you wouldn't see me until Royce and I were history. Can you fit me in on Friday?" 

"Are you sure? What about the other guys you have been seeing?" 

"They are not up to your standards. Yes or no?" 

I was going to say no to an ego boost like that? "Want me to pick you up?" 

"Say seven? And be prepared for the possibility that we might not even leave my place." 

We didn't and we never fell asleep until after two in the morning. We had a morning wake up bout followed by a shower and then we headed out for breakfast at the Village Inn just down the street. We spent the weekend together and made a date for Tuesday. 

Monday my attorney called me and told me that the divorce was final. 

"I've mailed the papers and they should get to you by Thursday. You going to come back and celebrate?" 

"Not just yet, but maybe by the end of the month." 

As I hung up I realized that I had nothing to celebrate. All I felt was a sense of loss. 

The next two months were filled with work, condo hunting and Mel. Royce had been found guilty of assault with malicious intent and was serving a nine month sentence at the county work farm and Mel's divorce was moving along. She was starting to talk about what we would do when she was free and it was apparent that she was hoping I'd put a ring on her finger. I didn't say anything, but it wasn't going to happen. She was a great bed buddy, but she had freely cheated on Royce and with more than one guy. I'd be willing to keep her for years and years and years, but I'd never marry her and sooner or later I was going to have to tell her that. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Sooner came a lot quicker that I expected and I didn't have to tell her. It was more of a 'show her' than anything else. 

It was a Saturday night and Mel and I were at the Grotto. We were on the dance floor and I happened to be looking at the door when Marci came in. She wasn't alone. 

She had Iris with her. 

To say that Iris looked great would be one hell of an understatement and I must have tensed up because Mel felt it and asked if something was wrong and I told her no, that I had just felt a sudden chill. We had been sitting at a couple of shoved together tables with some of the other regulars and naturally that was where Marci headed. By the time the band had finished the number Mel and I were dancing to and announced that they were going to take a break Marci and Iris were sitting at the table. Over Mel's shoulder I saw Marci introducing Iris to the others at the table and she must have introduced her as "my mother" because I saw several quick glances my way. 

Mel and I made our way back to the table and Iris saw me coming and her face broke out in a big smile that quickly faded when she realized that the woman walking next to me was in fact with me and not just walking across the floor near me. Mel and I sat down and Iris said: 

"Hi Frank. How have you been?" 

"Not bad Iris and you?" 

"I've been better, but not for a while. You going to introduced me to your friend?" 

"Certainly. Mel, this is Iris and Iris, this is Mellissa although she prefers to be called Mel." 

"Oh come on Frank; surely you can do better than that." 

"Okay. Mel, this is Iris my ex-wife – heavy on the ex part. Iris, this is Mel. My main squeeze." 

Mel laughed and said, "Oh goodie. Maybe we can get together and exchange stories." 

From the look on Iris's face I figured it would be a cold day in hell before that happened. There was general chit chat at the table and Iris studiously avoided looking in Mel's direction and when the band returned and started the first number of their next set I grabbed Marci by the hand and pulled her out onto the dance floor. 

"What the hell is going on here?" 

"Mom called me and asked me if she could stay with me now that you have moved out and into a place of your own. I was going to say no to my mother?" 

"You don't think that maybe I should have been given some warning before you brought her in here?" 

"Probably, but she wanted to surprise you." 

"She did that all right. Damn it Marci! How could you do this to me?" 

"It was not hard pops. I happen to love both of my parents and it is easy for me to see that both of my parents still love each other and don't bother denying it. I saw your face light up for a few seconds when you first saw her walk in and God knows I've listened to her enough over the last few months to know that not being with you is killing her. If I can do anything to get the two of you back together I'm going to do it. Bringing her here tonight is just the first step." 

"You are meddling Marci." 

"I know, but like I said, I love you both and I want to see you back together." 

"No chance of that little girl – no chance at all. 

"We'll see" she said as the number ended. 

The next number was starting as we made our way back to the table and I saw a man ask Iris to dance. They moved out onto the floor as Marci and I sat down. Iris and her partner stayed out on the floor for three numbers and about half way through the third number I felt a sharp jab in my ribs. I turned and saw Mel looking at me. 

"You are supposed to be here with me not out on the dance floor with your ex." 

"What the hell are you talking about?" 

"You haven't taken your eyes off of her since she went out on the dance floor and if the look on your face is any indication you want to go out there and kill the guy she is dancing with." 

I realized that she was right. I did want to go out there and tell him to get his hands off of my wife. My wife? Where the hell did that come from? She wasn't my wife any more. 

"Call me when you decide what you really want" Mel said as she stood up. "Right now it is obvious, at least to me, that your heart is out there on the dance floor." 

She walked away and left me sitting there. 

Out on the dance floor I saw the man's hands slide down to Iris's ass and I felt a sudden rage that I didn't know I was capable of. I exploded out of my chair and was on him before he even saw me coming. I grabbed his shoulders and jerked away from Iris and said: 

"Get your filthy fucking hands off of my wife!" 

He gathered himself to come at me, but one look at my face made him think better of it and he turned and walked away. I looked at Iris and saw a bemused expression on her face. 

"Aren't you forgetting something Frank? I seem to remember a legal thing that says I'm not your wife any more." 

"He had his hands on your ass." 

"Maybe I wanted them there." 

"You want hands on your ass?!! I'll give you hands on your ass" and I grabbed her arm and drug her along as I headed for the parking lot. She stumbled and lost one of her heels, but I wouldn't stop and let her pick it up. She was saying: 

"Stop this Frank! Stop this right now. Damn it Frank, let go of me. My purse. My purse is at the table. Damn I Frank, stop this right now." 

I ignored her and pulled her outside and over to where I was parked. Fortunately it was in a dark part of the lot. I bent her over the fender of the car and pulled her dress up. 

"What are you doing Frank? Damn it; I don't want this!" 

"Tough shit Iris, I do." 

I grabbed her panties and tried to rip them off, but they wouldn't tear so I just pushed them to the side. I held her bent over the fender with my left hand in the middle of her back while I used my right to unzip and take out my cock. I pushed the head of my cock at her asshole and pushed. 

"No Frank, no! Not there Frank, not there. Please Frank. Not there."  

===

"Why not? You wanted something on your ass didn't you? Isn't that what you said? Maybe you wanted his hands on your ass?" 

"I've never done that Frank." 

"Always a first time for everything Iris. Aren't you the girl who said she wanted to do something wicked and exciting? What could be more exciting than being fucked in your ass in a bar parking lot where people can walk by and see it happening." 

"If you want my ass take me to your place and do it right. Do it Frank, but not here and not like this." 

"Get in the car Iris." 

"I need to get my purse and my other shoe." 

"Marci will take care of that. Get in the damned car." 

"Yes Frank." 

She went around and got in on the passenger side and as soon as I was in the car she slid over next to me and took hold of my cock which was still sticking out of my fly. 

"Move your seat back a little Frank." 

I did and she bent and took my cock in her mouth. She tongued it and then took her mouth off of me long enough to say: 

"Drive Frank, drive." 

She sucked on me all the way to my apartment and while doing it she managed to work her panties off. When we pulled up and parked at the apartment and I shut off the motor she said: 

"Want to do me on the back seat Frank? You've never done me on a back seat." 

"How many have?" 

"None Frank. I haven't had a man since my last time with you." 

"No backseat this time Iris; not with a perfectly good bed less than a minute away." 

I opened my door to get out and Iris giggled and grabbed my arm. "A flag pole needs a flag Frank" and she hung her panties on my erect cock. 

I fucked her! For the first time since I met her I fucked her. I did not make love to her; I fucked her and then I made her suck me hard and I took her ass. I was slow and gentle until I was all the way ion and then I fucked her hard. When it was over I pulled her into the bathroom and made her wash me and then suck me hard again. I fucked her hard one more time and then I fell to the bed next to her totally exhausted. She snuggled into me and whispered, "Thank you Frank" and then she fell asleep. A minute later I zonked out too. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

When I woke up in the morning Iris was awake sitting up in bed and watching me. When she saw that I was awake she asked: 

"Why Frank?" 

"Why what?" 

"Why last night? You couldn't wait to get rid of me, but last night you were jealous. It was all over your face Frank. I could read it and so could anyone else who was paying attention. The look fairly screamed out "That's my woman you have your hands on asshole." Am I Frank? Am I your woman?" 

"I don't know what happened last night Iris. It just happened and I don't know why." 

"Well I am glad that it did Frank. I only wish that it had happened sooner." 

She got off the bed and said, "If you'll tell me where everything is I'll fix us some breakfast." 

"There isn't anything here. I haven't gone grocery shopping yet this week. We will go out to the Village Inn, but first you had better call Marci. She might be worried." 

"I don't think so. I think what happened last night is what she was hoping would happen when she took me with her to that place. I think that you are the one who needs to make a phone call." 

"Me? Who do I need to call?" 

"The young lady you were with last night." 

"Why do I need to call her?" 

"I'm hoping that it will be to tell her that you won't be seeing her any more. I want more nights like last night Frank. Maybe another twenty or thirty years worth." 

I laid there and looked at her and suddenly realized that I wanted it too.  

===

I saw the couple back in the dark corner acting like they were out for a quiet evening together, but they were anything but. They had followed us in, taken a seat where they could watch us and hadn't taken their eyes off of us since we sat down. The might as well have been wearing signs that said "Private Detectives at Work." The 'us' they were watching? Me and my secretary Kathy. 

Actually Kathy was more of a personal assistant than a secretary and she always traveled with me when I went out of town on business. My wife's boyfriend thought that Kathy was much more and he was trying to find out for sure. He was trying to get information that he could give to Jean so she could divorce me and get a big pot of money. She obviously hasn't told him why she can't do that. 

Kathy and I had flown into Dallas/Fort Worth airport that morning to attend meetings with people from Millgard Industries and we expected to be there over night. I was sure that I recognized the blond in the watching couple from the baggage claim area at the airport. Jean's boyfriend was laying out some big bucks if he was having us followed when we were out of town, but what he didn't know was that he was wasting his money. If I fucked Kathy on the table in front of the PIs and they took pictures and he gave those pictures to Jean she would raise holy hell with him and would probably kick him to the curb. 

Kathy and I finished our dinner and I waived the waiter over and asked for the tab. Kathy got up and headed for her room and I moved to the bar. I had a few drinks and gave my watchers something to put in their report. I asked a couple of ladies to dance and I even joined one at her table for a drink. We talked for a bit and it turned out that she was a business traveler also and was just killing time in the lounge because there wasn't anything worth watching on TV. She made it plain that she wasn't there to hook up and that was okay with me because I wasn't there for that for that either. I danced twice more with her and then headed for my room. 

Once there I took a little black box out of my suitcase, switched it on and then walked around the room with it. It was a device that I'd gotten from a friend who owned a company heavily involved in security work. What it did was pick up electrical and wireless signals – a bug finder as it were. My room showed clean so I walked over to the connecting door to the next room and knocked on it three times. Thirty seconds later the door opened and there stood Kathy wearing only high heels and a smile. 

I wasn't worried about the private detectives. Kathy was registered in room 212 and I was in room 516. The connected room, 518, was rented in the name of Frank Bowers and Mr. Bowers did not exist. My lingering in the hotel lounge kept the PIs on me and allowed Kathy to go up to her room, wait fifteen minutes and then go up to room 518. If anyone would have followed her they would have seen her go into her room alone and we expected that once she was in her room they wouldn't waste any more time on her since I still had a crew on me. Kathy also had one of Alan's little black boxes and she swept her room and room 518 before I came up to my room. Why were we jumping through all those hoops? Just because! I knew for certain that the private eyes were not hired by my wife and while I assumed that their employer was Jean's boyfriend I wasn't sure. It could be a little industrial spying by one of my competitors. Either way my stance was to be better safe than sorry. 

Why was I so sure that it wasn't my wife behind the private detectives? I guess that is the story. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It started as so many other tales of woe started – by accident. I had finished my breakfast, had kissed Jean goodbye and headed off for work. Jean called after me and said: 

"Don't forget we are having dinner with Pat and Andy tonight so try and get home early. I've arranged for mom to take the kids tonight." 

As I entered the garage I hit the button to activate the garage door opener and the door opened. I got in my car and backed out of the garage and down the driveway. As I backed out onto the street I reached up and hit the button on my remote garage door opener, but the door didn't close. I hit the button a couple of more times and the door still didn't close so I pulled to the curb, got out and went back into the house. I had some nine volt batteries in the basement and from experience I knew that when the remote didn't work it was usually a dead battery. 

I went through the garage to the door into the house and as I opened it I heard Jean laugh and say: 

"The big doofus is gone. You have time to stop by for a quickie before you have to go to work?" 

"Want me in my sexy heels?" 

"I'll play with it and get it warm for you." 

"We still on for dinner tonight?" 

"Good. I love sitting with you, Frank and Pat knowing that we have just put another one over on them." 

"Okay lover; see you in fifteen" and then I heard the 'click' of the handset being put back in its cradle. 

My initial impulse was to rush in and confront Jean over what I'd just heard, but a small voice in the back of my head said: 

"Hold on hoss; best you find out all you can before you jump into her shit." 

I quietly closed the door, got in my car and drove to work. I didn't need to park down the block to see who would arrive in fifteen minutes. From what I'd overheard it had to be Andy. Andy was the husband of Jean's best friend Pat. 

I thought about the situation all the way to work and "the big doofus" worked out a plan of action. The first thing I needed to do was gather more information and I knew just how to get it. As soon as I got to the office I called Alan Audett at Audett Security Services. Alan and I had grown up together and he was the closest thing to a best friend that I'd ever had. My dad had fronted Alan the money to start his company when Alan had been discharged from the Army. In the Army Alan had been assigned to the ASA (Army Security Agency) and he had learned a lot that he thought he could use in civilian life. He told me his ideas and I had talked my dad into helping him. 

When I got through to Alan I told him what I had just found out and what I wanted to do and he said: 

"No problem. Get her out of the house and keep her gone for about two hours." 

"We are having dinner with Pat and Andy tonight. We will probably go to Duke's Steak House and it will be at least three hours before we get home." 

"I'll swing by and get a key. And Frank? I'm sorry man. I always thought you and Jean were great together." 

"I thought that too Alan; I thought that too. My problem is going to be keeping myself from going over the table after Andy and getting my hands around his throat." 

"There will be plenty of time for that later bud. Just play it cool. Earn yourself an Oscar tonight." 

Yeah I thought as I hung up, a lot easier said than done. I took up a pen and a legal pad and outlined a plan of action. First was to get more information and I'd just taken care of that with my call to Alan. Next was to protect assets and that included protecting my credit. At some point I'd have to something about the credit cards that had both Jean and me on them. I'd have to get another safe deposit box in my name only and move some things like the certificates of deposit from the box that both Jean and I had access to. I wouldn't touch the checking account, but I would close the savings account and move the money. 

We would end up splitting most of our personal assets evenly, but my largest asset couldn't be touched. When we married Jean had to sign an ironclad prenuptial agreement that precluded her from ever receiving part of the family company. My great grandfather had started the company and passed it to my grandfather who in turn passed it to my father. It was privately held and would eventually come to me. The intent of great grand dad, grand dad and my father was that the company would always remain in the hands of the family and that is why Jean had to sign the prenup. 

Item three was one word. Revenge! I didn't list anything under that heading. I had time to think about it; but it would be draconian. I promised myself that. It would indeed be draconian. 

I was putting my list away when Kathy came in and reminded me that I had a lunch meeting with John Crossfire of Crossfire Manufacturing. 

"Do you want me to go with you?" 

"I think so. Take good notes. Crossfire could turn into a good thing for us." 

As she walked out of my office I watched the way her ass moved and as always it had an effect in my lower regions. I had to admit it; I loved the ladies. I was completely faithful to Jean, but I liked to look at beautiful women so I hired a lot of them. When Kathy came in for her interview she was hired the minute she walked through the door. I didn't care if she could type or even spell. She was a walking wet dream and I wanted her in my office where I could look at her all day. Luckily Kathy was a whiz at everything and she quickly became my right hand. 

After two years with me there was no doubt in my mind that Kathy could step into my shoes and take on my job if the need arose. I smiled to myself as I thought she could easily step into Jean's shoes and assume Jean's duties also. Kathy was the one girl who could have tempted me to cheat on Jean, but fortunately cool heads had prevailed. At least until now. I quickly put that thought out of my mind. Jean's being a slut didn't mean that I had to act the same way. 

I managed to get through the day and left work a half hour early as Jean had asked. I was greeted with a kiss when I got home and Jean was already dressed and ready to go. I thought about the award winning performance I was going to have to put on at dinner that night and that led me to think of the performance Jean was putting on. She played the part of loving wife to perfection. I'd no idea that she thought that I was a 'big doofus' and it certainly hadn't shown in the bedroom. Our love life had been great. I'd seen absolutely no loss of love or affection and that prompted another thought. How many times had I followed Andy into Jean? How many times had she given me sloppy seconds? How many times had she kissed me with the taste of Andy's cock still in her mouth? 

Was I going to be able to have sex (not make love) with her knowing what I now knew? I was going to have to if I didn't want her to start thinking that I might know something. I needed everything to appear normal until I got the information that I wanted. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Dinner was the same as it had been the dozens of other times that the four of us had gotten together except this time the 'big doofus' was aware of what Andy and Jean were up to. Knowing changed things a little. Now I was looking for the subtle signs that I knew would be there. As always Jean sat beside me in the booth and Pat and Andy sat on the other side with Andy opposite Jean. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a slight moment of Jean's leg and at the same time a trace of a grin flashed across Andy's face. I wondered if Jean's foot was playing footsie with Andy or if maybe it was higher up and in his crotch. It was something that I would never have noticed before overhearing that phone conversation. 

After dinner we went to the Black Hole for drinks and some dancing. Andy danced with Jean and they kept it circumspect probably because Pat and I were there. I danced with Pat and as I held her I wondered if she had any inkling that Andy was cheating on her. If she did I would bet she would never even give a remote thought to the idea that it would be with her best friend. Jean and Pat had been best friends since meeting in the second grade and I wondered how Jean could stab Pat in the back. It would be interesting to see what Pat would do when she found out about Jean and Andy and she would find out. I would see to that. 

We called it a night and headed home and on the way Jean slid over next to me and started rubbing my crotch and the predictable happened. Jean laughed, unzipped me, took out my cock and started playing with it as she said: 

"I hope you can figure out what I want to do when we get home." 

I figured it out all right, but I wondered why. Was it because she had already fucked Andy earlier in the day and got a kick out of giving me seconds? I'm sure that they wouldn't be sloppy, but I would still be the second man in. Maybe when I hadn't been looking she had turned into a nymphomaniac. Nah! I'd bet on it being a kick for her to be giving me Andy's leftovers. I got semi- confirmation of that when we pulled into the garage. Jean let go of my cock and said: 

"Do you know you haven't kissed me all night?" 

The bitch wanted to kiss me with the mouth that had been sucking Andy's dick. I didn't want to do it, but I had to play the game and keep her from thinking I might know something that she didn't want me to know. I screwed up my mental capabilities to fight the urge to barf and I kissed her. I didn't taste anything odd so I guessed it was just the idea of my kissing her mouth after she'd had Andy's cock in that she wanted. 

She was a tiger in bed that night and while she might have thought I was making love to her I wasn't. What I was doing was fucking a slut. I fucked her as hard as I could while thinking of all the other women I had looked at and wished that I could have had sex with. My mind was filled with images of big titted Wendy Potter when I pushed my load into Jean. 

Jean let me rest a bit and then she slid down and took my cock in her mouth and as she worked to get me up again I wondered if she had ever kissed Andy after having my cock in her mouth. She got me up again and moved into the doggie position which was her favorite. As I pushed into her I was looking down at her 'brown eye' and I had a mean thought. Jean didn't care for anal (from me anyway - who knows about Andy) but she never refused me if I wanted it. Knowing that she didn't care for it I never pushed for it, but that was before me finding out that she was a back stabbing slut. 

I pulled my cock out of her cheating cunt and stuck my thumb in it to get some juice on it and then I plunged my cock back into her and as I fucked the cheating bitch I worked my thumb into her ass. 

"What are you doing Frank" she panted. 

"Getting your sexy ass ready." 

"I don't want that Frank." 

"But I do Jean" and I pulled my cock out of her cunt and pushed it at her asshole. 

"No Frank. No!" 

"Yes Jean, yes" and I pushed into her butt. It wasn't easy since I hadn't spent much time at all getting it ready, but I was in and that was all that mattered, at least to me. Jean gave a sharp little cry and tried to pull away, but I held her fast as I started plunging away. Not being a total asshole I reached under and started manipulating her clit. After a bit she started moaning and fucking back at me. Several minutes later I sent my load deep into her poop chute and then pulled out and went into the bathroom and washed my cock. When I came back she was under the covers which I guess was her way of saying that we were done for the night. 

As I moved under the covers Jean asked, "Why did you do that?" 

"Do what?" 

"What I told you I didn't want." 

"You don't want to know." 

"Yes I do." 

"You won't like it." 

"I didn't like what you did so it won't matter if I like it or not." 

"Lately I've gotten the feeling that there is something different between us. Almost like something else is taking my place in your life. I just thought that maybe it was time for the Alpha male in me to come out and reassert itself." 

"Alpha male? You are kidding me right? Besides, there isn't anything wrong or different between us. If you think there is it is just your imagination at work." 

"I don't know babe; I just have a feeling that something, I'm not sure what, is different." 

"So just because you have a feeling you get to brutalize my butt?" 

"Hey! You got into it. Toward the end you were pushing back harder than I was pushing in." 

"That doesn't change the fact that I didn't want it." 

"But the Alpha male did and every once in a while he is going to get his way. And speaking of a feeling. Did you get the vibe that something isn't right between Pat and Andy?" 

"No, of course not and believe me Pat would certainly tell me if there was. We have no secrets from each other." 

I almost choked when she said that, but I held it in and said, "You want to go to the lake this weekend?" 

"That would be nice. The kids love it there." 

"Okay then, plan on it." 

She was still a little too pissed at me to snuggle up, but I was just as happy that she didn't. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got to the office in the morning Kathy called me and told me that Alan had called and that he would like me to call him as soon as I got in. 

"We got a bonus last night" Alan said when I got him on the phone. There was a cell phone on the kitchen counter being charged and since I know you are never without yours I figured it was Jean's. I put a bug in it so now her cell, your house phones and her car are covered. I need to show you where the hidden switch to the master bedroom camera is so you can have some privacy when it is you in there." 

"Have they been tested?" 

"Of course they have you nasty Alpha male you." 

"You caught that?" 

"Oh yeah. They are wireless and are motion and sound activated. They send to a remote that in turn sends them to the machines in my shop. If anything goes on in your house it is covered." 

"Thanks Alan." 

"No problem bud; glad I could help." 

"Unless something earth shattering comes up why don't we plan on lunch every Friday so you can bring me up to date." 

"You got it. Talk at you later. Bye." 

The rest of the week flew by and I did a credible job of acting as the loving husband. We fucked (making love was a thing of the past) on Thursday and on Friday I met Alan for lunch. 

"Nothing earth shaking bud" he said as he slid me an envelope containing the evidence so far collected. "Even as we speak she is having lunch in your bedroom with the asswipe. From what we have gathered it looks like it has been going on for years. How many I've no idea, but it is obvious that it isn't a recent thing. Maybe something on the CDs will trigger something that will give you a clue as to how long it has been going on. On the good side they haven't been plotting your death although they have been planning on divorces for the both of them. There haven't been any specifics yet, but it sounds like they are waiting for something financial to happen." 

"They won't be getting anything from me. I've got an ironclad pre-nup covering the most important things." 

"Don't know bud. Maybe it will come out in the next couple of weeks. They are pretty sure that they are covering their track and that neither you nor his wife have a clue although you did give her a bad moment on your Alpha male night. When she talked to him the next day she told him about what happened and said she was worried that you might be suspicious of something. He convinced her that all it was was you being an insecure husband who felt the need to assert himself. You decided what you are going to do yet?" 

"Not yet. I want a hell of a lot of information before I make a decision. I want you to keep collecting, but is there some way you can set it up so I can access the information without waiting for the Friday lunches?" 

"No problem. I can give you the feed from the cameras in the house, but not the product from the phone bugs and the car bug. You want it at home or the office?" 

"The office. I don't want to risk her finding anything that will clue her in to the fact that I know what she is doing." 

Alan slid a small box over to me. "These are bugs that you can put in her purses. If she is like most women she has one or two favorites that she always tends to use."  

===

I went back to the office and since I had a clear schedule I went down to the conference room and got the audio-visual cart and pushed it to my office. The cart was set up with a large screen TV and the necessary equipment to play cassette tapes, CDs and DVDs. I told Kathy I didn't want to be disturbed unless it was a catastrophic emergency and then I settled in to watch the CDs Alan had given me. 

There was nothing of interest on the phone taps other than Jean's worries following my Alpha male performance. Most of it was setting up times for meetings and exchanges of "I miss you" and "I can't wait to see you again." 

The visuals were uninspiring. Frankly I'd seen better porn and after watching the two of them I thought that I fucked her a hell of a lot better than he did. There was one thing that pissed me off severally. It seemed that Jean only disliked anal with me because she gave it up to Andy almost every time they got together. In fact she apologized to him for my getting something that was only supposed to be his. 

The one thing I expected to see that I didn't was me being trashed. After hearing myself being referred to as "The big doofus" in the overheard conversation I expected that I would be shot through the grease by them. I learned nothing from that week's batch that told me anything about the why and when they got started. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The weekend was sex free as Jean, the kids and I slept in the tent at the lake. Monday I was too busy to check on the camera feeds from the house and Tuesday I took a quick one day trip that didn't allow me to check in on Jean's doings. I checked the feed from time to time on Wednesday, but didn't catch anything. 

It was going to be hit and miss because Andy sold real estate and could leave his office and visit Jean whenever he felt like it and I couldn't stay glued to the computer all day. Thursday I managed to catch them finishing up and getting dressed, but I'd have to wait for my Friday lunch date with Alan to find out what they talked about. 

Jean wanted to make love Thursday night so I came to the conclusion that she enjoyed giving me Andy's leftovers. If I was right she fucked Andy on Tuesday because she wanted to make love Tuesday night. 

When I had lunch with Alan he told me that the weeks take was pretty lackluster. They had met Tuesday as I had surmised and of course there was the day before. 

"How long do you want to keep going? You have enough by now to burn her." 

"I probably do, but I'm hoping for some information that will give me an idea of when and why they started and I'm curious about the financial thing they are waiting on before they go for divorces. Lets give it a couple of more weeks and if we don't have anything by then I'll end it." 

Jean wanted to make love that night and I was beginning to see a pattern. She wanted to make love on the nights she had spent the day with Andy. I obliged her with a hard and fast fuck and then fell asleep. 

Saturday she told me she was going to do some shopping for clothes and asked me if I would mind watching the kids. I of course didn't and we had a fun day together. Jean got home around seven with a bunch of shopping bags and packages so I guess she did do some shopping, but she wanted to make love that night and that told me that she hadn't spent all of her time in stores. 

Since I'd found out about her and Andy – with the exception of my 'Alpha night' – I'd made no moves to start the sexual dance with Jean; I just followed her lead. I wondered if sooner or later she would notice that and if she did would it make her wonder. I decided that I needed to be the one to start things every once in a while so Sunday night I made overtures and got: 

"Not tonight honey. I've had a bad day and I just want to go soak in the tub." 

It was a first. She had never refused me before. 

That night I did something I'd been putting off because quite frankly, I wasn't sure that I really wanted to know. After Jean and the kids were asleep I got out of bed and went to the kids rooms. I gently opened their mouths and swabbed the insides of their cheeks. I dropped them off at a lab the next day so DNA tests could be run and told them I'd pay extra for expedited results. 

That night Jean wanted to make love so I assumed that she had been with Andy earlier in the day. That was confirmed the next morning when Alan called me. 

"We've got something. They met yesterday and I think you need to see it before Friday. I'll messenger it over to you." 

At ten fifteen I had a CD in my hand and I headed for the conference room to use the audio-video set up. As usual the sex was uninspiring, but the conversation as they were dressing was enlightening. 

"How much longer until we can pull the plug" Jean asked. 

"It hasn't changed any since the last time you asked. Pat doesn't come into her trust fund until she reaches thirty-five and that's still two years away. Anything on your end? Frank's dad any closer to handing the company over to Frank?" 

"Doesn't seem likely. The old fart is as healthy as a horse." 

"Well then, since you won't be able to suck anything out of Frank we are stuck waiting for Pat to turn thirty-five." 

"Why don't we just say to hell with it and do it? I'll get the kids in the divorce and I'm sure the courts will give me the house until they turn eighteen. I'll get a nice chunk of alimony and half of our assets and that's a lot." 

"I'm not walking away from a chance to get half of Pat's five million. It is only two more years – nineteen months actually – and we have already waited six years so what's two more?" 

"We've been lucky and I'm just afraid that our luck won't hold. I want to end things on my terms and not Frank's." 

"So cross your fingers and hope that Frank's dad kicks off or retires in the next couple of months. The pre-nup keeps you from getting any part of the company, but once Frank takes control of the company his net worth goes up and your half of the assets could double." 

"I still think we need to do it now." 

"You worry too much love; we are going to be okay." 

I clicked it off and then heard "You poor guy." 

I turned and saw Kathy standing there. "I'm sorry boss, didn't mean to intrude, but the door wasn't locked and I needed to remind you of your afternoon appointment with Gilmer over at Apex Products." 

"How long have you been there?" 

"Almost from the beginning. You were so rapt on watching that I guess you didn't hear me come in. When I saw what you were watching I should have quietly left, but I couldn't tear myself away. How long have you known?" 

"Far longer than I've wanted to. This stays between us right?" 

"You know me boss. You know I've got your back. What are you going to do?" 

"Not sure yet. I need a little more information before I decide." 

"Anything I can do just let me know okay?" 

"Thanks Kathy." 

As I ejected the CD the beginnings of a plan began to form in my mind. There were problems with it, but if they could be worked out it just might work. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next week went by and on Thursday I stopped by the lab to see if they had the results of the DNA tests and they did. According to the tests the kids were mine. That made a difference in the plan I had been working on and the information gave me the boost I needed to get something going. I was going to attack through the back door if I could manage it. I'd sink them and they wouldn't even know it was me that did it. 

The hard part was going to be sitting down with Pat and not have Andy and Jean know about it. The only way I could do that was catch Pat alone. Fortunately I had a way I could do that. Pat was a mid-level manager in a company we did business with and I called on them occasionally. When I did I usually swung by Pat's office and offered to take her to lunch. I hated to do it to her, but she needed to know what kind of an asshole she was married to and she needed to know about his plan to screw over her. 

I hit Milford Manufacturing at 11:15 and talked to Marv, the purchasing agent, and then I looked in on Pat. 

"Got time for lunch?" 

"With you? Anytime." 

We got in my car and drove off. When she saw I was heading away from where the restaurants were she asked where we were going and I told her it was a surprise. She looked at me in confusion when we pulled into my assigned parking space at work and I told her it would all be clear in just a few minutes. I led her into the conference room after telling Kathy that we were not to be disturbed for any reason. I locked the door and said: 

"I hate to be the one to do this to you and you might never want to speak to me again, but this has to be done." 

"Why wouldn't I ever want to speak to you again?" 

"They used to kill the messenger who brought the bad news." 

"Bad news?" 

"The worst; the absolute worst." 

I pushed a CD into the audio-visual unit and hit play. The screen lit up and Pat could see Andy fucking her best friend. She stood there stunned and then said: 

"This is some kind of a joke right?" 

I shook my head no. I ejected the CD and inserted another. That one had Andy and Jean in a sixty-nine and I said: 

"I have three weeks worth of this trash and I probably wouldn't have let you know about it until I decided what I was going to do, but yesterday this happened and I felt you needed to know so that you could decide what you wanted to do." 

I ejected the CD playing and inserted the one that Alan had messengered over to me. She watched it and then said: 

"That miserable motherfucking son of a bitch. That rotten two-faced scum sucking bastard! And that bitch!! I would have died for her" and then she broke down and started sobbing. I took her in my arms and tried to comfort her even though I knew it was impossible. I'd just destroyed her world and I knew exactly how she was feeling. 

"It sucks sweetie and I know it, but the question now is what do we do about it?" 

"What are you going to do?" 

"I had considered doing nothing and just letting things ride until the kids turn eighteen. If I divorce the cheating whore she will get the kids and I'll end up being a part time dad and your asshole husband will be living with them and be a major influence on their growing up. Once I heard their plan for you I had to rethink things. I had to let you know while you still had time to do something." 

"What do you mean?" 

"You have almost two years before you get your trust. I don't know what is in your mind. You might love the worthless bastard and want to fight for him for all I know. But my showing you this CD gives you ample time to divorce him before you come into your money. So like I said; you have time to do something." 

"If I divorce him that brings Jean into it so you can no longer pretend you don't know what's going on. That means a divorce for you and you lose your kids." 

"Maybe, but then again maybe not." 

"What does that mean?" 

"If you don't use the material I've already gathered Jean won't know that I know. We can put a private detective on Andy and use what he finds out. I know that Jean leaves the house on the weekends to go shopping and that she meets Andy. The next time they do it the detective will be on them and we can use his material to go after Andy. You can spit in Jean's eye and then tell her that you aren't going to tell me because you don't want to hurt me or the kids. That way I could sit on my material until I'm ready to burn her. Of course it may not work that way. She just might say "Fuck Frank; I want to be rid of him anyway." 

"I just don't know. It's a crap shoot. She might run to me and confess and beg me to forgive her and tell me a bunch of lies about how she never really meant to yadda, yadda, yadda. If she did I'd probably pretend to forgive her at least until the kids were old enough to leave home. I just don't know. There is no way to predict what will happen. I don't know how long I would have sat on it if I hadn't heard Andy's plan for you." 

"How did you ever get onto them in the first place?" 

I told her about the overheard phone conversation and what I'd done after hearing it. She shook her head in disgust and said: 

"I just wish I knew how long it has been going on." 

"I have one recording that says six years." 

"I just want to know how long that two faced bitch has been pretending to be my best friend while stabbing me in the back." 

She looked at her watch and told me that she had to be getting back to work. On the drive back she told me that she was going to go the private detective route and that she'd be in touch and I told her if I got any further information I'd see that it got to her. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Over the next three weeks everything pretty much stayed the same. On two weekends Jean asked me to watch the kids while she went shopping and on both nights she wanted to make love. There was only twice during those three weeks that we had sex when she hadn't been with Andy earlier in the day and both were because I pushed for it. Both times I was told that she really didn't feel like it and both times I said, "I guess I'll have to go into Alpha male mode again" and she gave in. I guess she figured that 'Alpha male mode' meant that I'd take her ass and she had to keep that just for Andy. 

At the end of that three week period I got a call from Pat. 

"I've got all I need to go after Andy. You were right. They did get together on weekends and while my PI didn't get any bedroom footage of them at the motel he did get pictures of them holding hands, hugging and kissing and going into and coming out of motel rooms together. He did get some good footage through your living room windows though. I'm going to see an attorney this afternoon and hopefully I'll have him served in a couple of days. I'll call you and let you know when. You should get some pretty interesting audio out of it after it happens." 

That conversation prompted the next move on my part. That night over dinner I told Jean that we needed to start watching our finances. 

"Because of the bad economy the company is having to make some moves to insure survival. My pay has been cut by a little over a third so we are going to have to start pinching pennies and watching what we spend. We will have to cut back on some things. I talked to the bank this morning about taking out a second on the house to help us get through this. I don't know how long that pay cut will stay in place and there might even be further pay cuts before it is over." 

That night for the first time since I'd found out about Andy Jean didn't want to make love even though she had spent three hours with Andy that afternoon. 

Two days went by and I got a call from Pat. 

"Today is D Day. I had a friend call Andy and make an appointment to discuss selling her house so he will be pinned in place at three which is when he will be served. Also at three I'll be stopping by your house to pay the whore a surprise visit. I'm going to make her an offer she'd be smart not to refuse. If she takes it you might be able to hang on for a while." 

I called Alan and told him what was going down and told him that I was going to stay late at the office and I wanted him to messenger me whatever he picked up on the phone taps after three. It was Thursday and I could have waited until our Friday lunch, but I didn't want to wait. I could watch Pat's visit live, but I wanted to hear the phone conversations that would take place after Andy was served. 

At three I was on my computer monitor watching Jean putter around cleaning house. The door bell rang and she went to the door, opened it and smiled when she saw Pat standing there. The smile disappeared when Pat slapped her so hard that Jean staggered backwards and almost fell down. Pat stepped into the house and screamed: 

"You worthless backstabbing two-faced cunt! How could you pretend to be my best friend while fucking my husband and don't even bother trying to deny it. I've had a private detective on Andy for two weeks and I've got both of your Saturday motel visits on film along with the six times he was here. You really should close your curtains or blinds if you are going to fuck in your living room. It would have kept my detective from being able to take pictures. 

"It goes without saying that you are dead to me and when I leave here I don't ever want to hear your voice or see your face again. By all rights I should hang you out to dry, but apparently I think more of your husband and kids than you do so I'm going to give you one chance to keep from ruining your husbands and your kid's lives. When you talk to that worthless piece of shit I'm married to you had better convince him not to fight the divorce. If you don't convince him and he fights I'll see to it that Frank gets a copy of everything that I have." 

She stood there staring at Jean for several seconds and then she said, "I still can't believe that you did this to me" and then she turned and walked out. Jean rushed to the window and watched Pat get in her car and back out of the driveway. I could see the anguish on her face as it dawned on her that she had just lost her best friend and I couldn't help but wonder at her thinking. Surely she had t know she would have lost Pat as her best friend when she hooked up with Andy after Andy's divorce from Pat. If she was going to get upset at losing Pat's friendship why had she started playing with Andy in the first place? 

I turned off the live feed and got back to work. If I'd have kept watching I'd have only heard her side of any phone conversations she might have had. I'd just wait until I could hear both sides. 

I didn't have long to wait. At four-forty Alan called and said that he had something good and would be sending it right over. Twenty minutes later I was listening to Jean and her lover. 

"Hello?" 

"It's me. We have a problem." 

"I know." 

"You do?" 

"Pat was here half an hour ago. She knows about us." 

"I know. I was just served with divorce papers and a restraining order. I guess you need to get ready to face Frank because I'm sure that she will clue him in." 

"Maybe not. After she hit me she told me that she wouldn't tell Frank if I could convince you not to fight the divorce." 

"How could I fight her? She's got me cold. Pictures and everything." 

"I don't know. All I know is that she told me if I talked you into not fighting she wouldn't tell Frank." 

"I'm not going to fight especially when I know I can't win so it looks like you are safe. As long as Pat was telling you the truth." 

"Why would she lie?" 

"Woman scorned and all that. Maybe lull you into a false sense of security so it would be a big shock to you when Frank hit you with it. Anyway, this changes things." 

"How?" 

"We don't have to wait until she gets her trust fund now. What we need to do now is concentrate on your getting as much out of Frank as you can get." 

"That might not be too easy. Right now according to Rob we are in financial trouble. The economy is so bad that the company cut Frank's wages by a third and he is talking to the bank about refinancing the house to keep things going. What are we going to do?" 

"I don't know. I was counting on what I could get from Pat and what you could get from Frank to set us up. I don't have a fall back plan. I'm going to be barely able to take care of myself on what I'm making at the agency. The economy has really killed the real estate market. I guess you will have to hang in there with Frank until the economy improves or I can think of something. I'll call you later." 

"Will I see you tomorrow?" 

"I don't know. Now that I don't have Pat's income to supplement mine I'm going to have to work a lot harder at trying to get listings and sell houses. I won't be able to get loose during the day the way I have been. We will work something out. Just give me a little time to figure it out."  

===

I was smiling when I turned off the CD. Time for the next step. One of the things that I learned from Alan was that in his business he met and made friends with some pretty shady characters. By shady I meant that some of the things they did were not legal and above board and some of them would do almost anything if the money was right. I called Alan and told him what I wanted and he told me that it was doable and that he would get back to me. Two hours later he called me back with a name and a phone number. Three hours later in the back room of a bar on the east side of town a deal was struck and I left the place two thousand dollars poorer. I called Pat on my cell and gave her a heads up and headed home. 

When I got home, knowing that Jean hadn't seen Andy that day, I pushed for sex and got what I usually got on days when she hadn't fucked her lover. 

"Not tonight Frank. I've had a really bad day." 

"You know Jean; I'm getting pretty tired of hearing that from you lately whenever I want to make love. Tell you what. You keep it and let it grow shut for all I care" and I grabbed my pillow off the bed and went down to my home office to sleep on the leather couch. I'd go back to sleeping in the bedroom the next night, but sex with Jean was as good as over. She would have to beg me before I'd do her again. But I wasn't going to go without. No sir; I was not going to go without. 

The next morning on the way to work I stopped and bought one of those alternative newspapers. You know the ones. The kind loaded with ads for strip clubs, adult theatres, adult bookstores and the like. I was going to make a list of escort services, check a few of them out and see if I couldn't work out something with one of them. I was making the list when the phone rang. It was my dad and he asked me to come up to his office. I went up to the fourth floor and walked into his large corner office. Myrna, his secretary, waved me on in. I was surprised to find my mother in the office with him. 

"You ready to try your hand at running the company?" 

"Why? What's up?" 

"Your mother and I have decided to go on a three week cruise and depending on how things go it could stretch out to five or six weeks or maybe even longer. You have been left in charge when I've taken a weeks vacation, but that was more of being a caretaker than running things. This time you get to do it all. Make all the decisions. Put out all the fires. You up to it?" 

"When do I start?" 

"We fly out to Florida Friday night so it is in your hands when I leave the building on Friday." 

"Okay. While you are both here I need to bring you up to date on a few things." 

I told them all about my situation with Jean and I told them about the lie I'd told her about taking a pay cut and maybe even having to take a bigger one. 

"Whenever she is around either of you I need for you to back me up on how bad the economy is hurting the company." 

"But the company is doing fine." 

"I know, but I'm trying to make her think that she won't come out of a divorce with much. A divorce would cost me the kids and I don't want that. I'll try to keep us together until the kids are old enough to choose which parent they want to stay with or until they are old enough to strike out on their own." 

"We will help any way we can" my dad said. 

"I can't believe that Jean did that" my mother said. "I've always thought well of her." 

"Who do you want to run your department while you run the company?" 

"I think I'll give Kathy a chance at it." 

"Do you think that's wise? She hasn't had much – oh the hell with it. I did say that you would be in charge so I'm not going to interfere." 

When I got back to my office Kathy followed me in. She pointed at the center of my desk and asked: 

"What's this?" 

She was pointing at the page of the newspaper advertising escort agencies and my list lying next to it. 

"She cut you off and you are looking for a replacement?" 

"That's half right. I cut her off not the other way around." 

"Why are you looking for a professional to take her place?" 

"I have needs and I'm not the type to prowl bars looking for one night stands." 

"There is a solution to your problem a lot closer." 

"Oh? And what would that be?" 

She started unbuttoning her blouse as she said, "I'm sure that you will figure it out." 

I did and in less than a micro second. It took me a little longer than that to get up and lock the door. By the time I got the door locked Kathy was lying on her back on my desk, panties off, legs spread wide and a 'come hither' smile on her face. She was hot, she was wild and she wrapped herself around me and fucked my socks off. I came in her harder than I had ever come in my life. As we straightened ourselves up I asked: 

"Why?" 

"I've been hung up on you since the day I started working for you. I've wanted you so bad I could scream, but you were happily married and I'm no home wrecker. It was going to be a case of unrequited love until the day I saw that CD you were watching. Since then I've just been waiting for my chance; waiting for an occasion when I could make my desires known and today that paper on your desk gave me that. You might want to get a couch for your office since your desk isn't all that comfortable." 

"You mean that this isn't just a one time deal?" 

"I sure hope to God not." 

"You see yourself as the next Mrs. Englewood?" 

"No, at least not yet. I think we would be a hell of a good fit, but outside of work and our interaction here I know nothing about you or you me. Based on what just happened I'd say that we are sexually compatible, but there is more to a relationship than good sex. I am interested in seeing if there is anything else there." 

"Well don't get your hopes up. It may take a while for me to get rid of the first Mrs. Englewood. Ten years in fact. My current thoughts are to stay married to the bitch until my kids are grown. I don't want to lose them in a divorce." 

"Ten years? That should give us enough time to see if we are compatible. When can we do this again?" 

"I don't think we want to make it a habit of doing it here at work and I'll need to get a few things in place before we can do it some place else. Also, you may be too busy for us to get together again for a while." 

"Why would that be?" 

"Because this Friday at four p.m. you will be in charge of this department" and I went on to explain what was going to happen. 

"You really think I can handle it?" 

"I wouldn't give you the chance if I thought you couldn't. If you do as well as I think you will you will get the job full time when my dad finally decides to retire and I move up." 

"Damn! I never expected something like this to happen. Isn't it going to piss off some that think they should have gotten the job?" 

"Probably, but so what? They might think they should have gotten the job based on seniority or whatever, but the simple fact is that no one else in the department has what it takes to do the job. If they give you any problems handle it and I'll back you." 

She was silent for a couple of moments and then she said, "You have never been to my apartment. Would you like to come over and see my etchings?" 

"You have etchings?" 

She just smiled and I said, "How about I take a look at them tomorrow. Maybe we can leave work early so I can take more time to look at them." 

"You got it boss man." 

When I got home Jean had dinner ready and we didn't speak much to each other. Table conversation was mostly the kids telling us about their day at school. After dinner I helped Maryanne with her homework and then I spent some time down in the basement workshop working with Jamie on the model aircraft carrier he was building. After the kids went to bed I spent an hour in my home office going over some contracts that I'd brought home to study. 

Jean was already in bed when I got there and after pulling the covers over me I rolled over and put my back to her. That had to get her attention because even on nights when we never made love I always snuggled and cuddled. I knew that she wouldn't initiate sex because Andy hadn't stopped by that day. If things went as planned it would be a long while before she ever tried to initiate sex especially if having been fucked by Andy is what it took to trigger it. For my side I never, ever intended to try to get something going. 

The next day Kathy and I left work an hour early and we went to her apartment. She had lied to me. She didn't have any etchings, but she did manage to show me some things and those things kept me busy until eight at which time I had to head on home. I'd called Jean and told her I would be working late and not to bother holding dinner for me. 

When I got home I played with the kids until it was their bedtime and then I watched some TV for an hour or so before going to bed. It was a repeat of the previous night – no snuggling or cuddling – and even though I hadn't watched any of the live feed from the house that day it was obvious that Andy hadn't been by since Jean made no effort to start anything. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

At ten the next morning I got a call from Pat. "Thank you Frank; it did my heart good." 

"Of course I have no idea of what you are talking about, but you are welcome." 

"Call me. Maybe we can have dinner some night." 

"I'd like that. I'll be in touch." 

Half an hour later Alan called and said simply, "It's done." 

"I know. His wife just called me." 

"The hospital must have called her." 

"I'd like to ask, but I think I'll wait until I hear about it through normal channels. Don't want to seem like I know too much too soon." 

"Bullshit! That could take weeks. Seems like he got mugged and decided to put up a fight. Bad move on his part. Two crushed knees, a fractured elbow, a broken nose and a couple of missing teeth and from what I hear whoever mugged him did a number on his crotch bad enough that he will probably lose at least one testicle." 

"Oh my, what a shame." 

"Yeah, right!" 

When I got home that night over dinner I said. "I talked to Pat today." Jean's face lost some of its color and I went on. "I stopped by Milford to talk with the purchasing agent and while I was there I asked Pat to lunch. I also asked her if she and Andy would like to come over for a barbecue on Sunday. Why didn't you tell me that she had kicked him out?" 

She was silent for a moment and then she said, "I thought that I had." 

"I must have been doing something else and missed it. I can't believe it. Why would Andy cheat on a woman like Pat? She's smart, witty and sexy looking. I'd be interested in seeing what he thought might be better. Anyway, I asked her over and told her that we would cheer her up, but she said no. Odd that. She has never, at least in my memory, turned down an invitation from us. She must really be hurting if she can do that. She give you any idea of who the other woman was?" 

"No. She was too upset to talk about it." 

"Oh well, it will come out sooner or later." 

After dinner I played Monopoly with the kids until it was their bedtime and then I read for a while before going to bed. I was in bed when Jean joined me and when she got in beside me she reached over and put her hand on my leg and started moving it upward. I rolled away and put my back to her as I mumbled "goodnight." 

In the morning I told Jean that Eldridge from TPM would be in town for contract negotiations and I'd probably take him to dinner so not to look for me until late. There was no Eldridge of course and it was Kathy I took to dinner. We had dessert – lots of dessert – at her apartment later. I got home around eleven and found Jean waiting up for me. 

"We haven't made love in more than a week and I'm more than ready. Come on baby; make love to me." 

I'd said that Jean would have to beg to get me to fuck her and while that wasn't actually begging it was close enough and I decided to do her, but I had an ulterior motive. I was fresh from doing Kathy and I hadn't showered yet so Kathy's dried juices were still on my dick. Given all the times I had been given Andy's leftovers I thought that it was only fair that I rub Kathy's residue off inside Jean's cunt. 

I really wanted Jean to suck my cock and get a taste of Kathy, but sanity prevailed. She just might have noticed the taste and wondered about it. I didn't want Jean getting suspicious. Kathy hadn't left much in me, but I had enough to get Jean off once before I rolled over and went to sleep. 

In the morning over breakfast I said, "Pat got to the husband of the woman that Andy was fucking." Jean's face tightened and I went on, "The hubby must not have had much of a sense of humor. He put Andy in the hospital. Really did a number on him." I saw concern on Jean's face and I forged ahead. "I hear that he is in traction because of all the broken bones and that they had to remove his testicles. Guess he won't be going after any other married women. Did you talk to Pat yesterday? Did she tell you who the woman is?" 

"She hasn't told me." 

"Oh come on Jean. She tells you everything and you tell her everything. I'd be willing to be that you have even talked about your husbands cock sizes. Am I right? How do I compare to Andy?" 

"That's disgusting Frank." 

"Jesus Jean; what's come over you? You used to have a sense of humor." 

I got up from the table and headed for work. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was Friday and I met with Alan for lunch and he gave me a single CD. 

"Not much on it. A dozen phone calls from the house and her cell to the asswipe. She wanted to know when he would be coming over and he kept putting her off. The last two days she couldn't get him at all and of course we know why. She called the real estate office a half dozen times and all they would tell her was that he wasn't in. She tried calling his cell, but of course he doesn't answer." 

"She knows why now. I told her over breakfast that I'd heard that he was in the hospital and hurt pretty bad. I told her that Pat must have gotten to the husband of the woman Andy was fucking and the woman's husband went after Andy." 

"I guess that's basically true." He chuckled as he said, "It was the husband behind it." 

We both laughed and Alan asked, "What now?" 

"That's up to Jean. I don't plan on letting her know that I know. I'll hang with the bitch until the kids turn eighteen and then kick her out. Of course she might have other ideas. She was so dissatisfied with me that she took up with Andy so she might just pull the plug and end it. If that is the way it goes I'll threaten to let everyone in the world see the audio and video we have collected unless she agrees to my terms in the divorce. I've no idea how things are going to bounce. It will be a just wait and see thing. 

"All I can do is wish you luck bud. Should I pull the equipment?" 

"No. Leave it in place. I'm still going to want to know what she does. Just let me know if anything interesting comes up otherwise we can wait until our Friday lunch date." 

I spent the afternoon with my dad being brought up to date on some of the things I needed to know when I took the reins. At five he stood up and said: 

"Its all yours Frank. See you when your mother decides that she's had enough and just to give you a bit of a heads up that might never happen." 

He left and I called down to my old office and asked Kathy to come up. Myrna had gone home at five so Kathy's coming up wouldn't get any gossip started not that there should have been any anyway. After all, I was in charge and Kathy was one of my department heads. It would be perfectly reasonable for me to call those reporting to me up to my office. 

Kathy came in and said, "You rang boss?" 

"Yes I did. There is something lacking in this room and I thought that maybe a woman's view could tell me what's wrong. I already think I know but I want a second opinion – a woman's opinion." 

She looked around and then said, "The color on the walls needs to be brighter." 

"That's it? That's the best you can come up with?" 

She shrugged and I said, "I'm disappointed in you Kathy. The first thought to enter your mind should have been "I've never been laid on that desk." 

She smiled and started to unbutton her blouse. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Jean seemed out of sorts when I got home and I figured that it was because her lover was in the hospital and in pretty bad shape. She had to be thinking "If Pat could do that to Andy what is she going to do to me? She said she wouldn't tell Frank, but she never said that she wouldn't take some kind of revenge against me." 

I acted like I didn't notice. After dinner I played with the kids and we made plans to go to the amusement park the next day. Jean was in bed when I went up and when I slid in beside her neither of us made any attempt to snuggle. 

The next day Jean begged off going to the amusement park with us claiming that she didn't feel well. The kids and I had a great time at the park and when we got home Jean wasn't there. She came in about an hour later with a couple of pizzas that she had picked up on her way home. 

"I just didn't feel like cooking tonight. I'm not feeling all that great so I'm going up to bed." 

The next five days slid by with Jean and I basically just existing in the same house. Neither one of us made any effort to talk to the other other than to say things like "What would you like for dinner" and "Don't forget to put the garbage out." On Friday when I had lunch with Alan he pushed a single CD across the table to me. 

"Nothing much. She visited him in the hospital on Saturday. I don't have any visual, but the audio from her purse bug shows she was crying when she left. They mostly talked about how they hadn't realized just how bitter Andy's wife would be and they wondered where she found the guys who did the damage. The good news, at least I think you will think that it is good, is that he told her that unless she can divorce you and get a big chunk of money they weren't going to be able to follow through on their plans. 

"It seems that Andy doesn't have health insurance of his own. He was covered under his wife's policy from where she works and she took him off her policy when she filed for divorce. He is on the hook for his medical bills and they are considerable and growing every day. There is some video of her sitting around the house crying, but other than that there isn't anything." 

"I guess they are shit out of luck then because she isn't going to be getting any 'big chunk of money' out of me. In fact tonight I'm going to tell her that the household budget is going to have to be cut by a third or she can give up her car. It will be her choice, but it will have to be one or the other. I've already told her that my pay has been cut by a third because of the bad economy and that more cuts may be coming." 

"How long are you going to keep it going?" 

"That's up to Jean. She can bail anytime she feels like it and there isn't anything I can do about it. The no-fault divorce laws in this state don't give me any leeway, but unless Jean jumps ship I intend to hang in there until the kids are old enough to go out on their own or are old enough to choose which parent they want to live with if a divorce does happen." 

"Well I've said it before and I'll say it again, good luck bud." 

When I got home I asked Jean if she'd talked to Pat and she said no. 

"Isn't that strange? I don't remember a day when the two of you didn't talk. She must be really bummed over what Andy did to her. I'll give her a call and see if I can't get her over here so we can cheer her up." 

"I don't think you should. Right now I think she needs to be left alone and don't forget I know her much better than you do." 

"Okay, if you say so. We have enough problems of our own right now. We are going to have to reduce the household budget by a third until things pick up at work."  

===

"I don't see how." 

"Well I'm going to let it be your choice, but it is either reduce household expenses or give up your car. The payment, plates and insurance are about the same as a third of the household budget. You decide what you want to do." 

"That's not fair. I need my car." 

"Then trim the budget. The bottom line is that we have a third less coming in that we used to have and we have to deal with it." 

"I don't se...." 

"God damn it Jean! It has to be done. Get used to the fact we will not be living high on the hog anymore. Just fucking do it and stop arguing about it and pray that things don't get worse. There is still a chance the company could fold and then we would really be in deep shit." 

I left her sitting there and went down in the basement to work on a few things. I went back upstairs an hour later and asked what was for dinner. 

"I was hoping that we could go out tonight." 

"Jesus Christ woman! Are you fucking brain dead? I just finished telling you that we are in financial trouble and need to trim the budget. Get the words in your head Jean. Budget, budget, budget!" 

She ran out of the room crying and I smiled and got busy fixing dinner. When it was ready I called the kids in from playing and as we ate we talked about their day at school. They asked where their mother was and I told them that mommy wasn't feeling well. 

"Something didn't agree with her so she is in the bedroom resting." 

After dinner I played with them until their bedtime and then I headed for the bedroom. Jean was awake when I came into the room and she looked up at me and said: 

"You didn't need to talk to me that way." 

"Yes I did. That go out for dinner garbage showed that you are not taking it seriously when I say we have less money coming in now and we have to adjust accordingly and that brings us back to the household budget or your car. Make your choice by Sunday night and let me know or Monday I'll make the choice." 

I slid under the covers, rolled over with my back to her and fell asleep with a smile on my face. There was no doubt in my mind she would chose budget over car, but I had a small hope that she wouldn't say anything to me by Sunday night and Monday I would get rid of her car. 

She was quiet at breakfast so the table talk was between me and the kids. I asked them what they wanted to do that day and when they didn't say anything I said: 

"How about we go to the park?" 

Jean, thinking by 'park' that I meant amusement park spoke up and said: 

"I thought we had to budget?" 

That gave me an opening to take another shot at her. 

"The park is free Jean. You don't have to pay to use the swings, slide or the jungle gym." 

I spent half a day at the park with the kids and then we went home and I did some yard work until dinner time. Dinner was a quiet affair. The kids were worn out and Jean apparently had nothing to say. After dinner I watched some TV until I felt ready for bed. Jean was already there and asleep or faking it which suited me just fine. 

Sunday morning I said I needed to go into the office and go over the books to see if there wasn't some way to cut our costs and stay competitive. An hour later I was buried in Kathy and she was crying out for me to do her harder and I sure tried. 

That night Jean gave me the answer that I was expecting. She would keep her car and work at trimming the budget. She was cool toward me and I guessed she wasn't over my calling her brain dead and I was okay with that. As long as she was cool toward me she wouldn't be trying to have sex and I wouldn't have to make excuses as to why I couldn't or didn't want to. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Monday morning I stopped at the bank and opened a new account in my name only. We had direct deposit at work for our paychecks and I moved the check deposit from our joint account to my new account and then made arrangements for an automatic transfer of two thirds of my check deposit to the joint account I held with Jean. 

That afternoon Kathy and I attended a meeting at the Hilton with representatives from Matheson Manufacturing and after the meeting we went upstairs and spent a very pleasant hour before going back to work. Just before quitting time I got a call from Alan. 

"I've got something that you need to hear right away. Can you stop by on the way home?" 

"I'm on my way. See you in ten." 

When I got to his shop he took me into his office and told me to have a seat. 

"What I have is all from her purse device. She visited him Saturday and yesterday, but their conversations were mostly him pushing her to get money and her telling him she couldn't because of your pay cut and you putting her on a budget. She saw him again today and the conversation moved onto a different plane. You aren't going to believe this." 

He pushed some buttons on his desk and from the speakers on the credenza behind him I heard: 

"We have another option. How much life insurance does he have?" 

"About a million. He has a five hundred thousand dollar policy that he pays into and another five hundred thousand dollar policy from work." 

"Any of them double indemnity?" 

"Both of them I think." 

"So an accidental death would get you two million?" 

"About that I'd guess." 

"So we need for him to have a fatal accident." 

"How do we do that?" 

"We will have to give it some thought, but I'm sure with both of us thinking on it we can come up with something." 

"I wouldn't even know where to begin." 

"Put your mind to it; something will occur to you. Maybe nothing workable, but maybe your idea will trigger something in my mind or maybe something you think of will work with something I think of." 

Alan switched it off and said, "I'll give you a copy so you can listen to the entire conversation later, but I felt that you needed to hear that part right away." 

I sat there silent for a bit and then said, "This changes things. The Russians used to have something the KGB called 'wet work' and right now I would dearly love to know someone who could do that kind of stuff." 

Alan looked at me for several seconds and then he picked up a pen and wrote something on a pad of paper and slid it across the desk to me. I read it and looked up at him in amazement and he stared back at me with no expression on his face. The pad said: 

"Twenty thousand each." 

I reached over and picked up the pen and scratched out the each and wrote "Andy." Then I slid the pad back to him and said "Go." He smiled and said, "Consider it done." 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was hard for me to act normal around Jean that night when I got home. Dinner was mostly me and the kids talking about their day. After dinner I helped them with their homework and then we watched their favorite DVD – The Lion King – and when it was over it was their bedtime. Jean was in bed waiting for me on top of the covers and she was naked except for a pair of super sexy high heels. There was a time when the sight would have had me tearing off my clothes and ravishing her, but I just looked at her, slowly undressed, got in bed and slid under the covers. I rolled onto my side with my back to her and closed my eyes. After about five minutes she got off the bed and a couple of minutes later she got back in bed, got under the covers and we fell asleep. 

I didn't sleep all that well and I got up early. I was dressed and gone before Jean woke up. I had breakfast at the IHOP and then headed into the office. Around ten I called Pat and asked her to meet me for lunch. Over taco salads I told her that I was going to tell Jean that I knew about her and Andy. 

"I know you don't care about her anymore, but I thought I should let you know." 

"You're right; I don't care, but what about you trying to keep your kids?" 

"I think I can keep them. Jean likes her lifestyle too much to walk away from it especially since Andy isn't going to be able to do much for her. She can stay and be the mommy, but it will mean separate bedrooms and pretending to be a loyal and loving wife in public. I think she will go along with it. I have a club I can use on her if she doesn't." 

"Oh? What is that?" 

"All the video and audio tapes I have of her and Andy. She plays my game or the world will get to see what kind of a whore she really is. How is your divorce coming?" 

"He isn't fighting it so it should be final in about three months." 

I wished her well and went back to work. I called Jean and told her that I had to work late and not to hold dinner for me and after work I took Kathy out to dinner and we ended up at her place for dessert. I got home at midnight and Jean was in bed asleep. Once again I was up and out of the house before Jean woke up. When I got home that night Jean was red eyed from crying and I found out why the next morning when Alan called me. 

"Just wanted to let you know that I heard that your wife's friend's husband died yesterday afternoon. The story I got was that someone, one of the nurses probably, didn't clear the air out of a needle when they changed one of his IV bottles. An air bubble reached his heart and it just stopped beating. Some people have all the bad luck. You might want to let your wife know so she can call her friend and offer support." 

"I'll do that. Thanks for letting me know." 

When I got home that night Jean was not in a good mood at all. I was a half an hour later getting home than usual and when I walked in she said: 

"Would it have killed you to call me and let me know that you'd be late?" 

The tone of her voice was just what I needed to set up what I was going to do. 

"Don't get snappish with me! I've about had it with you. After the kids go to bed you and I are going to sit down and have a little talk and get a few things straight." 

I walked away from her to wash up for dinner and left her standing there with a stunned look on her face. 

Ten minutes after putting the kids to bed I told her to meet me in the den. She was sitting on the leather couch when I walked in and I took the chair at the desk. 

"First off, I know why you and Pat aren't speaking and I know who Andy was fucking around on her with." 

I saw surprise and then anger wash over her face and I was pretty sure I read it right. 

"Pat didn't snitch you out. She said she wouldn't tell me if you talked Andy into not fighting the divorce, She didn't tell me; I told her" and as I said that I hit the play button on the VCR and Jean got her first look at the material I had been gathering. I let her watch a minutes worth and then I fast forwarded to the place where they talked about Pat's trust fund. 

"It was when I saw this that I told Pat about you and Andy and showed her this footage. Why I have been sitting on this and doing nothing about it is none of your business. All that matters is that I have now decided to act. You have three options and only three. 

The first is that you pack and leave and I'll go for a divorce with you getting nothing and me getting custody of the kids. 

"The second is that you can stay here and be a mother to the kids and a housekeeper for me. You will move all your things into the guest bedroom. As far as friends and family are concerned we will continue to appear as a loving couple, but there will be no, and I repeat – no – sexual contact between us. 

"The third option is that you can say "Fuck you Frank; I'm taking the kids and I'll fight to get everything out of you that I can." If you go that route I'll take this little snippet to the police" and I hit the play button again and she got to listen to herself discussing my upcoming accidental death with her lover. 

"That is called 'conspiracy to commit murder' and in this state it will get you up to twenty-five years in prison. While you are locked up I will divorce you, get custody of the kids and they will be grown up and out on their own before you ever see them again. Those are your choices and I want your answer before I leave for work in the morning. One last thing. Tomorrow you get your ass down to the hospital and tell Andy when he is released he had best catch the first plane, train or bus out of town because I'll be coming after him. If you care for him as much as it seems it may help you decide on either option one or two because option three puts him in the jail cell next to you." 

"I can't." 

"Can't what?" 

"Tell him. He died in the hospital." 

"When?" 

"Sometime late yesterday afternoon." 

That's too damned bad. I was looking forward to putting him back in the hospital when he got out. You know what upset me the most? Not you fucking Andy, although that did really piss me off, but what really was the pits for me was that when he proposed my death you didn't say "We can't do that" or "I won't be a party to anything like that." You just went along with it. Get out of here and move into the guest room and don't forget I want an answer by the time I leave for work in the morning." 

She got up and left and I ejected the CD from the player and put it in my briefcase which I took upstairs and into the bedroom with me. I wrestled the dresser over to block the door so that I wouldn't get a visit in the middle of the night while I was sleeping and then I went to bed and slept well. 

++++++++++++++++ 

In the morning I found Jean sitting red eyed in the kitchen. I poured myself a cup of coffee and then said: 

"Well?" 

"Well what?" 

"What's your answer?" 

"You already know and don't pretend that you don't. I can't give up my kids and I don't want to go to jail." 

"Okay. We will go over the details when I get home tonight. Don't hold dinner because I'll be working late. One thing to keep in mind. It should be obvious to you that I having you watched. The first time there is any indication, however slight, that you are planning on taking the kids and running I will drop the hammer on you. Understood?" 

"Yes." 

I had a great day at work and of course my 'working late' was a euphemism for spending time in Kathy's apartment. I got home around nine and found Jean watching TV. I just looked at her and said "kitchen" and walked into the den and put my briefcase down on my desk. When I got to the kitchen Jean was sitting at the table. I sat down opposite her and said: 

"The rules are simple. You will continue to be the mother that you have always been. You will maintain the house as you always have and you will act normal where I am concerned when the children are around. When we are out in public or with friends and family you will play the part of an attentive and loving wife. The excuse for our separate bedrooms will be that I snore so loud that you can't sleep. 

"As far as you having a sex life is concerned I'll leave that up to you, but you will never bring another man into this house. Whatever you do you will make sure that it does not become public and cause me humiliation. That shouldn't be a problem for you since you have had plenty of practice. You managed to keep me and Pat in the dark for over six years. You follow these rules and nothing will change for you. You will still have your credit cards, access to the checking account and you will still have your car. The only change in fact is that you will no longer have a loving husband, but that shouldn't matter because you didn't want him anyway. Any questions?" 

"Just one. How long?" 

"Until the kids are eighteen or set out on their own." 

"What then?" 

"Who knows? That is ten years away and a lot of things can change by then. You can also choose to take option one any time you decide you want to. I will even soften it some. I give you five grand for every year you stick it out and if you make it for at least five years I'll throw in a new car for you to drive away in." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

That was seven years ago and things have worked out well. To all observers Jean is a devoted wife and mother. She has had a series of boyfriends, but she has kept them all under the radar and I doubt that any of our friends and family know about it. Except for my parents of course. I told them all about her affair with Andy and I've told them about my current relationship with her, but I've never told them the story about how I got her to agree to the relationship. Her current boyfriend is serious enough about her to put a private detective on me, but how serious she is about him is something that I don't know and I'm not about to ask. 

Dad has announced that he is going to step down next year and turn the company over to me. When that happens I might make some changes. Maybe cut Jean loose and give her ample visitation. Another option, and one I'm leaning to, is that there is a house on five acres that has a guest cottage next to the four car garage. I could buy it, get a quiet divorce from Jean and let her live in the cottage so she would be close to the kids. I think Kathy might like that. She hasn't said anything, but I know she would like a more permanent relationship and for that matter so would I. 

Oh well, in a year we will see.  

===

Our story is like so many others. We met in college, dated off and on and then one day I realized I didn't want to date other girls. I wanted to spend all my time with Mary Beth. Apparently about the same time she decided that she wanted to spend her time with me. We were a steady couple the rest of the way through college and we were married three months after graduation. 

Mary Beth never did put her college education to go use. Three weeks after we married we found out that she was pregnant. She had Gloria and eleven months later she had Alexander. She decided that she would be a stay at home mom and I had no problem with that. One year after the arrival of Alex Melanie arrived on the scene and Mary Beth decided that three was enough and she had her tubes tied. 

We lived in the house that my parents left me in their wills. They met an untimely death when a deputy sheriff involved in a high speed chase lost control of his patrol car and hit them head on, 

The house was a hundred year old farm house on eight hundred acres. The house had been built by my great grandfather and had been passed down through the family. Each generation had added modern touches to the place so even thought the house appeared to be very old on the outside the interior was quite up to date. 

The property had a large barn and an equipment shed which was really a large six vehicle garage. There were also several other small out buildings like the milk shed that wasn't used as a milk shed any more and they were instead used for storing things. The place was free and clear thanks to a settlement from the County and my parent's life insurance. 

I never wanted to be a farmer like my great grandfather, my grandfather and my dad so I leased out the acreage to the Martins who were our neighbors to the south. The closest I came to farming or ranching was keeping horses. At one time we had five. Mine, Mary Beth's and each of the kids had one. When the kids left we sold off theirs, but still had the two that Mary Beth and I ride. 

We put all three kids through college and they are all married now and are away from home. Mary Beth has never had to work unless she wanted to and she never wanted to until the last kid left for college and then she decided that she wanted to go to work. She decided that she wanted to be a nurse and she went back to school to get a nursing degree. She worked as a nurse for a couple of years before finding out that she could not stand being around sick people all the time. 

Mary Beth has never wanted for anything. Clothes, jewelry, car, you name it and if she wanted it I got it for her. We had what I considered a good, solid relationship. We made love often and it was always exciting. She is a very beautiful woman and I have always showered her with compliments, attention, love and affection, 

All of which makes what happened so hard to understand. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was a Tuesday and after breakfast Mary Beth and I enjoyed a cup of coffee out on the patio and talked about what the day had in store for us. Mary Beth said that she was going to run into town and buy groceries and other than taking care of the horses she wasn't planning on doing anything else. All I had going was just another day at the office. 

I drove toward town and when I got to the railroad tracks about a mile south of town I found a stopped train blocking the crossing. I sat there for maybe fifteen minutes and then I got out of my pick up and headed up the track to see if I could find out what was going on. I found a guy checking a coupler between two boxcars and asked him what was going on. The train had hit a cow and they were waiting for the sheriff and he was apparently on the other end of the county. They couldn't move until he arrived. 

I got back in my truck and turned around and went back home. When I got home I went into the house and Mary Beth wasn't there. Her car was still there so I figured that she was down at the barn taking care of the horses. The barn is about two hundred yards from the house and I headed down to it. As I got closer to the barn I saw the tail end of a pick up truck. It looked like my friend Mike's truck and I wondered what he would be doing parked behind my barn at that time of day. I walked down behind the barn and checked and sure enough it was Mike's. 

The door to the tack room was right there so I opened the door and went in. As soon as I was in the tack room I heard the moans of a woman being fucked. I moved quietly to where I could see into the barn proper and what I saw ruined my day. Mary Beth was naked and lying on a horse blanket on top of some hay bales. Her legs were up on Mike's shoulders and he was pounding away at her. She was moaning and gasping out: 

"Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me." 

I could feel the heat building in me. A burning rage to get my deer rifle and shoot them both. I noticed a hay fork hanging on the wall and I smiled at the thought of driving it through Mike's back and pinning the two cheating shits together. I was reaching for the fork when I came to my senses and remembered what happened to Bill Miglio when he killed the guy he caught fucking his wife Mae. He got life without the possibility of parole. I didn't want that. I'd make Mike and Mary Beth pay, but I would plan it out in a way that wouldn't send me to prison. 

I turned and left the barn and as I came out the door I noticed the water hose that Mary Beth used to fill the horse's water tanks. On a whim I picked it up and stuck it in the filler tube of Mike's gas tank and turned the water on. I filled the tank, turned the water off. And then, cooled down a bit, I went back in the barn. 

Mary Beth was begging Mike to fuck her harder. He was banging her hard and I heard him tell her that he was going to cum. She grabbed his ass and pulled him deep into her and he grunted as he came. He pulled out of her and reached for his pants and Mary Beth said: 

"Aren't you forgetting something?" 

He dropped his pants, knelt in front of her and started eating her pussy and sucking his dick snot out of her. Mary Beth had an orgasm as he did it. They were kissing when I left, got in my truck and headed to work. The train was gone and I went into work and explained my absence and they told me that they already knew about the train and figured that was why I wasn't there. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

After work I headed home and on the way I passed a wrecker towing Mike's truck. I laughed and thought "That's only the beginning asshole -- only the beginning." The rest of the drive home was spent thinking about what to do to Mary Beth. She had to pay. I wouldn't be able to rest unless I made her pay. 

As I pulled up at the house I steeled myself to act normal around the cheating whore. Over dinner I asked Mary Beth if she had talked to Alice (Mike's wife) lately. 

"Why?" 

"Why what?" 

"Why would you ask that?" 

"Just curious. We used to have her and Mike over quite often and I haven't seen her in a while. I just wondered if something was wrong. Anything come between the two of you that I don't know about?" 

I saw something pass over her face as she said, "No. As a matter of fact I talked to her this afternoon. She told me that someone had damaged Mike's truck by putting water in his gas tank." 

"Maybe he got caught fucking some one's wife." 

Mary Beth got a funny look on her face and I went on, "Rumor has it that Mike is fucking some slut and has caught an STD. I sure hope that whoever he is fucking is making him use a rubber." 

At that point Mary Beth turned pale and I left the kitchen. I laughed to myself and headed down to the equipment shed to work on a thirty year old John Deere that I was restoring. 

I worked for a couple of hours and then went back to the house. Mary Beth was in the living room and I could hear her talking on the phone so I moved quietly to where I could listen in. 

"Are you absolutely certain? Damn it Mike; if you have anything then you gave it to me and I'll end up giving it to Ralph. Once that happens he will know and God help us then." 

"And how did the rumors start? Are you bragging about doing me?" 

"No, I don't want to stop, but I do want to be safe." 

"Okay. Same time?" 

"See you then." 

I walked into the room just as she was hanging up. 

"That was Alice. Mike's truck has been fixed. I asked if they would like to come over for a barbecue on Saturday. She said she would check with Mike. Is that okay with you?" 

"Fine" I said and went into the kitchen to get a beer. I drank my beer and thought about Mary Beth. She was going to be put on the street very soon, but I wanted some measure of revenge first. And Mike had to suffer also. Shit! If Mary Beth wanted to fuck around maybe she should have asked me first. I might have agreed to let her. I'd never been unfaithful, but there was this little sexpot where I worked that I could have easily talked myself into trying. I might have said yes if Mary Beth would have asked just so I wouldn't feel guilty going after Amber. 

After the phone call Mary Beth seemed to be a little out of sorts. She acted very sweet around me and even came up to me and rubbed my dick through my pants and asked me if it gave me any ideas. It did and as we headed for the bedroom I wondered if she had cleaned herself after Mike left or if maybe I was going to get sloppy seconds. 

Our sexual episodes usually included me eating her pussy, but no way was I going to munch on her muffin not knowing whether or not she cleaned up after Mike. I wondered if the fact that I didn't eat her made her wonder why. I fucked her and she was as active a participant as usual and after the first time she did go down on me and get me up for a second go. 

She woke me up in the morning with a state of the art blow job and then rode me cowgirl until we both got off, I thought we were done, but she climbed in the shower with me and I took her as she leaned against the wall. We ended up back in bed for one more round and then she jumped up and ran to fix me breakfast while I dressed for work. 

On the drive into town I wondered if she would clean herself before her meeting with Mike that morning or if she would give him sloppy seconds and then make him suck the both of us out of her snatch. 

At work I flirted a bit with Amber. With any luck at all I could have her interested by the time I kicked Mary Beth to the curb. 

++++++++++++++++ 

Late that afternoon Mary Beth called me and asked me if we could go out that night for dinner and a couple of drinks. I figured why not? If I kept her happy with any luck I would get enough pussy before I tossed her out to last me until I could find another source. 

Usually when we go to town Alice and Mike join us. Mary Beth said that she thought it would be nice for a change for it to be just the two of us. When we walked into Dusty's and headed for our usual table we found Alice and Mike all ready sitting there. I saw the looks exchanged between Mary Beth and Mike and I just smiled and acted like the clueless twit they thought that I was. 

We joined them and sat and talked until the band got set up and started playing. I noticed that Mike was drinking more than usual and I wondered if he was feeling guilty having to sit there and look at me. I also noticed the looks being exchanged by Mary Beth and Mike. Bob and Merrie Hopkins joined us and that eased the tension just a tad. 

There was a nice slow tune being played and Alice tried to get Mike to dance with her, but Mike said that he didn't feel like dancing. Mary Beth suggested that I dance with Alice so I stood up and escorted her out onto the floor. I figured that suggesting I dance with Alice was Mary Beth's way to get Alice and me out of the way so she could talk to Mike. I guess I was right because in a minute I saw the two of them on the other side of the floor. 

I wondered just how clueless Mike and Mary Beth thought I was. Over the next two hours Mary Beth danced with Mike about twice to every time she danced with me. I didn't care because I knew something that the both of them didn't and that was that two of them were going to pay a price for their actions and it would be sooner rather than later. 

Besides, dancing with Alice wasn't a chore. Her tits were bigger than Mary Beth's and on the slow tunes I held her close and those puppies pushed into my chest. When Mary Beth and Mike were history I thought I just might pay Alice some attention. 

Mary Beth wanted to leave about half an hour before last call so I hit the bathroom to take a whiz before the drive home. Mike was in the john, more than a little drunk, and he was running off at the mouth to a couple of other guys. I did my thing and then left. 

As we were driving home I told Mary Beth that Mike was in the bathroom and he was bitching to Maury Phillips that there was a woman there that he wanted to take out to the parking lot and fuck, but her husband and Alice were there so he couldn't. 

"I jokingly asked him if he would share if I could distract the husband and Alice. He just laughed and said that the woman was a whore and I wouldn't like her loose cunt." 

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a change come over Mary Beth's face as she considered what her lover might be saying about her when he was drunk. Hopefully I was on the way to poisoning the well. 

Once we were home Mart Beth changed into one of her sexy gowns and came into the den where I was checking my email. Her nipples were hard and sticking out and I wondered what a drunken Mike had managed to do to get her hot. She spun around in front of me and asked me if the gown gave me any ideas. 

"Silly girl. Of course it gives me ideas. We need to take this to the bedroom." 

I started sucking her tits (and I admit I was thinking of Alice's) and then I worked my way down her body until I got to her snatch. She was moaning and she had her legs spread wide. She was very wet and if I hadn't kept a close eye on her all night I would have suspected that the wetness was Mike's leavings. I wondered what Mike had done to get her so wet. It pissed me off and then I looked up at her and asked if she was all right. 

"Why would you ask that now?" 

"Your pussy smells bad and it looks all reddish." 

She jumped out of bed and hurried to the bathroom. I watched as she put her fingers in her pussy and then smelled them. She pulled her pussy lips apart and looked at them. She told me that it was my imagination, but she would make a doctor's appointment and get herself checked out. She came back to bed, but her mood had changed and she didn't want to make love anymore. I told her that it wasn't fair that she get me all hard and stiff and then say no. 

"It's all your fault. You're the one who said there was something wrong with my pussy." 

"Maybe. But there is nothing wrong with your ass" I said as I rolled her over." 

"I don't want to do that." 

"And I do" I said as I started to work my cock into her ass. 

She tried to get away, but I held onto her and kept working my cock until I was all the way in. Once I got to stroking she couldn't help but get into it. 

I knew when it was over she would be pissed and things might be a little frosty around the house for a day or two, but I didn't really give a shit. Her days were numbered; she just didn't know it. 

++++++++++++++++ 

I talked with a lawyer on Wednesday and he told me that I would need irrefutable proof if I was going to divorce Mary Beth for adultery. We were a no-fault state, but the local judges were known to take a hard line against the adulterous party. 

Thursday as I got ready to go to work Mary Beth reminded me that she was going to go visit her cousin and might be late in getting home. I told her that I remembered. 

I had arranged a day trade with one of the other guys and so when I left the house to go to work I drove around to the back of the property and parked so a clump of trees was between me and the house. I made my way to the barn and entered the tack room. There is a ladder from the tack room up to the hayloft and I got up into the hayloft and positioned myself where I could see the house and get a good view of the action in the barn and not be seen. 

It was a long wait and I began to wonder if I'd miscalculated then around eleven I saw Mary Beth heading for the barn. I always come down early and let the horses out of the barn and into the corral. When Mary Beth comes down they go to her because they know she is going to feed them. She gave them some oats and then mucked out their stalls. Once that was done she arranged four bales of hay, spread a horse blanket over them and started to undress. As she was pulling off her boots I heard a truck pull up behind the barn. 

I turned on the video camera and waited. Mike came into the barn and walked over to Mary Beth, took her in his arms and kissed her. They swapped tongues for a minute or so and then pulled apart and started undressing. When both were naked Mary Beth turned and bent forward over the hay bales and Mike moved up and took her from behind. I hate to admit it, but my dick got hard watching the two of them. 

They went at it for about ten minutes and then Mike pulled out of her. He was limp so I know he came in her. She turned and went to her knees and took him in her mouth and started sucking on him. It took her about five minutes to get him back up again and then she laid back on the bales, spread her legs wide and waited for Mike to move into her. He fucked her hard and steady for about fifteen minutes as she wrapped her legs around him and clutched his ass with her hands. 

Finally he stopped and held still for a bit and then when he pulled out his cock was limp. Mary Beth said something and pointed at her cunt. Mike knelt and started sucking up his mess. Once he had her cleaned out to her satisfaction she started sucking on him to get him up for another go. I had enough evidence so I turned off the camera and then quietly climbed back down into the tack room. As I slipped out of the tack room I noticed the water hose and I just could not resist. It might make him wonder about his truck not running right following his visits to Mary Beth, but so the fuck what? Let him wonder if I was onto him. Let him start looking over his shoulder. 

I drove into town had a few beers to kill time and then I went home arriving at my usual time. I fixed myself a bite to eat and sat down to watch some TV. Mary Beth came home around eight and told me that she was horny and said that she wanted to go to bed early. I almost told her I wasn't feeling good and really wasn't up to it, but then I decided that once I tossed her out it might be a while before I got laid again. Once again I skipped doing oral on her and after sucking on her tits and fingering her pussy for a bit I got right to it. After a pretty active fuck I came and was surprised when Mary Beth went immediately down on me to get me up again. I guess fucking Mike kind of charged her up. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Friday on the way to work I dropped off the video tape at the attorney's and made the necessary plans for ruining Mary Beth's day on Sunday morning. When I got home Mary Beth was all hot to trot again and I wondered if Mike had been by again. I wondered when the boy worked. Whatever. I gave Mary Beth what she wanted and then we had a late supper and watched some TV. When we got to bed she wanted to go again and I didn't fight her off. 

I had to work every third Saturday and it was my Saturday to work. As I got ready to leave for work Mary Beth reminded me that we were going out with Mike and Alice that evening and they would be there at six-thirty to pick us up. I told her I remembered and then left the house. 

Mary Beth was dressed and ready to go out when I got home. Even as pissed at her as I was I had to admit that she was one beautiful and sexy lady. I wanted her right then and there, but decided that it wouldn't be right to make love to her and then kick her out.  

===

Mike and Alice showed up just after I had showered and changed. Mary Beth was hustling around trying to get us out of the house, but I told her to slow down. I told them that I needed them to come into the den so I could show them a funny video that I had gotten earlier in the day. 

They came into the den and I told Mary Beth to hit the 'play' button on the VCR. The video was very clear and Mary Beth got very red in the face. Mike paled and Alice was stunned. I just stood there and watched. Alice recovered first and she hollered "You rotten son of a bitch" and kneed Mike in the balls and then said: 

"You aren't riding in the car with me. You can walk home for all I care and don't be surprised if when you get there the doors are all locked." 

She stormed out of the house and I took Mike by the shirt collar, pulled him to the front door and pushed him outside. Mary Beth had followed me and when I closed the door she said: 

"I guess we need to talk. We can do it in the living room." 

I sat in the easy chair across from Mary Beth who was sitting on the couch and I told her: 

"I'm going for a divorce using adultery as grounds and I want you out of the house. You have until Monday to gather up your stuff and leave." 

"I'm not going anywhere. Do you really want to divorce me?" 

"Absolutely." 

"You going to tell me that you don't love me?" 

"No. I can't tell you that. I love you, but I can no longer live with you. Not after seeing what you did with Mike." 

"Well I love you and you are stuck with me." 

She uncrossed her legs, opened them wide to show me that she didn't have any panties on. She stuck a finger in her pussy and then licked it. 

"Only a fool would give this up" she said as she stood up. "I'll be up in the bedroom waiting for you." 

She walked over to the stairs, stopped and turned around and looked at me. She blew me a kiss and went up the stairs. 

She was going to have a long wait. I slept on the couch and made my plans for moving her things out of the house and once all of her stuff was out she would be gone even if I had to pick her up and carry her out. As I nodded off I was thinking of Amber and wondering what an acceptable waiting period should be. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

In the morning I was in the kitchen making the coffee when Mary Beth came into the kitchen. 

"You didn't come to bed last night." 

"Slept on the couch." 

"You aren't really going to divorce me over my having some recreational sex are you?" 

"Of course I am." 

"You aren't really thinking to clearly honey. This is a no-fault state and you know as well as I do that in a divorce I will get half of everything we have." 

"We don't have anything Mary Beth. Everything we had in savings paid for the kid's college education. You will get your car, your clothes, half of the household goods and your horse. And if you look into it you will find that the three judges in this county have never, not once, given alimony to a cheating wife." 

"You will have to sell the farm and given me half." 

"I know your memory sucks Mary Beth. You forgot your wedding vows and you also apparently forgot the prenuptial agreement that you signed when we got married. It exempts the family farm from any and all legal actions that you might bring against it. You need to start figuring out where you are going to live Mary Beth because after that man, and I pointed out the window at the car that was coming up the drive, gets done you will be out of here." 

"You bastard! You won't get away with this. I'll get a shark for an attorney and we will break that pre-nup." 

"You are welcome to waste all the money you don't have on an attorney if you want to, but I'll tell you right now it won't do you any good." 

"We will just have to see about that." 

The doorbell rang and I went to answer it. I opened the door to Bill Neubert and said good morning to him. He walked over to Mary Beth, handed her an envelope and said: 

"Sorry about this Mary Beth, but you have been served." 

He turned and left and I said, "Want me to help you load your stuff in your car?" 

"Fuck you Ralph! This isn't over. Not by a long shot." 

"I'll take that as a no" I said and I walked away from her. 

Mary Beth loaded her clothes in her car as I watched from the living room window. When she got in the car to leave she gave me the old one finger salute and then backed down the drive, 

She hadn't been gone forty-five minutes when I received a visit from Mike's wife Alice. She wanted to know if she could get a copy of the tape I had of Mike and Mary Beth playing in the barn, 

"I was going to try and work by it, but ten minutes ago Mary Beth called and he left to go meet her somewhere. I'm done with him." 

"Come on in and have a cup of coffee while I make you a copy." 

She came in and sat down and I poured her a cup. While she waited I went into the den and used my double VCR setup to make her a copy. When I gave it to her she asked me what I was going to do. 

"All ready done it. I had her served and tossed her out of the house a little before you got here." 

"No hope?" 

"Nary a tad." 

After Alice left I poured myself another cup of coffee and sat down to do the next disagreeable task. I needed to call the kids and let them know what was going on. Better that they got it from me than Mary Beth. I was almost positive that if I left it for her to do she would somehow make me the bad guy. 

I managed to get in touch with Gloria and Melanie, but I had to leave a message to call me on Alex's answering machine. Once I had the calls out of the way I called Ryan at Acadia Locks and arranged for him to come out and change all the locks on the house. I didn't trust Mary Beth not to make visits to the house while I was at work and take whatever she wanted. 

I'd done the bank and credit card thing the previous day knowing when Mary Beth was going to be served. I wasn't totally heartless. I'd left a thousand dollars in the checking account for her, but it wasn't going to last her long. 

I went around the house and gathered up everything that was Mary Beth's and put it in boxes and bags and then moved it all down to the barn. By the time I'd finished that Alex had called and I gave him the run down on what was going on. He took it better than the girls had. They wanted to know why I wouldn't try to work things out so I could stay married to their mother, but Alex had been cheated on by a couple of girlfriends and he had an idea of how I was feeling. 

After talking to Alex I went through the kitchen and made a list of what I needed from the store since I would be cooking for myself from then on and I usually ate differently when I cooked than when Mary Beth cooked. 

Having nothing better to do I drove into town and did some grocery shopping. When I got back home Mike's truck was sitting beside the house and Mary Beth was trying to get in the front door. I got out of my pickup and walked up to the front porch. 

"What are you doing here Mary Beth? You don't live here anymore." 

"I came to get the rest of my things, but I can't get in the house." 

"That's because I changed the locks to keep you out. The rest of your stuff is in bags and boxes down in the barn. And you need to move your horse. If she is still here a week from tomorrow I'll be charging you boarding fees. Now I would suggest that you get in shitheads truck, drive down to the barn, get your junk and then get off my property. And Mary Beth? Stay off." 

I walked towards Mike's truck and when he saw me coming he rolled up his window and locked his door. I had to smile at that. I leaned down and said, loud enough for him to hear through the glass: 

"Keep this truck off my property shit for brains. If you need to bring Mary Beth out here for some reason or other park out on the road." 

Then I gave him a big smile and said, "The water hose won't reach that far." 

I laughed when I saw the realization hit him and the anger wash over his face. I had to wonder about the boy's smarts. I mean how could he have not figured it out? His truck runs fine when he drives over here. He fucks Mary Beth and leaves and his truck stops running. He gets it fixed and he drives over her with no problem and fucks Mary Beth and when he leaves his truck stops running. Duh!!! 

+++++++++++++++++ 

The next day at work I stopped in at the office and told Amber that I needed to change some of my paperwork. I dropped Mary Beth from my medical insurance and I changed the beneficiary on my company furnished life insurance from Mary Beth to the kids. Amber asked why and I told her that I was divorcing Mary Beth. 

"You all ready separated?" 

"Yep." 

"I could use a partner for the dance at the VFW this Friday." 

"Then I'm applying for the job." 

"You really going to look at it as work?" 

"It is something that I will definitely work hard at. I'm going to want to do a good enough job that you will want to do it with me again." 

She smiled and said that she would look forward to it and I left her office in a pretty good mood. 

I spent my lunch hour having fun. I'd spent some time the previous night making video captures from the tape I had of Mary Beth and Mike and I toured the town and paid a visit to every gas station and restaurant bathroom. I even paid a visit to both the men and women's bathrooms at the Wal-Mart. I taped a picture of Mary Beth with Mike buried in her ass on every empty stall I could find. On the picture I had printed "For a good time call Mary Beth at 555-555-5550" which was her cell number. Underneath that message I put "If you keep getting a busy signal call Mike at 555-555-4441 to schedule an appointment." Then, thoroughly pleased with myself I went back to work. 

I hadn't been back in the office fifteen minutes when I got a call from Mary Beth. 

"God damn you Ralph!! What the fuck is wrong with you?!!! So I wanted to try another dick after twenty-four years. So what? It didn't mean a goddamned thing. It was only some recreational sex for Christ's sake. It didn't cost you a fucking thing. You still got all you could handle. Hell; you got more. Mike got some pussy, but you got the love. How could you do this disgusting thing to me? I thought you loved me." 

"Once upon a time Mary Beth; once upon a time. Have fun with your new freedom. Bye" and I hung up on her. 

I was sitting there with a big smile on my face when Amber came into my office. 

"That smile for me?" 

"You betcha! Just thinking about our Friday night." 

We made small talk for a couple of minutes and then she gave me some paperwork to sign after which we had to get back to work. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

After work I stopped at the Drop Inn for a brew or two before going home to fix myself some dinner. I was on my second longneck when what I hoped would eventually happen happened. 

Mike came in, saw me, and then headed straight for me. 

"You rotten son of a bitch" he snarled and then he swung on me. I didn't try to block the punch. I steeled myself to take the hit and then I shook it off and beat the holy fuck out of Mike. He was on the floor and I had kicked him half a dozen times before some guys pulled me off of him. Probably a good thing because the way I was going I might have killed the asshole. 

Phil, the owner and evening bartender asked, "What the fuck got into you Ralph? You guys have been best friends forever." 

"I caught him fucking Mary Beth and he's pissed because I told his wife and let her see the pictures I took. Can you believe it? He fucks my wife and I'm the son of a bitch? It is his own fucking fault he is laying there on the floor. He came in here, attacked me and I defended myself. You saw it Phil. I was sitting there drinking my beer and minding my own business when he came up to me and hit me." 

"Yeah. I did see that." 

"Anyway; it's just his bad luck that I'm still full of anger over what he did and it kind of fueled my rage when I fought back." 

"He really fucked Mary Beth?" 

"Been in your bathrooms lately?" 

"No. I clean them before I open, but I use the private one in the back of my office." 

"Check out the stalls in the public restrooms." 

I tossed a ten on the bar and left. Mike was still lying on the floor moaning when the door closed behind me. He wouldn't be doing Mary Beth any good for a while because I'd kicked him in the nuts a time or three. Needless to say I was smiling when I drove home. 

Mike ended up in the ER at County General following 'our meeting' and I later heard that he was blaming Mary Beth for the loss of one of his testicles. 

Alice tossed his ass out and used the copy of the tape I gave her to sue him for divorce using adultery as grounds. 

I was feeling pretty proud of myself. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

I had a great time with Amber at the VFW dance and when I was taking her home she said: 

"You do know that the only reason I haven't been chasing you is that you were a married man right?" 

"No, I didn't know that. I do know that there have been times I've looked at you and wished that I wasn't married." 

"Then let me ask you this. Is this separation a permanent thing or are you just going through a mad spell and will make up with Mary Beth later?" 

"Not going to be any reconciliation. We are through and you can take that to the bank." 

"Then maybe you can have dinner with me at my place tomorrow?" 

"I'll bring the wine and the dessert." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

News travels fast in small towns and at two on Saturday afternoon I got a call from Mary Beth. 

"I see that it didn't take long for you to replace me." 

"You haven't been replaced yet Mary Beth." 

"I hear that you were out with that slut Amber last night." 

"That's a laugh. A slut like you calling Amber a slut." 

"I am not a slut." 

"Can't prove it by me. Not after watching you and Mike go at it in the barn." 

"It was only the one time Ralph. I swear it meant nothing. It was just me being curious about what another man would be like. That's all it was." 

"You are a poor liar Mary Beth. It wasn't only once. I saw it twice myself and I know that there were other times because I listened to you talk about it while you were in the barn with him. Why are you calling Mary Beth? What do you want?" 

"You to stop this divorce nonsense so we can get back together." 

"Not going to happen Mary Beth." 

"Why? Because you are fucking Amber now?" 

"I am not fucking Amber; at least not yet. I'm not going to do anything that will give you grounds to counter sue, but make no mistake about it Mary Beth; I fully intend to try and take Amber to bed as soon as I'm legally rid of you." 

"That will be never Ralph. I'm going to fight the divorce." 

"Good luck on that Mary Beth" and I hung up on her. 

I had a delightful evening with Amber and a kiss goodbye when I left that curled my toes. I was looking forward to a sexual relationship with Amber, but I was serious when I told Mary Beth that I wasn't going to do anything that would give her grounds to counter my suit against her for adultery. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next two weeks went by and during that time period several things happened. I dated Amber several times, received four very nasty calls from Mary Beth over calls she had received asking her for a good time and one call from her telling me that she'd found an attorney to take her case. 

"He know you have no money to pay him?" 

"He wasn't worried. He says in cases like mine the court will no doubt rule that you will have to pay my legal expenses or I can pay him out of my settlement." 

"If he told you that he sure isn't much of an attorney. Your settlement isn't going to be enough to get you into an apartment let alone pay attorney's fees." 

"Bullshit Ralph. The farm is free and clear and at $1600 an acre the acreage alone is worth $1,200,00.00 and you will have to give me half the value of that." 

"In your dreams Mary Beth. You keep forgetting the pre-nup." 

"My attorney says he can get that overturned." 

"This guy just out of law school? You don't have a prayer Mary Beth" and I hung up on her. 

It was two weeks later when she and her attorney met with me and mine and the hidden landmine went off under her feet. That is when she found out that the farm didn't belong to me. It belonged to our kids. 

I had learned some hard lessons from all the legal hoops I'd had to jump through to get the property after my parents had died and I had no intension of having that happen to my survivors if I died suddenly like my parents had. I'd formed a limited liability corporation and placed the farm in it. The corporation had four officers and three shareholders. I and the tree kids were the officers and the three kids were the shareholders. 

I had sat down with the kids when the youngest turned fifteen and talked it over with them. I explained why I had excluded their mother and they understood my reasoning and agreed not to mention what we were doing to Mary Beth. My reasoning was that the intent from when great grandfather first started the farm was that it stay in the family. That was reinforced by great grandfather passing it on to my grandfather who passed it on to my father who had passed it to me in his will. If I died an untimely death Mary Beth would inherit and possibly still be young enough to remarry and at that point the farm could conceivably go out of the family. What I was doing was insuring that the farm stayed in the family. The decision to keep Mary Beth out of it was to keep peace in the family. She might have understood, but then again she might not have so why take the chance of having a frosty household. 

There were all sorts of other legal documents put in effect at the same time like the one that said none of the share holders could sell his or her shares to anyone outside the family and that there be a provision in all their wills that would see to it that their shares stayed in the family. To be honest I didn't know if any of it would hold up after I died, but if I was dead I'd be out of it. 

But the big thing that day in my lawyer's conference room was that Mary Beth and her attorney now knew that they were out of it also. Mary Beth actually fainted when she found that out. 

When she was revived my attorney gave Mary Beth and "The shark" (her words, not mine) she had hired the rest of the bad news. 

"Since the assets are pretty cut and dried I was able to fast track things. I've got us on the docket for the Tuesday after next for the preliminary hearing. We drew Judge Hienman." 

If Mary Beth's attorney knew anything he would know that Hienman was the equivalent of a 'hanging judge' when it came to divorces where adultery played a part. If the offending party was a man he got raped to the extent that the law allowed in a no-fault state. If the guilty party was the woman she got the absolute least that Hienman could give. If kids were involved he had been known to give custody to the father and he would use any technicality he could find to give the woman no alimony. I was sure that Mary Beth's attorney knew that barring a miracle he was screwed as far as getting his fee from me was concerned. 

I left my attorney's office and went back to work where I asked Amber if she wanted to celebrate with me after work and she said that she would love to. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The nine days until the preliminary hearing went by quickly. I received four calls from Mary Beth asking (more like begging) me to drop the divorce and work with her at putting us back together. During the fourth call I asked her if she could give me one good reason why I should do that and she said: 

"Because you know that I love you Ralph." 

"Not enough to keep Mike out of your pussy." 

"It was a fling Ralph. It meant nothing. I was a virgin when I met you. I got curious and after twenty-four years of only you I wanted to see what another man would be like. I just wanted to try some strange. It was only a fling and it was all ready on its last legs when you found out. He was starting to get possessive and I was going to end it.  

===

"Damn it Ralph; I love you. I always have and I've done my absolute best for twenty-four years to prove it to you. I know you loved me and I know that you can't just turn love off like a light switch. Don't let a silly little fling kill off twenty-four damned good years. 

"Go and have a fling of your own. You said you intend to bed Amber so go do it. Call Alice and see if she wants to get even with Mike by fucking your socks off. We were good together Ralph. Please don't let it end." 

"We might could have done it if you would have brought up the curiosity thing before you spread for Mike, but you didn't do that did you. It might have been just a fling for you Mary Beth, but for me it was out and out cheating. It was stabbing me in the back. And with a man who was supposed to be my friend. I don't see a way back for us Mary Beth. I'm sorry, but I just don't. Take care Mary Beth" and I hung up on her. 

As I hung up on her I did wonder if I was doing the right thing. The twenty- four tears had been great right up to the day I saw what she was doing in the barn. I had to admit that the pull was there. Mary Beth was a known quantity while Amber was still a mystery to me. I still hadn't come to understand how a twenty-four year old hottie could be interested in a forty-four year old man. I was certainly attracted to her sexually, but could there be more to the relationship? I didn't know, but I did want to find out and to do that I needed to be divorced; I needed to be single again. Old fashioned of me maybe, but I'd made some vows and I had always been a man of my word. Mary Beth's phone call did plant a seed in the back of my mind. Would Alice be open for some 'get even' playing? Then there was Martha Rich. She lost Henry to cancer a little over two years ago so she might be ready to start dating again. 

+++++++++++++++ 

The preliminary hearing was cut and dried. A fifty-fifty split with the farm excluded. There was no alimony awarded. The judge commented on the fact that Mary Beth was a Registered Nurse and that not only was County General looking for nurses but so was Centura Hospital. Centura was thirty miles away in Overton, but a thirty mile commute was not an onerous thing. 

Mary Beth's attorney pushed for court ordered counseling and the judge asked me how I felt about that. 

"It would be a waste of time and money. She cheated on me and talking about it for an hour a week wouldn't make it go away. Talking about might help her come to grips with why she did it, but it wouldn't do a thing toward making me believe that she would never do it again. In fact, it would be a weekly reminder of something that I'm trying to forget." 

"I can see your point." 

He dropped his little wooden hammer to end the proceeding and the divorce would be final in six months. Mary Beth was crying as I left the courtroom and I felt a sudden urge to put my arms around her and comfort her. It was an urge that I successfully fought off. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

That hammer pounding on the desk freed me as far as I was concerned. It released me (in my mind anyway) from my vows and I called Amber and asked if she would like to celebrate with me that evening and she said that she would like to. 

We had a good date and when I took her home we did some pretty hot necking, but when I tried to escalate things she shot me down. 

"All that happened today Ralph is that now you are legally separated. You will still be married until the divorce is final. I want you Ralph, but I won't mess around with a married man." 

Well that sure enough brought me up short and it changed the way I was looking at things. I'd gone without for two months and I couldn't see me going without for another six. 

I was in the Safeway doing some grocery shopping and I ran into Alice. She said that she had heard about my hearing and then she asked me how I felt. 

"Alone. Something that I'm not used to." 

"I know the feeling. Seventeen years joined at the hip and suddenly I'm by myself." 

"You doing anything tonight?" 

"Other than watching TV? No; not really." 

"Would you like to have dinner with me? The Roadhouse and then maybe a few drinks and some two-stepping at the Barnyard?" 

"I'd love to Ralph. What time?" 

"How about I pick you up at six-thirty?" 

"I'll be ready." 

Apparently Alice had always known of my fascination with her tits because the blouse she was wearing showed enough cleavage to get lost in. She was also wearing a short skirt and four inch 'come fuck me' heels. She was dressed to entice and I most definitely was enticed. I had instant hope for a successful evening. 

We managed to avoid any direct mention of Mike and Mary Beth over dinner, but they were always in the background as we talked about what we were doing lately. Alice was a CPA and she had buried herself in her work and her life was pretty much get up, go to work, stay late and then come home and drop into bed. 

We finished our dinner and then drove over to the Barnyard for some drinks and dancing. We danced and on the slow ones she pressed her chest into mine and the feel of those puppies and the sight of all that cleavage when I glanced down had predictable results and I know she felt it from time to time as her leg came into contact with it. 

After a few drinks Alice opened up and I got the full story. After she kicked Mike out and filed for divorce she dated a lot to try and cheer herself up. The problem was that every guy who asked her out expected pussy at the end of the evening. 

"They thought that since I had been getting it steady when married I'd miss getting it and would need it. After a dozen or so dates I said to hell with it and stopped going out." 

"Would I be out of line in asking why you said yes to me?" 

"Promise you won't laugh?" 

"Promise." 

"I said yes to you for the same reason that all my dates asked me out. You were married and used to getting it steady and I thought you would miss getting it and needed it. Add to that my dates were right. I did miss it and need it. I just wasn't going to let myself get a reputation. Besides that I've wanted to do something to get back at Mike and what better way than to fuck the socks off of the man whose wife he cheated with." 

"You are an evil woman. You let me spend all this money buying dinner and drinks when you could have opened the door when I got there and said: 

"Good! You're here. Let's go to the bedroom." 

"I just finished telling you that I didn't want to get a reputation as an easy piece." 

"But think of the time we wasted. We could have done it four or five times by now." 

"Four or five times? The best Mike ever did was two. I guess we better leave so we can get started." 

"Oh no you don't. You set this evening in motion and I have no intention of ending it until I've danced the heels off of your sexy shoes." 

"Sexy shoes? Are you one of those guys who likes heels on the woman when you're in bed?" 

"Bet your bippy I am." 

"Oooh. I can't wait." 

I really didn't want to either, but I forced myself to go one more drink and three more dances before I suggested we leave. In the car I asked: 

"Your place or mine?" 

"Mine. I want Mike to know that you did me on what was once his bed." 

As I pulled into her drive I asked, "Are you sure about this? No chance at all of you reconciling with Mike?" 

"Not a prayer of a chance. Mary Beth wasn't his first. She is just the first that I'm not going to overlook or forgive him for." 

"Why would you overlook and forgive him for others, but not this one?" 

"The others I just knew about. I had no visual reference for any of the others, but Mary Beth came with pictures and sound." 

"How about you and Mary Beth? Any chance there at all?" 

"I learned a long time ago to never say never, but it isn't very likely." 

"Not likely, but possible?" 

I shrugged my shoulders. 

"Doesn't matter to me baby so come on in and let us get to it." 

The "It" we got to wasn't all that great. The product was all sexy packaging if you know what I mean. Sex with Alice was more like masturbation or doing it with a blow up doll. Actually a blow up sex doll would have been more responsive than Alice was. Alice just laid there. It was obvious that she enjoyed it and that she got off. She made all the sounds that indicated that she was into it, but the body didn't make what I considered appropriate responses. 

Her orgasm was vocal and loud, but the body didn't move. I could almost understand why Mike looked for other outlets. Make no mistake here. Alice liked what we did. She liked it enough than when I pulled my limp cock out of her she immediately went down on me and went to work on getting me back up. There was nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong, with Alice's blow jobs. The girl had talent in that area. 

She got me back up in no time and then laid back to play blow up sex doll again. The "Fuck me" and "Harder, harder" were there, but the body still gave no response. I tried sucking her tits. Nothing. I kissed her and sent my tongue down her throat while I squeezed her nipples. Nothing. I got vocal responses like "Oh yes" and "So good, so good" but the body remained inert. 

I pushed my second load into her and as I was pulling my softening cock out of her I was thinking of my exit strategy; how to say good night and get out gracefully. Before I could make a move though she was back down and sucking my cock. I will give her this. She might have been an uninspiring lay, but she was a world class cocksucker and she had me back up in no time. 

Once I was up she flopped down on her back and laid there waiting. I didn't want to. God knows if was the first time in my life I looked down on a naked woman waiting to be fucked and I didn't want to do it. But pride and ego made me push my cock into her a third time. A combination of my earlier saying four or five times and her telling me that Mike never went more than twice made me do it. The problem was that having already cum twice the third time was going to take a while. 

Then I had an idea. What if I made her make me leave? I pulled out and saw the disappointment on her face. I took her hand and pulled her up into a sitting position as she asked" 

"What are you doing?" 

"Changing positions." 

"Changing positions?" 

"Going to do it doggie." 

"Doggie? What's that?" 

"You have never done it doggie?" 

"Don't even know what it is." 

I got her in position and then pushed my cock into her. 

"Mike never did this with you?" 

"No. Just the way we did it the first two times." 

My opinion of Mike dropped down a few more notches. And then, wonder of wonders, Alice said: 

"This feels good" and I felt her push back at me. "Oh yeah; I like this" she said as she pushed back to meet my trusts. Plans changed. I'd intended to poke her in the butt figuring that she would tell me that she "Didn't do that" which I could then escalated into her telling me to leave, but now that she was responding I was in no hurry to leave. 

Up and in the doggie position I could see us in the mirror on the dresser against the wall and seeing Alice's 38D's swinging back and forth as I plowed into her was a turn on and I began to fuck her harder. 

"Oh yes; oh fuck yes" she cried as she drove back at me. I was looking down at her rose bud and had the thought that if Mike had never done her dog fashion he probably had never tapped her ass either. I put my thumb in my mouth to wet it and then I started working on her butt hole. I had my thumb in to the knuckle before she moaned: 

"What are you doing?" 

"Working on your butt hole to loosen it up." 

"Why are you doing that?" 

"So I can fuck you there." 

"In my behind? You can't." 

"Why not?" 

"Because it's nasty. I poop there." 

"I have to fuck you there. It is something that Mike never did and I have to do something to you that Mike never did. Something that we can let him know about." 

"You already have. Mike and I never did this dog thing." 

"Yes, but it is still my cock in your pussy. Mike has been in your mouth and pussy, but he has never been in your ass so I just have to have it." 

"But it will hurt." 

"A little bit at first since you have never done it before, but the pain won't last. I promise." 

"Are you sure?" 

"I'm not going to lie to you. I want to be able to come back and if I lie to you I'm pretty sure that you would never want to see me again." 

Which was a lie in itself. Alice was a nice girl, but I needed more from love making than just some sounds. Granted that I was getting some response from her doing her doggie, but I needed more. I needed active passionate involvement. While the talking and thinking had been going on I had been fucking Alice hard and suddenly I was at my peak and I pushed my third offering into Alice. 

I held myself in her until I softened and when I let loose of her hips she fell forward onto the bed. As soon as she fell she turned and her mouth went to my cock again. 

"What are you doing?" 

She took her mouth off me long enough to say, "You said four or five times and you have to do my ass" and she went back to sucking. 

So much for my plan of making her make me leave. Three deposits had already been made so Alice had her work cut out for her, but she was up to the task. I had to give the girl credit where credit was due. If a man could get by on just blow jobs alone Alice was the girl to tie to. I'd put a ring on her finger if her fucking was at least half as good as her sucking was. I wondered if she could be trained to be a better fuck? 

It took Alice a bit, but she finally got me to answer the call. I had her get me something to use for lube and she came back from the bathroom with Pantene shampoo. I took it and using my thumb and my fingers I worked on her hole to loosen her up. Alice was enjoying the hell out of my hand. I wondered if it would if it would carry over to my dick. 

When I felt that I had her as ready as I was likely to get her I moved up behind her, put the head of my cock against her rosebud and applied pressure. My intent was to ease in slowly and take my time getting Alice used to it. That thought lasted all of three seconds. Alice shoved her ass back at my cock and I went past the sphincter and about four inches into her in one quick shot. She gave a yelp and then moaned: 

"Fuck me. Fuck me and make the pain go away." 

I started to ease in and out slowly and she cried out, "Don't tease me. Fuck me damn it; fuck me!" 

She cried and she moaned. I caught an "It hurts; Oh God it hurts" and I was getting ready to pull out when somewhere in her body or her mind a switch was flipped on or a relay kicked in and suddenly it was: 

"Oh god yes. So good, so fucking good. Fuck me. Oh sweet Jesus fuck me. Fuck me hard" and she began driving back at me. I fucked her as hard and fast as I was able for several minutes and she fucked back. Everything that she didn't do when we did it missionary she did as I pounded her ass. 

She cried, she moaned, she begged and she pleaded for harder, faster and to never stop. And then she had an orgasm the likes of which I had never seen before. Her body went wild! As I held on and tried to stay in her I had a glimpse of what a rodeo bronc rider went through trying to hang on for a ten second ride. When she settled down I put forth a burst of effort and got myself off. 

I pulled out and Alice quickly spun around and her mouth was on its way to my cock. I dodged her and said: 

"Hold up there girl. Don't forget where that has just been." 

"I have to get you back up" she almost yelled. "We have to do that again. Please Ralph; we have to do that again. You said five. I have to do it. You have to give me five. You have to Ralph. You said you would. I need to get you hard. I need to do it. Don't push me away." 

All the while she was talking she was trying to get to my dick and I was pushing her away and doing my best to dodge her mouth. Finally I grabbed her, spun her around facing away from me and held her tight as I said: 

"Get a wash rag and clean it and then you can try to get me back up again, but I am not making you any promises. I said four OR five. I don't know if I have a fifth in me, but get me clean and you can try." 

As she hurried off to get a wash rag I reevaluated my position on Alice. So what if missionary wasn't all that hot. Doggie, anal and oral could definitely bring me back if Alice wanted to invite me. 

She came back and cleaned me up and then went to work on me, but as great as she was in giving head she couldn't make it happen for a fifth time. When she finally admitted defeat she said: 

"You have no need to go home so stay the night and we can try again in the morning." 

She was right. I didn't have to go home to my empty house and I did want to see if anal would light her up again or if the first time was just a fluke. 

It wasn't. 

She woke me up with her magnificent mouth and when I was hard she got into the dog position and said: 

"In my ass baby; I want it in my ass." 

I got the same wild ride I'd gotten the previous evening and she wanted to go a second time, but I had to beg off and go to work. 

"How about tonight? I could fix us dinner and then we would have the whole night." 

I didn't have anything planned so I accepted the invitation (and if I would have had anything planned I would have cancelled them) and she told me to be there at six. 

Alice answered my knock I a peignoir and come fuck me pumps and said that she thought we could play a little and work up an appetite so less than five minutes after I'd knocked on her door I was naked on her bed with her. 

She immediately got into the dog position and told me that she wanted it in her butt. I decided to try something. I'd brought some KY with me expecting that she would want to do anal so I loaded up my fingers and worked on her butt for a bit and then I lubed up my cock. I had her get in the missionary position, put her legs up on my shoulders and then I leaned forward. I lined my cock up with her rosebud and then I eased it in. 

She was just as responsive in that position as she was doing anal doggie and I had to wonder why so little response with me in her pussy in the missionary, but anal in the missionary wound her up. I remembered a porn film I'd seen. The film was "Deep Throat" and the premise was that the woman couldn't cum when fucking and they found out that it was because her clit was in her throat and that blow jobs would make her cum like crazy. I wondered if that might be what it was with Alice. Her clit was in her ass instead of her pussy. 

She got me to go twice more 'to work up our appetites' and then she led me to the kitchen where she fed me her famous five cheese macaroni (she won a prize with it at the county fair) and then we sat and sipped wine and talked about nothing of consequence. Once the bottle was empty she told me that it was time for dessert and she led me to the bedroom where her idea of dessert was to have my cock in her ass. 

She talked me into staying the night again and in the morning she started my day off with one of her world class blow jobs after which she wanted me to do her butt again in the missionary so I of course obliged her. 

She wanted me to call in sick and spend the day with her, but I told her that I had some very important contracts to review and submit comments on by noon of the next day so there was no way I could afford to miss work. I got the feeling that Alice wanted to move into a permanent relationship and maybe down the line I might be interested I wasn't interested at the time. I fully intended to go after Amber so being in a relationship with Alice wouldn't work. 

But I was greedy enough to want more of Miss Alice during the six month countdown to the divorce becoming final. The trick was going to be finding a balance that would work for me. I would need to accept some invitations and to turn some of them down. To see her enough to keep her happy, but not so much that folks started thinking of us as a couple. So when Alice asked if I would come to dinner that evening I would plead a previous engagement.  

===

Then I pulled myself up short. I had always been honest and upfront so why was I going to play games with Alice? That would not be the me I always thought I was. Be honest with Alice and let the chips fall where they may. 

What was it that the wise man said? Something like "Don't let your head get so big that they don't make a hat size big enough to fit you?" 

After our morning romp (anal again) Alice fixed us breakfast and over scrambled eggs and bacon Alice said: 

"I hope that you don't think that I'm a slut because of the way I've acted these last couple of days. I really did need to get laid and I really wanted it to be you so I can throw it in Mike's face, but I need to be honest here Ralph. I'm no where near being ready to get into another relationship. You are a super nice guy and a superstar in bed and maybe somewhere down the line we might be able to get something going. I'm just not ready yet. 

"I really want to do more of what we have been doing, but I don't want to be a couple. At least not yet. Are you open to maybe having a friends with benefits relationship? Maybe once a week or so?" 

What could I say to that except, "I understand completely. I feel the same way. I'm not really out of things with Mary Beth until the divorce is final in six months, but I would like to see you from time to time and not for just playing on the bed. How about dinner, drinks and dancing next Friday night?" 

"I would like that." 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Again, news travels fast in small towns. 

I was doing a load of laundry about three in the afternoon when I got a phone call from Mary Beth. 

"I see you took me up on my suggestion that you get a revenge fuck from Alice. Now that we are even can I come home?" 

"No you can't Mary Beth. We are getting divorced." 

"You aren't thinking clearly Ralph. I love you and you know full well that I d and I know that you love me. Getting divorced is just nonsense. We belong together." 

"I'm sorry Mary Beth, but I need the divorce." 

"You need it? Why?" 

"I told you that I intend to bed Amber and in fact you even suggested I do it if I remember correctly." 

"So?" 

"She says she won't mess around with a married man so I need to get divorced if I'm going to get a chance to do her. Bye Mary Beth." 

I hung up on her and got back to doing housework. 

When I got done with what I wanted to get done I decided to head into town and have dinner at Bernie's Diner. I ate and had a beer and when I left and got out to the parking lot I found Mike sitting on the tailgate of my truck. Apparently Alice had wasted no time in letting him know that I'd been on his bed and in his about to be ex-wife. He wasn't alone. He had Jimmy Farrell with him. 

Jimmy and I went all the way back to grade school and during that entire time, third grade through high school, we hadn't liked each other one little bit. We'd fought several times and we were about even in the won/loss column. I guess Mike figured with Farrell along he could take me and he probably could if I let him, but I wasn't going to do that. 

I knew Mike well enough to know he was going to want to speechify before starting the ball so I didn't let him. I walked toward the two of them and Mike sat on the tailgate and looked at me with a smirk on his face and Jimmy just stood there smiling knowing that with the two of them against me I was toast. When I got to about where they thought I would stop and start the talking I lowered my head and ran right at Farrell. They didn't expect me to attack and it caught them by surprise. I head butted Farrell in the middle of his face and broke his nose. When his hands went up to his face I kicked his right knee and drove it outward and he went down screaming. 

I spun to take on Mike, but in his haste to get off the tailgate he tripped and was stumbling to catch his balance when I got to him. I beat the fucking snot out of him stopping long enough between blows to go back and kick Jimmy to make sure he stayed down. I had Mike on the ground and I'd kicked him in the ribs hard enough to crack one or maybe even break one. I bent down and grabbed a handful of his hair and jerked his head up until it was only a couple of inches from my face and then I said: 

"I'm through fucking with you asshole. You know I have a concealed carry permit and I'm going to start using it. The next time you come after me I'll shoot your sorry ass." 

I slammed his head back onto the ground, walked over to Farrell and gave him one more kick in the ribs for good measure and then drove home. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next six months took on a sameness. A phone call or two a week from Mary Beth asking me if I'd come to my senses and was ready to let her come home. Two or three dates a week with Amber and at least once a week going out with and getting 'benefits' from Alice. 

Again small towns being what they are it didn't take long for Amber to find out about my trips to 'the benefits office' and she brought it up one night when we were at the VFW dance. I was honest with her. 

"I'm a man used to getting sex on a regular basis. I have needs and you are off limits until my divorce is final. Alice has the same needs, but doesn't want a permanent relationship nor does she want a reputation and neither of us want an emotional entanglement so we take care of each other. It works for us." 

Amber didn't say anything to that, but when I took her home that evening there wasn't the usual make out session. I began to suspect that our relationship wasn't going to last much longer. That feeling was reinforced, at least in my mind, when Amber seemed to be avoiding me at work on Monday. It didn't bother me as much as it could have because the more time I spent with Amber the less likely I saw a long term relationship in the cards for us. 

Don't get me wrong here; I would love to have a long term relationship with Amber. She was a sexy looking, drop dead gorgeous redhead and she was a fun date, but it was the age difference that was the problem. I still hadn't figured out what she was doing spending time with a man almost old enough to be her father. I had no illusions about myself. I was decent looking and in pretty good shape, but I was nothing special and Amber had a host of good looking guys her own age always trying to date her. 

We were from different generations. We didn't like the same music, TV shows, books, sports or even food. She loved oriental and I couldn't stand it. She liked hard rock and acid rock and even a little of that rap shit and I was country western, bluegrass and jazz. She liked golf and went out and hit the ball every Sunday morning and I considered that a complete waste of time just as she considered my bowling a waste of energy. We had nothing in common. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Amber was still avoiding me on Tuesday and even if she wasn't we wouldn't be doing anything that night anyway because Tuesday night was Amber's night to attend her literary club meeting at the library. Alice was in Overton visiting her sister so I had a rare free night so I stopped at The Drop Inn for a beer or two after work. About the second long neck I'd come to realize that I was in a rut. 

I was seeing Alice because I wanted sex and she was willing to give it. I was seeing Amber because she was giving me a social life while we waited for my divorce to become final. It was taking two women to do about eighty percent of what one woman used to do. True, the one had stabbed me in the back, but she had been one hell of a woman and I couldn't forget that. 

Truth be told I did miss her and I did miss the life we had. Shit! The truth was that I still loved her. She had been right when she said that I couldn't turn off my love like I was turning off a light. What a mess. What a fucking mess. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

When Amber seemed to be avoiding me on Wednesday I decided that I needed to make a change. I couldn't change the fact that Amber was unhappy that I was getting what I needed from someone else, but what I could do was take myself out of the situation where what she thought mattered. She wanted to avoid me so I would just ignore her and get on with my life. 

I made a start by picking up the phone and calling Martha Rich. Her husband Henry had a gun collection and when he died of cancer she had called me and asked me if I knew anyone who might like to buy his guns. I gave her a list of names and then forgot about it. 

Martha was a fine looking woman and I had dated her in high school and we almost had something going until Henry transferred in from some other school and whisked her away. Henry had been gone a while and I wondered if Martha was about ready to dip her toes in the dating pond and I used Henry's gun collection to open a dialog. Yes, she still had a few of the guns so I arranged to go over to see her after work. 

I took it as a good sign that she had fresh makeup on and was wearing high heels when she answered the door. She showed me what she still had left of Henry's collection. I was surprised to see that she still had his Colt model 1911A1 and I asked her what she wanted for it. She had browsed the Net for information when she decided to sell the collection so she knew what the pistol was worth and she surprised me by offering it to me for about twenty-five percent less than what it was worth. I told her that I would take it, but only if she would have dinner with me some night that week. She smiled and said: 

"Pick a night Ralph. All of them are open." 

"Friday work for you?" 

"What time?" 

"Six-thirty?" 

"I'll be ready." 

"Mexican and the Barnyard for some two stepping and line dancing?" 

"Perfect." 

I went home with a big smile on my face. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Thursday was uneventful at work. Amber had taken the day off and so I didn't have to ignore her while she avoided me. When I got off work I didn't feel like going home and cooking so I stopped at Bernie's Diner to get a bite to eat. 

The first thing I saw when I walked in the door was Mary Beth waiting tables and I wondered when she started. The last I'd heard she was pushing drinks at Bud's Bar. I knew the layout at Bernie's and how things worked so when I saw where Mary Beth was I knew what section she was working and I headed for the other section. I could have just turned around, left and gone some place else, but why bother. It was a small town and as long as we both lived there we were bound to run into each other from time to time. Might as well get used to it. 

As soon as I sat down Velma came out of the kitchen, saw me, smiled and came over to take my order. I nodded toward Mary Beth and asked: 

"When did that happen?" 

"This is her third day. Is it going to keep you from coming in?" 

"Not as long as I can avoid whatever section she is working. Although it is a safe bet that I won't be coming in if I have a date with me." 

"None of my business Ralph and I know it, but no chance of the two of you getting back together? You two were just so good together." 

"I know we were and that's the hardest part of the breakup, but no, there isn't a chance." 

She took my order, brought me a beer and then took my order into the kitchen. As I waited for my meal I read the sports section of The Times and kept the corner of my eye on Mary Beth. I wanted to be ready if she tried to do something, but outside of not taking her eyes off me when she wasn't taking care of customers she did nothing. 

My meal came and I ate it and had a second beer with it. When I finished I dropped a twenty on the table to cover the tab and the tip and then I headed for the parking lot. 

It was almost déjà vu. Some one was sitting on the tailgate. It wasn't Mike; it was Mary Beth. As I walked up she got off the tailgate and said: 

"I'm tired of trying to talk to you on the phone. Maybe in person I can make you come to your senses. We love each other Ralph. Let me come home Ralph. I need you." 

"What you need is to get it through your head is that we are a week away from being divorced. A divorce is the ending of a marriage. If I didn't want that ending I would never have started the divorce process. Get it through your head Mary Beth. We are through. Done. Over. Quits. Finished. 

"Don't waste your time telling me how much you love me because it wasn't enough to keep you from letting Mike foul your body. And yes, I still love you and a part of me always will, but the sight of you and Mike rutting on those hay bales is burned into my memory and it won't go away. Every time I see you or hear your voice that memory comes back and I see it in my head as clear as day. To keep that visual out of my head I have to keep you away. If you really love me Mary Beth stay away from me. Stay away from me and let that picture die." 

I got in my truck and drove home. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Around lunch time Amber came into y office and asked, "What time are you picking me up tonight?" 

"Tonight? What's tonight?" 

"The VFW dance. We always go." 

"Well we won't be going tonight." 

"We won't?" 

"You have ignored and avoided me all week Amber. I assumed that it was your way of telling me that you no longer wanted anything to do with me so I made other plans for tonight." 

She stood there looking at me for a few seconds and then she spun on her heels and left. 

My date with Martha went well and I received a kiss on the cheek when I took her home. I asked her if she would like to go out with me again and she said that she would like to. 

I drove home in a good mood and when I pulled into the drive I saw a car parked up next to the house. When I got closer (the drive to the house was 600 feet) I saw that the car was Amber's. She got out of the car and was standing there waiting for me when I got out of the truck and before I could say a word she said: 

"Okay, so I avoided you. It was childish of me, but I was pissed. You were supposed to be mine and you were off screwing around with another woman. How did you think that was supposed to make me feel? I know it was my own fault because of my stance on waiting until your divorce was final, but it still sucked finding out that you were seeing someone else. Did your date tonight leave enough for me?" 

"What." 

"Did your date drain you or can you get it up for me?" 

She saw the confused look on my face and said, "Never mind, I'll find out for myself." 

She grabbed my hand and started leading me to the house as she said: 

"When I get through with you this weekend you won't even want to look at another woman. You are mine Ralph. Get used to it! 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Amber was right. When she was done with me that weekend I wasn't interested in any other ladies. From then on Amber and I were a couple. 

The day after my divorce was final Amber moved in with me. My fears about the age difference dooming us before we could even start proved groundless and after living together for five months I put a ring on her finger. 

When I called Alex, Melanie and Gloria to give them the news all three said that they wanted to be there for the ceremony. When I told them it was just going to be a simple civil ceremony they said I would still need witnesses and it might as well be them. I was worried about that since I didn't know how they would take a step-mom who was only a couple of years older than they were. 

Again my fears were groundless. Gloria and Melanie arrived three days before the ceremony and Gloria immediately organized a 'girl's night out' for her, Amber and Melanie and when they came home they had bonded. The three might as well have been sisters. 

Alex arrived the day before the wedding and after meeting Amber he told me privately that he was pissed at me. 

"She's my ideal woman dad. You should have left her alone so I could have had a chance at her." 

"Don't be silly Alexander. She is four years older than you are." 

"And your point? Older women with younger men is quite common these days. In fact you should be ashamed of yourself for robbing the cradle. She is almost the same age as my sisters." 

In short, my kids approved of my choice and six months to the day after my divorce was final I said "I do" for the second time in my life and eleven months later I became a father for the fourth time when Allen Franklin joined Amber and me. I'll be in my sixties when he graduates high school, but so what? They say that kids will keep you young at heart. 

Epilog 

Mary Beth went back to work as a nurse at County General and she met and eventually married a doctor. The marriage lasted less than two years. It seems that the good doctor didn't have any more use for a cheating slut than I did. Two divorced people working at the same place created a friction that the hospital administrators decided that they could not tolerate. Doctors have more clout than nurses so because of 'budget cuts' Mary Beth was let go. She landed a job at Centura Hospital over in Overton where she got involved with another doctor. Is the third time a charm? Too soon to tell. 

Mike left town after Alice cleaned him put in their divorce and no one has heard from him since. 

Alice dated for a couple of years and then she finally met a man she felt that she could settle down with. They seem happy together. Alice and I have kept up our friendship (without benefits of course) and she and Amber have become friends. 

All in all the future turned out better for me than I could have possibly imagined that day I discovered Mary Beth and Mike in the barn.  

===

I sat on a folding chair and watched the twins as they played field hockey and I couldn't help but wonder how the coming upheaval was going to affect them. Knowing them as well as I did I thought that they would probably handle it better than I was. They were pretty resilient and a lot more mature than you would expect a pair of sixteen year olds to be. As I watched Michelle execute a pass to Melanie I thought back to the night that my world crumbled and fell on me. 

My wife Maxine and I were at a party the previous Saturday. It was a company thing to celebrate her company buying out one of their biggest competitors. The party was held at the country club probably because the president of Maxine's company was on the country club's board of directors. 

A cocktail hour was followed by a pretty good dinner which was of course followed by several speeches and then the band fired up and the drinking and dancing began. I'm not much of a dancer while Maxine would never leave the floor if she had a partner and at this party she had quite a few of them. They were what she called 'her duty dances' as she danced with her supervisors and other company big-wigs. 

About an hour into the dancing the smoke in the room began to affect me and I went outside for some fresh air. I found a bench to sit on and was sitting there looking up at the star filled sky when my attention was caught by someone saying Maxine's name. Two of her coworkers had also come out for some fresh air and apparently didn't see me because of a large potted plant that was between us. 

I recognized the voices as belonging to Roger Barnes and Sam Wickman both of whom I'd met at other social functions put on by Maxine's company. At first it didn't occur to me that it was my Maxine they were talking about, but then Sam said: 

"I'd dearly love to peel that sexy red dress off of her." 

Maxine was wearing the only red dress at the party that night. I instantly turned my full attention to their conversation. Roger said: 

"No problem getting her out of it. All you have to do is give her a drink, flirt with her a bit and she'll take it off for you." 

"You can't be serious." 

"Bet your ass I am. I've fucked her a dozen times and I know that Bill over in Procurement has fucked her several times. Terry in Finance has nailed her three times that I know of and Phil in Quality Control says he has fucked her in her ass a half dozen times. I can believe that because I've taken her ass a couple of times myself. Once I packed her shit while Ralph Means had his cock in her mouth." 

"You've got to be shitting me." 

"Not the least little bit. We tried to two hole her but she wouldn't go for it." 

"Two hole her?" 

"Yeah, you know, one in her pussy and one in her ass at the same time." 

"I don't believe it. She acts so prim and proper around the office." 

"An act Sam. Remember about three months back when we all hit the bar at the Marriott after work? Most of you left after a couple of drinks and by nine the only ones of our group still there were me and Maxine. I was getting ready to leave when a slow number began playing and Maxine pulled me out onto the dance floor. We had all ready danced four or five times, but not like that last dance. She pulled me close and half way into the song she pulled my head down and kissed me. Shoved her tongue down my throat and her hand slid down my body and she started rubbing my cock. 

"I ain't no dummy so when the song ended I asked her if she wanted to leave and she said yes. We didn't say a word all the way out to my car and she followed me straight there even though she was parked several rows over from me. I opened the back door of the car and without a word she got in, took off her panties, sweater and bra and laid down on the seat. 

"That woman has some beautiful tits and they have really big, hard nipples. I started playing with her tits and nipples and she closed her eyes and moaned and I swear that she got off from just my working on her boobs. Then I leaned back and without a word she unzipped me, took out my cock and gave me the best blow job of my life. I warned her that I was going to cum, but she never stopped and when I shot she swallowed it all. 

"I heard a noise and looked up and saw Ralph standing there and watching us through the window. I rolled the window down and he told me he would get a room and that we should meet him at the elevator. I looked at her and was about to ask her what she thought of the idea, but before I could ask she put her bra and panties in her purse and said, "Lets do it." 

"Once in the room she stripped off what she still had on, got on the bed and asked: 

"Who goes first?" 

"I wasn't fully hard from the blow job she'd given me so Ralph went first. He fucked her doggie while I pushed my dick into her mouth so she could work at getting it fully hard. Then the two of us took turns fucking her until we couldn't get it up any more. Ralph had to go home, but me and Maxine stayed the night at the hotel. She woke me with a blow job in the morning and we fucked one more time and then had to hurry to get to work on time." 

I sat there stunned by what I was hearing. When Roger first started talking I was thinking he was full of shit and just trying to make Sam think he was some kind of stud. But Maxine did have big, hard nipples and I had gotten her to climax just by working on her tits. 

Roger was still bragging. "And that was only the first time. The next time was the very next day. After work I asked her if she would like to pick up where we had left off the night before and she said she would love to." 

"Give me a break Rog. At least give me credit for some brains. She had a husband to get home to and kids to take care of and you expect me to believe she spent a night with you and was ready to do it again?" 

"Her old man travels a lot on business and he was on a trip and wasn't due back for another two days and it was spring break and her kids were spending a couple of days with her parents. Anyway, she told me to follow her home and she would fix us dinner and then we could play all night. It was one hell of a night. I even fucked her while she was talking to her husband on the phone. I had my cock buried in her ass and she wouldn't let me pull out; just made me slow down a little while she talked to him. 

"I'm not kidding you at all Sam. If you want to fuck her just stop with us the next time we stop for drinks and after she's had a couple make a move on her. I'll bet you a dollar to a candy bar that she goes for it." 

Just then a woman's voice asked them what they were talking about and Sam said they were talking sports and they all went back inside leaving me there wondering "WTF?" And right then it occurred to me that I hadn't seen Maxine in over an hour. I went back inside and looked and Maxine was not in the room so I went looking for her. 

I went room to room looking for my wife. I'd settled down somewhat and was all ready into denial. Max would never do that. The asshole was lying through his teeth. He was just trying to make Sam think he was some kind of stud. 

The last room I came to the door was locked. I went into the room next to and saw there were connecting doors, but they were also locked. I turned to leave when I heard through a shared air duct: 

"Oh God; that's it Max. Just like that. Nobody sucks cock like you do girl and I do mean nobody!" 

There was a door leading out onto the patio and I went outside to see if I could see into the next room and I was in luck. I edged up so I could look into the room around the edge of the doorframe and there was my 'loving wife' in her red party dress and she was on her knees in front of John Bartrom, the Vice- President of Sales, and she was sucking the bastard's cock. As I watched he pulled her up, bent her over the back of the chair that was next to him and pulled up her red dress. The bitch wasn't wearing any panties and he stuck his cock in her and fucked her. 

I wanted to storm in and kick ass and take names, but a more rational section of my brain was telling me to cool it. She made as much as I did so in a divorce she wouldn't get alimony as long as she had her job. If I did what I really wanted to do it would no doubt draw a crowd and it could end up with Maxine and her fuck buddy getting fired. 

I went back inside to see if I could hear anything useful through the air duct. What I heard almost made me sick to my stomach. 

"Get ready girl. I'm going to shoot." 

"Do it lover; do it. Fill me up." 

They must have finished because I could hear his zipper being pulled up. 

"I need to get back to the party because my wife is probably wondering where I am and we need to get home so the babysitter can leave." 

"Frank is probably wondering where I've gotten off to." 

"See you Monday? Take our usual long lunch?" 

"I'm all ready looking forward to it." 

I got out of the room and went back to the party. I let Maxine find me about five minutes later and we left the party. We made small talk on the way home and I did my best to keep my anger under control. She said it was a fun party and then she asked me if I had enjoyed myself. 

"It was okay. There were a couple of nice slow dances there toward the end that I wanted to dance to with you, but I couldn't find you." 

"That was probably when I was in the bathroom. I got to talking with Sally and I guess we let time get away from us." 

She said that with a smile on her face and I so wanted to backhand her lying mouth, but I kept myself under control. 

Normally after a night out we made love, but this time when we got home and before I normally made the move she said: 

"I really tired tonight and I'm going to go straight to sleep" which I took to be 'slut speak' for: 

"I'm full of another guy's jizz and I don't want you finding out." 

It was a disappointment in a way. As far as I knew I'd never had sloppy seconds before and it might have been my only chance to find out what it was like.

The sound of the shower woke me up in the morning and Maxi must have figured that she'd got enough of her fuck buddy out of her so that I wouldn't notice because when she got out of the shower she got back in bed and her mouth headed south to capture my cock.. I was pissed at the cunt, but good head is good head no matter what the circumstances so I decided to suffer through it. 

It almost came to an end when she twisted her body to get into a sixty-nine and I pushed her away. No way was I going to eat a pussy that some other dude had been in even if it was eight or nine hours before and had been washed since. Pushing her away got ma a: 

"What did you do that for?" 

"I have a foul taste in my mouth from the booze last night. When I munch on your muffin I want to enjoy the taste." 

Even to me it sounded lame, but it satisfied her and she went back to polishing my knob. When she had it as hard as she wanted it she swung over me and lowered herself down on me and began to ride. I looked up into her face and I wanted to scream out "You cheating fucking whore!" and push her off of me, but of course I didn't. For one thing the 'little head' wouldn't let me and for another in all my formative years the mantra had been "Pussy is pussy and none of it is bad" and I came from a generation that believed you should take what you can get whenever you can get it. Besides, who knew when I'd come up with another source when I kicked her cheating ass to the curb. 

And that was a definite! 

She was gone as soon as I could get all my ducks in a row. She made as much or maybe even a little more than I did so alimony wouldn't be an issue. The house was free and clear and mine before I married Maxine, but that didn't mean anything. A guy I worked with had been in the same situation, but the courts ruled that since his wife had worked and her money had helped maintain the residence she had some equity in the house. He had to sell the house in order to give her what the courts said she had coming. Even if I could keep the house the divorce wouldn't be totally painless. There were the twins to consider. 

While I'd been doing my thinking Maxi had gotten off twice and I figured that it was now my turn. I rolled her over on her back and fucked her fast and hard until I got off. I got up, showered and dressed and then went downstairs to find my girls ready to go. It was the weekend and tradition had it that we went out for breakfast. Maxi begged off saying that she wasn't hungry which didn't upset me in the least since it meant that I didn't have to sit across from her at the table and look at her cheating ass. 

We had an enjoyable brunch and when we got home the girls got ready to go to a birthday party they had been invited to and that left me home alone with Maxi. I did my best to avoid her as the anger was still too fresh and I wanted to lash out at her, but at the same time I needed to keep from her that I knew what she had been doing. When I made my move I wanted to catch her unrepaired. However Maxi managed to pick up on my mood. 

"You seem out of sort's honey. Is something wrong?" 

"Just a work problem" I said not telling her that the problem was at her work and not mine. 

That night after the girls had gone to bed I sat in my basement workshop and thought about what to do. I'd spent some time thinking on it during the day and divorce, while still ahead on points, was not as foregone a conclusion as it had been when I went to bed the night before or when I got up this morning. What was more important to me than Maxine's fidelity was what would happen to my girls? By the time I went to bed I had decided on what my first step needed to be. When I got to the bedroom Maxi was naked on the bed waiting for me. "Take it while you can get it" I told myself and I stripped and climbed on. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day the girls had hockey practice and I drove them over to the field and watched as they went through their routines and wondered, and not for the first time, if I would have had twin boys instead of girls would they have been as active athletically? Soccer, field hockey, basketball, volley ball and softball kept the girls busy and gave them a confidence in themselves that belied their years. They both had the attitude that they could do any damned thing they put their minds to. 

When practice ended I drove us over to the Dairy Queen and when they had what they wanted we went outside and sat down at one of the tables. I took a deep breath and then said: 

"Girls; dad needs some advice and I'm asking you for it because it concerns you as well as me." 

I had their attention and I went on. "Night before last I found out that your mother is cheating on me and I don't know what to do." 

Melanie looked at Michelle and Michelle shrugged and then Melanie said: 

"We had hoped that you would never find out." 

"You know?" 

"We've known for almost two years" Michelle said. 

I sat there stunned as Melanie went on, "We talked it over and decided not to tell you. We felt that as long as you didn't know the family wouldn't break up. We have friends whose parents have divorced and quite frankly we didn't want to end up living like they are. 

"We didn't want to be bounced back and forth between you and mom and we didn't want to have to make choices between you guys. We love you both and no matter what we chose one of you would have been hurt by it." 

"I know about choices sweetie. That is my problem right now. The courts are loaded in favor of the woman so if I choose divorce I'm basically choosing to give you up except for whatever visitation I am allowed. Giving up your mother is going to be hard especially after being together almost twenty years, but I honestly believe having to give you two up would come close to killing me." 

"What did mom say when you found out?" 

"She doesn't know that I know." 

"So don't tell her that you know" Michelle said. "She has been doing what she has been doing for at least two years, at least two years that we know of, and you guys have been getting along fine." 

"It isn't that simple sweetie. When I didn't know I looked on your mother as a loving and faithful wife and I was happy in my marriage and our relationship. Now that I know what she has been doing I don't see her the same way anymore. Now I see her as a backstabbing, cheating whore and I have to practically force myself to be around her. You say you have known for two years? How did you find out?" 

"You were on one of your trips and we were spending the night at Angela's" Melanie said. "It was a PJ party and there were six or seven of us there. Angie's mom and dad got into an argument over something to do with credit cards and the argument got kind of loud and made us uncomfortable so we left and came home. We could hear what was going on in the bedroom all the way downstairs. 

"We were naturally curious so we tip-toed upstairs. The bedroom door was open and we peeked in and saw mom with one of the guys she worked with. Roger something. We met him at one of mom's company picnics. We snuck back out of the house and went back to the pajama party. After that we noticed that mom always went out when you were on trips and sometimes came home with her blouses mis- buttoned, runs in her stockings, smeared makeup and stuff like that." 

Michelle jumped in with, "You wouldn't have to stay married to mom forever. You could just hang in there until we go to college." 

"It is way more complicated than that sweetie. When I look at your mother now I'm asking myself why is she doing what she is doing. Did I somehow cause it? Am I inadequate in some way? I want to grab her, shake her and scream "Why? Why have you done this to me?" And there are other considerations. You have both heard the birds and bees speech and I know that you have learned some things in health classes at school. 

"Your mom isn't just having an affair with one man. I know of at least five she has been with. I'm going to have to get myself tested for social diseases and even if she hasn't given me one yet as long as she is bouncing from man to man she is exposing herself and also exposing me if I keep on having anything to do with her. My only option would be to have nothing to do with her and quite frankly there isn't any way I can live in a sexless marriage for as long as it would take for the two of you to go out on your own." 

"There has to be some way to make it so we can stay together as a family" Melanie said. 

"I'll have to think on it some, but for now let's just keep this talk to ourselves." 

The Gods were smiling on me that day. I didn't really want to fuck Maxi. I wouldn't refuse if she was the aggressor, but I wasn't thinking good thoughts about my wife just then. After the girls had gone to bed and Maxi and I were sitting on the couch watching TV Maxi said: 

"I hope that you don't have your heart set on making love tonight. Aunt Flo showed up a day earlier than expected." 

"Damn! Ain't that just my luck! I've been waiting all afternoon and evening to get you in bed so we could play." 

"I can give you some oral loving. That will take the edge off for you." 

I didn't really want to fuck her, but I wasn't going to say no to a hum job. We took it upstairs and Maxi did indeed take the edge off for me. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When Maxine's time of the month came around it was usually four or five days before she wanted to make love again. That gave me some breathing room. Time to think on my problem. 

Over the next four days I got myself tested for STDs, got some legal advice and thought hard on what to do. In the end I decided to take it head on and let the chips fall where they may. The conversation started when Maxine asked me: 

"Would you like to play tonight? I'm ready if you are." 

"I suppose, but you need to know that my eating your pussy is a thing of the past. I'll chance sloppy seconds, but I'll be damned if I'm going to taste them."  

===

Maxine's face showed anger as she said, "And just what the hell do you mean by that?" 

"Simple. I have no way of knowing if you took on one of your fuck buddies before you came home so while I'm willing to follow them in I'm not willing to put my mouth where their cocks have been." 

"You bastard!" she cried as she swung at me to slap my face, but I was expecting it so I grabbed her wrist and said: 

"Spare me the phony indignation bullshit. I know all about Terry from Finance, Bill in Procurement, Phil in Quality Control and let us not forget Roger. Granted that I've never seen you fucking them, but at the last party I did get to watch you suck and then fuck Bartrom." 

Her face lost color when she heard that and she suddenly deflated like a balloon the air had just gone out of. 

"So back to where this conversation started. If you want to fuck tonight I'm all for it, but my doing oral on you is a thing of the past." 

I left her sitting there and went up to bed. I was not surprised when she didn't follow me up nor was I surprised when I woke up alone in the morning. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

When I came down in the morning Maxi was fixing breakfast and the twins were helping her. I gave out a cherry "Good morning all" and got myself a cup of coffee. I added cream to it and then went out and sat at the picnic table on the patio to watch the sunrise. 

After a few minutes Michelle brought me a plate with eggs, bacon and toast on it and then she and Melanie joined me. Maxi didn't come out. 

"What happened last night" Melanie asked. "When we got up this morning mom was sleeping on the couch and she looked like she had been crying all night." 

"I confronted her with what I knew about her cheating and then went to bed." 

"What is going to happen?" 

"I don't know. It is pretty much going to be up to your mother. For my part I decided to let her know and then come to an agreement to exist as a couple sharing a house, but I don't know what your mother will want to do. I'll just have to wait and see." 

"Keep us in the loop okay" Michelle asked. 

"Of course" I said and they got up and headed off to school. 

When they were gone Maxi came out and sat at the table with me. She was silent for maybe half a minute and then asked: 

"What are you going to do?" 

"Nothing. I don't want to give up the house and go and live in an apartment and I don't want to become a part time father to the girls. What I want to do is co-exist here in the house and pretend to be a loving couple to those around us. That is what I want, but you might have other ideas." 

"What do we tell the girls when we start sleeping separately?" 

"We don't sleep separately. We slept together the entire time you were cheating on me and it didn't kill me. Whether we have sex or not will be up to you, but if you do decide to keep having sex with me you need to remember that my doing oral on you isn't going to happen. I will not be a cocksucker by proxy." 

"You mean that? Keep living together? Why in the world would you want to do that?" 

"I just told you. I want to be a full time father to Melanie and Michelle and I can't be that if I'm divorced and living somewhere. Also from a financial standpoint it makes sense. Lawyers cost money and one of the things a divorce would cause would be our having to sell the house as part of the asset split. That would probably put you and the girls in an apartment. Co-existing just seems like the sensible thing to do. Like I said earlier; living together while you were doing what you were doing hasn't killed me." 

"The girls are bound to notice a difference in our relationship. What do we tell them?" 

"Why would they notice? The only change would be in the bedroom and they wouldn't be privy to that. I haven't treated you any differently since I found out about you and I see no reason for you to treat me any differently than you have since you started making love to other guys." 

"I'm not making love with other guys. I fuck them. The only man I make love with is you." 

"Whatever. You need to think about what I've proposed. We can talk more about it when I get home from work tonight." 

"I don't need to think about it. It may come as a surprise to you, but I don't want a divorce either. I love you and I want to stay married to you." 

"Given what I know about what you have been doing you are going to have a hell of a hard time selling that to me." 

I got up, got some coffee in a travel mug and headed off to work. As I drove down the freeway I was thinking of the legal advice I'd gotten. What would happen with the house would depend on the judge we drew if I went the divorce route. Of the seven sitting judges that presided over divorce cases four would bend over backward to see that the wife got everything out of the divorce she could possibly get. Two always leaned toward the man in cases where the wife was unfaithful and one was strictly a 'middle of the roader' in all cases. The odds were not in my favor. 

One suggestion that the attorney gave me would give me all the proceeds if I sold the house and then did something with the money before going for a divorce, but that would only do what I wanted to avoid. I didn't want my girls living in an apartment somewhere and probably not in as nice a neighborhood as the one we were now in. 

The optimal solution was the one I'd proposed to Maxi, but would she do it? I know she said that she didn't want a divorce and she might have meant it when she said it, but could she actually live like I proposed for any length of time before wanting out? There wasn't going to be any love there, at least not on my part. Acceptance of the situation? Yes. Sex if she wanted it? Yes. Love and affection? Not after hearing what Roger said and then seeing her with Bartrom. The touching, hugging and kissing that were once a large part of our marriage were history. It might have been different if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, but the picture of her on her knees with Bartrom's cock in her mouth was burned into my mind and came to the forefront every time I looked at Maxine. 

Luckily I was so busy at work that I had no time to spare on thoughts of Maxine and her hobby, but they crowded in on me on my way home as I wondered what Maxine was going to do. 

I had a surprise waiting for me when I got home. For the last year or so the girls would have dinner started by the time I got home. Maxi would usually get home in time to finish the dinner, but on that night Maxi was all ready home and fixing dinner when I got there. I would have thought that she would be home around her usual time since she had probably had her 'usual late lunch' with Bartrom. 

She went to kiss me when I walked into the kitchen, but I turned my head so it landed on my cheek. She looked upset that I did that and I could not resist saying: 

"What? You expected me to kiss the mouth that probably sucked Bartrom's cock during a long lunch today?" 

There was a flash of anger on her face, but she forced it away and said: 

"I called in sick. I decided that I needed to spend my time today in thinking of ways to save my marriage." 

"Did you spend as much time thinking about how to throw it away before you started cheating on me?" 

"That is water under the bridge Frank. I can't undo what has been done. We need to concentrate on the here and now." 

"What we have here and now Maxine is a cheating, backstabbing slut of a wife and an extremely pissed off husband who isn't very likely to get over it. This was no one time fling Maxine. This was no one time lapse in judgment to be put behind you and never done again. This has been going on for at least two years that I know of and with at least six different men that I know of. And you have done things with them that you never would do with me. 

"Imagine how surprised I was to hear that Roger and Phil had been fucking your tight little ass. An ass that you wouldn't let me have because the very thought of anal sex was so damned disgusting that you didn't even want it mentioned. Imagine, if you can, the look on my face when I heard that you took on Roger and Ralph at the same time in a hotel room and then spent the night in that room with Roger. 

"Imagine what the expression on my face must have looked like when I found out that the next night you brought Roger home with you, fed him dinner and then fucked him all night on our bed. Try and picture me as I learned you wouldn't let him stop fucking you as you took my phone call. 

"No Maxine; it is way, way too late for you to try and save the marriage. The best you can do is co-exist with me and try to give the girls a stable home life. Housemates with benefits if you want to look at it that way. By the way; I had myself tested for social diseases and so far I'm clear. I say so far because it sometimes takes up to six months before they can determine if you have the Aids virus or not. The way you bounce around from man to man sooner or later you are going to catch something." 

"No chance of that Frank. Condoms were always used." 

"Bullshit Maxine. I watched Bartrom bend you over a chair and fuck you from behind and he did not have a condom on." 

"He doesn't need one. He is careful because of his wife." 

"Are you brain dead Maxine? If he is cheating on his wife with you who else is he cheating with? You have no idea of where his cock has been. Is he telling you that you are the only one? If he is lying to his wife why would you expect him not to lie to you? You have been fucking with my life and health Maxine and now you want to save a marriage you have done your best to destroy? Get real!!" 

She started crying and ran from the room. I saw that the water on the stove was boiling so I added the pasta and stirred it. I checked it and stirred it occasionally as I set the table and by the time I had that done the girls were there and they chased me out of the kitchen and took over. 

Maxine did not come down for dinner and when Melanie asked why I told her that her mother and I had words earlier and that Maxi hadn't seemed to like what I had to say. 

"So what's going on pops? You said that you would keep us in the loop." 

I told them what had occurred and Michelle said, "You need to lighten up daddy. If you want her to go along with what you want you are going to have to cut her some slack." 

"I know. You're right. It is just that it is still so fresh that my anger hasn't had a chance to fade some." 

"Maybe what you need to do is schedule one of your work trips to get you away for a bit. Get away from the situation and maybe the anger will cool somewhat." 

"That would only keep it fresh in my mind because I'd know what she would be out doing while I was gone. Enough of this bad stuff. How was your day?" 

"Same old, same old" Melanie said. 

"That is so not so" Michelle said. "A new boy has transferred in and Mel hasn't been able to keep her eyes off of him. At lunch when we went into the cafeteria she saw him sitting alone at a table and the brazen hussy walked over and sat down with him totally uninvited." 

I looked at Melanie and saw that she was blushing. She saw my look and said: 

"I was supposed to stand around until some other girl snagged him?" 

That set the tone for the rest of the dinner conversation and when dinner was over I got up and started doing the clean up. When the dishes were done and put away went down into my basement workshop and puttered around until my bedtime. When I got to the bedroom I found Maxi naked and waiting. Before I could say or do anything she said: 

"You said that whether we made love or not would be up to me and I want it." 

I had said that so I undressed and joined her on the bed. She might have been making love, but I was just fucking. I fucked her as hard as I was able and in my mind I was punishing her by fucking her hard. Silly me! She was loving it. When I finished I was going to roll off and go to sleep, but Maxi had other ideas. When I got off of her she slid down, took my cock in her mouth and got me back up. As soon as I was erect she mounted me cowgirl and went to work getting us both off again. When it was over and I was lying there trying to catch my breath Maxi said: 

"I accept Frank. Coexistence, but this has to be part of it. My only condition is that you never say no to me. It goes without saying that I'll never say no to you." 

She got up to go to the bathroom and when she came back I was asleep. 

++++++++++++++ 

Tuesday I received a call from one of our customers in Dallas who was having a problem with one of our units so I called the airline, made a reservation and headed home to pack a bag. I called both girls and left a message on their voice mails (phones had to be turned off in school) and then I called Maxi to let her know what was up. I got the "Sorry, but I'm out of the office" message and of course I looked at my watch and wondered if she was having another 'long lunch' with Bartrom. I left a message and headed for the airport. 

I spent three days in Dallas and didn't bother to call home. The image of Roger fucking Maxi while she took my call jumped into the forefront of my mind every time I reached for the phone. I did call the girls on their cells and kept them up to date on my schedule and from them I got the information that their mother never went back out after getting home from work. "So what" I was thinking. "She's getting it done on long lunches." 

I flew home Friday and apparently the girls had been keeping Maxi informed of my movements because when I got home I found dinner waiting for me. The conversation over dinner was mostly the girls bringing me up to date on their doings. They had beaten Falstaff in field hockey and I had to listen to the after action play by play and then Michelle started picking on her sister and making her blush as she described Melanie's association with the new boy in school. 

"How about you Maxi? Anything going on with you?" 

"No. Just work, come home and repeat it the next day." 

I knew that she knew I didn't believe a word of it. She knew that I suspected she had fucked around while I was gone because that is what she had always done. 

Dinner over I went into the kitchen to do the dishes, but the girls told me to leave it to them. 

"You have been separated from mom for three days. You need to catch up on your snuggle and cuddle time." 

I wondered what they were up to. They knew what my relationship with Maxi was and snuggling and cuddling wasn't part of it. 

I went into the family room and plopped down in front of the TV and a minute or so later Maxi joined me. She snuggled up next to me and whispered: 

"We need to put on a show for the girls if we intend to hide what our relationship really is from them." 

I had to go along with it since keeping her from knowing that the girls already knew all about her was something I needed to do. Maxine's idea of snuggling and cuddling included lots of rubbing my cock through my trousers and of course my cock responded. It naturally got to the point where I wasn't paying any attention to what was on the TV and Maxi took my hand, got me up from the couch and led me to our bedroom. 

We stripped and Maxi surprised me by going down on me. It was a surprise because I fully expected her not to do oral on me since I'd already put her on notice that I would not reciprocate. We fucked and when I came Maxi slid down saying "We have three nights to make up for" and took me in her mouth and worked to get me up again. We went twice more before I was too whipped to go any farther. 

Maxi got out of bed and walked over to the dresser, picked up something, brought it back and handed it to me. It was from the clinic and it said that Maxi was disease free. As she handed it to me she said: 

"This is the only one of these I'll ever need to get. I know you won't believe me, but you are going to be the only one from now on." 

I just read the report and didn't say anything. Maxi went into the bathroom, I turned off the light and got under the covers and in only seconds I was asleep. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I woke up in the morning with Maxi cuddled up to me and when I stirred her hand went to my cock and one thing led to another and I worked up a sweat before I was even fully awake. She still wasn't done. She followed me into the shower and I ended up doing her from behind. She would have pulled me back to bed except I reminded her that the girls would be up and be expecting to go to breakfast. 

The girls had a game that afternoon and Maxi and I were there to cheer them on. About halfway through the game I discovered that Maxi was holding my hand and try as I might I couldn't figure out when it happened. 

The afternoon took on a slightly sour note when Michelle and Melanie's team lost, but I swelled with pride when I saw how they handled it. They made the effort to shake the victor's hands and compliment them on playing a great game. Regardless of whatever else was going to go on in my life my girls were going to be okay. 

That night was the monthly dance at the VFW and Maxi and I had always gone and so we went. I expected that there would be a bit of a sour mood on my part because two of the men that Maxi worked with were also members. They hadn't been named by Roger in his talk with Sam, but that didn't mean anything. They could still be on her list of fuck buddies. They always asked Maxi to dance and she had always said yes. It had never been all that much of a biggie to me because I had always danced with their wives, but then that was pre-Roger. 

We had been there about an hour when Marty came over and asked Maxi for a dance. Maxi surprised both of us when she turned to me and asked me if I would mind. It was the first time she had ever deferred to me when she had been asked to dance. I of course said that I wouldn't mind, but I watched them dance. Watched them closely. I didn't see anything that that made me think that they were anything other than co-workers. There was reasonable space between them, no leaning forward and whispering in an ear, no intimate touches. 

The same happened when Lou asked her to dance. She danced twice with both of them and I never saw anything untoward. Of course I wasn't watching her all the time because I did dance with Marty and Lou's wives and with a few of the other ladies there. 

About one we took our leave and as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot Maxi slid over next to me and her hand touched my cock through my pants as she said: 

"I know you want to know. It is because I am yours. I have always been yours and I will always be yours. I just decided that I need to be more proactive in showing it." 

"What in the world are you talking about?" 

"Checking with you to see if it was okay before agreeing to dance with others. I'm not stupid Frank. I know that we will never get back to what we had before, but I will do everything that I can to show you that I want to be with you." 

"Yeah! Right!" I thought, "That is why you were fucking others" but I kept my mouth shut and reached over and patted her on the leg. When we got home she wanted to make love and so we did. 

Sunday morning was a repeat of Saturday except we didn't need to hurry down and take the girls out to breakfast. When we finally did get down we found that the girls had already done breakfast and were sitting around out on the patio eating. Maxi and I fixed ourselves plates and went out to join them. When Maxine walked by and had her back to Melanie Mel gave me a 'thumbs up' and a wink. 

The rest of the day was atypical Sunday. Maxi and the girls went shopping and I worked around the house. That night Maxi again went for my cock and I didn't fight her off. 

Monday Maxi had another surprise for me. 

"I gave my two weeks notice today. My working there with the people I've been working with would be more of a strain than I want on our relationship."  

===

Two days later she had a job working for one of her previous employers competitors. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Two years went by with no major changes. There was some thawing in my attitudes and I did reach a point where I was showing some affection to Maxi. The love was gone and it wasn't coming back, but there was a little 'something' there. 

I kept a close eye on Maxi's comings and goings and I never saw anything to indicate she was screwing somewhat else. The girls kept me informed on what Maxi did while I was on my trips and according to them she came home from work and never went out. 

The girls will be leaving and going to college next month and what will happen then I don't know. I'm all for keeping the same arrangement, but I've no idea on what Maxi will want to do. 

Did I ever go after Roger or any of the other guys that Maxi had fucked? No I didn't. It is the nature of man to lust after women and Maxi was a very sexy lady. Were they assholes for going after another man's wife? Yes they were, but you can't forget that they couldn't have gotten a damned thing out of Maxi if she would have said no. 

Did I ever try and find out why Maxi did what she did? Again the answer is no. I didn't really want to know. Given how I'd felt when I found out about her extracurricular activities I don't think I could have handled it if Maxi told me that I just couldn't get the job done in the bedroom. It was easier for me to convince myself that Maxi was just oversexed and needed more than any one man could provide. 

The entire time she was cheating on me we were having sex three, four and even sometimes five times a week. After I'd found out and confronted her and she said that it would only be me from then on the sex had increased a bit. I never pushed to find out the when, why, who, where and how because I didn't want to rock the boat and possibly mess up the arrangement we had. 

A couple of times I'd sensed that she had wanted to explain herself to me, but I never gave her the chance. I was probably sticking my head in the sand, but I really didn't want to find out that it had been cause by something - real or imagined - that I'd done. All I know is that my approach, while not a common one in a case of infidelity, worked for me and my girls. Did it work for Maxi? I don't know and quite frankly I don't care.

It started one Saturday morning during summer vacation when I woke up to noise in front of my house. I looked out my bedroom window and saw a moving van parked in front of the Martin's house although I guess that it wasn't really the Martin place any more. They had moved out months ago and there had been a For Sale sign in their yard for a long time. 

I noticed that the For Sale sign was gone and men were carrying furniture into the house. Then I saw a girl about my age (10) watching the movers. She had the longest blond hair I had ever seen on a girl; it fell to below her waist and while I was looking out the window she looked toward our house and our eyes met and though I was too young to understand what happened something passed between us. 

I quickly dressed and ran downstairs, out of the house and across the street. I walked up to her and said: 

"Hi. My name is Frank and I live just across the street." 

She looked at me, gave me a dazzling smile and said, "Hello Frank. I'm Regina and we are moving into our new house." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

That was the start of it. 

The rest of the summer she was at my house or I was at hers. We walked to school together on the first day of school and we walked home together. We were pretty much inseparable all through middle school and into junior high. 

Even though we pretty much spent all of our time together she was still my first 'official date' when we went to our first high school dance together. The number of guys who asked her to dance that night should have prepared me for what was to come. Soon a lot of guys were asking Regina out and what killed me was that she said yes to a lot of them. That bothered the hell out of me because I'd always looked on Regina as mine. 

Several times I asked her to go to the movies or the penny arcade with me only to be told that she had a date with someone else. Stupid of me and I knew it, but I started looking at her going out on dates with others as 'treason' and decided to turn my back on her. No more walking to and from school together and I started avoiding her. If I saw her heading my way I changed direction and walked away from her. 

"To hell with her" I thought, there are other girls I can date and I didn't even have to look hard for them. For some reason Regina didn't get along with several of the girls in our class and two of them -- Sally Maples and Marge Haight -- started sitting with me at lunch period and from the way they talked and acted they wanted me to ask them out. I didn't realize it at the time (I was young and naïve) but Marge and Sally only wanted me because I was considered Regina's and me going with them would be the equivalent of them saying "Fuck you Regina." 

After Regina's going out with other guys finally pissed me off I asked Sally out and she said yes. I took her to the amusement park and for me the best part of the evening was that Regina was there with Norm Miller and when she saw me with Sally she got a pissed off look on her face. 

I took Sally out a couple of times and then one day Regina asked me why I hadn't asked her out lately and I bluntly told her that I was tired of being turned down. 

"Don't be that way Frank. We're young and we need to date other people to see what things are like. You know you are my best boyfriend." 

That made me feel good and Regina and I went out a half dozen times and then one night when I asked her to go to the movies with me she said sorry but she was going out with Phil that night. The next time I asked it was Rich and the time after that it was Tim. Fuck it I thought and I asked Marge out. I dated Marge for a while and then Sally and then I kind of fell into a rotation - - Marge then Sally then Marge and on and on. 

It was coming up on junior prom night and I was home working on homework when my mom called up the stairs and told me that Regina was there. I didn't say anything and a minute or so later Regina walked into my room, said "Hi" and sat down on my bed. I said "Hi" back to her and kept on working on my homework. She watched me for a bit and then she said: 

"You haven't asked me to the prom." 

"So?" 

"Aren't you going to ask me?" 

"Why should I? Maybe I don't want to hear you say no because you are going with Tim or Phil or Harry or whoever." 

"You know better than that Frank. You know that I'd never do the important stuff with anyone else." 

"No I don't know that Regina and don't give me any of that "You are my best boyfriend" crap. If that was true you would have fit me in somewhere. A date with Tim, a couple with me and then maybe a date with some other guy and a couple with me, but that isn't the way the way it has been has it? "Your best boyfriend" has been turned down the last nine times he has asked you out so you shouldn't be shocked when he finally says "screw it" and stops asking." 

"Does this mean that you aren't going to ask me to the prom?" 

"I don't know Regina. I've seen a lot more of Sally and Marge lately than I have of you so one of them might be expecting me to ask them to the prom." 

"They are only going out with you to spite me." 

"Maybe Regina, but whatever the reason they are going out with me and you haven't. The question is do I risk them not going out with me any more because I didn't ask one of them to go to the prom? That would leave me with no one to go out with since I don't seem able to get on your list." 

"So what are you going to do?" 

"Think on it." 

"Fine!" she snarled and got up and left my room. I smiled as she left and thought I'd let her stew for a day before I asked her. 

The next day during lunch period Regina stopped by the table where I was sitting and said with a smirk: 

"No need to overwork your brain cells thinking about whether or not to ask me to the prom. I'm going with Tim." 

Without even looking up at her I said, "Have fun" and kept eating my lunch. Regina stood there for five seconds or so and then she stormed off. Two minutes later Marge and Sally sat down with me and Sally asked: 

"What the hell did you just say to Regina? She was severally pissed as she stomped off." 

"I told her I wasn't taking her to the prom. In fact, I might not even go." 

"Why not?" 

"I can't make a choice." 

"A choice on what?" 

"I've been dating both you and Marge and I just don't think I can pick one of you over the other." 

They looked at each other and something seemed to pass between them and then Marge said: 

"Then I guess you will just have to take us both." 

"Both?" 

"Yes" Sally said, "Both." 

I had a great evening. I took turns dancing with Sally and Marge and on four really slow numbers the three of us danced in kind of a group hug. As an added benefit I got to watch Regina as she threw nasty glances my way most of the night. I had the additional satisfaction of watching her not be able to dance with her date. Tim had twisted his ankle during football practice and he could barely walk let alone dance. 

Marge, Sally and I had so much fun together at the prom that for the rest of our junior year we dated as a threesome. I was in the unique position of being able to give back to Regina some of what she had been giving me. A couple of times she actually asked me if I would take her out and I was able to say sorry, but I already had something going with Marge and Sally on that night. 

I knew it couldn't last and it didn't. Marge's dad got transferred and she had to move away. It was just Sally and me for a month or two and then one weekend she went to visit some relatives and when she came back she told me she couldn't see me any more. 

"I met a guy when I was at Aunt Mildred's and as soon as our eyes met sparks flew. Sorry Frank. I had a great time with you and I hope you will always be my friend." 

I remembered the connection the first time Regina and I had looked at each other and I assured her that I would and I wished her well and then she was gone." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was summer vacation and I had taken a job working for a landscaper and I had no energy to go dating when I got home even if I would have had someone I could have asked. As the summer progressed and I got more used to the hard labor I was less and less tired and started thinking of dating again. 

My parents had told me that if I kept my grades up they would help me buy a car and as soon as I had saved up a fairly large amount from my paychecks (not hard to do when all you do is go to work and then come home and die) we went looking and found a very nice 1993 Mustang convertible. It had the 5.0 engine and a five speed and at first my dad thought that it was too much car for me, but after a lot of begging and pleading he gave in. 

I started cruising the spots where the kids I knew hung out and I was able to hook up with a girl or two. One evening, three weeks after I got the car, I came home from work and found Regina sitting on the front porch steps waiting for me. "Hi" she said as I walked up to her. "Hi back" I said and then waited. 

"Can we stop all the stupid game playing Frank?" 

"What game playing?" 

"You know; me dating guys to piss you off and you dating girls to rub my nose in it. We belong together Frank and we both knew that on the day we met so no more games Frank, please?" 

And there were no more games. We were exclusive from that evening on the rest of the way through high school and college and seven months after we graduated from college we were married. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next twelve years were good ones. We had wanted kids, but after trying like hell to have one we found out that Regina was unable to carry. We didn't let the news crush us. We decided that it meant that we were to have more time to spend with each other. 

There was one problem, but it was mine and it was all my own doing. I had never been very athletic and I had never competed in sports in high school or college. The only time I had ever been in great shape was when I had worked for the landscaper and that was twelve years in the past. My job was a desk job and a lack of exercise and a steady diet of client lunches and dinners were putting the pounds on me and I knew I needed to do something about it. 

I joined a gym and started working out. At first it was three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and as I got into the routine I moved it up to five times a week. Usually I was there when the doors opened at five in the morning, but then Regina decided that it was something we could do together. She asked me if it would be okay with me and I of course said yes. I was still at the gym at five on Tuesday and Thursday, but I started going in after work on Monday, Wednesday and Friday to work out with Regina. Once Regina got in the grove she started hitting the gym on her lunch hours since it was only five minutes from where she worked and I went back to my five days at five in the morning. 

I need to point out that I wasn't hitting the gym for building strength. I was there for the exercise and to keep the pounds off. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was a tooth that brought about the situation. Specifically it was a filling coming out of a tooth. I called my dentist and she told me could get me in right away so I left work and headed on over to her office. By the time she had finished I saw no sense in going back to work just to finish out two hours so I went home. 

Regina's car was in the driveway which I found odd since her quitting time was the same as mine although she usually beat me home because where she worked was fifteen minutes closer to home. I couldn't imagine why she would be home at that time of day. 

I didn't need imagination when I walked into the house. You didn't need to be a Sherlock Holmes to deduce what the trail of women's and men's clothes from the front door to the steps leading to the upstairs bedrooms meant. With a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach I made my way up the stairs and down the hallway to the open bedroom door. 

Regina was on her hands and knees and Stan, one of the fitness instructors from the gym, was behind her and fucking her hard. She was clutching the sheets with her hands and moaning: 

"Yes, yes, yes, oh God yes." 

I stood there frozen, too stunned to move or even think. "Need to nut bitch" Stan said and he pulled out of Regina. She promptly fell on her back and spread her legs wide and as she did that she saw me standing in the door. Her face paled and she cried out: 

"Oh no! Oh God no!" 

Stan saw where she was looking and he turned his head and looked over. He smiled and said: 

"She is a damned fine piece of ass. How about giving us some privacy." 

His words vaguely registered and I clenched my fists, but even as I did it reason prevailed. No way I would accomplish anything by going after him. He was six inches taller, heavier and more muscular. He would turn me into a grease spot on the floor in seconds. For the first time in my life I regretted not having a gun although it was probably a good thing that I didn't or I'd likely spend the rest of my life in jail. 

I stood there rooted to the floor staring in sick fascination at my naked wife lying on the bed with her legs spread wide and her pussy gaping open. 

"I asked you to give us some privacy" Stan said as he got off the bed and moved toward me. I don't know what was wrong with me. I was frozen in disbelief. That was my wife on the bed. What was going on here? This couldn't possibly be. Stan put his hand in the middle of my chest and pushed me backwards and then slammed the door in my face. As the door closed I looked past Stan and saw Regina still lying there with her legs spread wide waiting for Stan to come back. I couldn't be sure, but I thought I saw tears. 

The noise of the door slamming in my face caused me to come out of the funk I was frozen in. I shook my head to clear it and started thinking about what I could do. Calling the cops wouldn't help since it was obviously not rape. I tried to think of what I had the might give me some kind of parity in the physical sense. There was nothing that came to mind. I thought of a butcher knife from the kitchen, but quickly forgot about it. The six inch advantage he had in height meant he had longer arms than I did and he could keep me from getting close enough to inflict any damage. It wasn't all that great an idea anyway since if I could get to him and did the job right I could spend life in prison. No, I had no options, at least not then, but I would get the son of a bitch. It might take me a while, but I would get him. 

There were things I needed to do so I left the house and drove to the bank. I cleaned out and closed all of our accounts and emptied the safe deposit box. I stuffed everything under the seat of the car until I could get to another bank and open an account in my name only. I drove back to what used to be my happy home, but now was just a piece of property that would be going up for sale. 

The trail of clothes had been picked up, but I could hear voices upstairs so I knew Stan was still in the house. I went into the kitchen and got the bottle of Crown Royal out of the cabinet and made myself a stiff drink. I sat down at the kitchen table and took out my wallet and started going through my credit cards. The American Express was in my name only and I had a Visa in my name only that I used for business travel. The Discover Card and MasterCard were joint and I wrote down the customer service numbers so I could call and cancel them. 

As I sat there making notes I heard them come down stairs and I heard Stan say, "Tomorrow? Same time?" and I heard Regina reply. "I'll be here." 

A couple of minutes later Regina came into the kitchen. She seemed to be surprised to see me there. She stopped in the doorway, hesitated, and then said: 

"I don't know what to say other than I'm sorry that you saw that. I'm sorry that I hurt you. I didn't mean for that to happen. You were never supposed to know." 

"What are you most sorry about Regina? Sorry for cheating on me? Or sorry that your cheating ass got caught?" 

I looked at her and she stood in the doorway and silently looked back at me. 

"You know what I'm not hearing right now Regina? I'm not hearing "Please forgive me. It was a huge mistake and it will never happen again." 

She looked away from me and said, "I can't do that." 

"You telling me that you aren't going to stop fucking Stan? Why didn't you just ask me for a divorce and get me out of the picture?" 

"I don't want a divorce." 

"That makes no sense. You don't want a divorce, but you aren't going to stop fucking Stan. I am reading this right?" 

"Yes. Look baby, you don't have anything to worry about. I love you Frank. Stan means nothing to me. It is just sex with him. Damned good sex and I don't mean to cut you when I say this, but it is the best sex of my life." 

"So I don't satisfy you is what you are telling me." 

"Yes you do satisfy me baby, but Stan does so much more. He is strong, he can go forever and he has a huge cock." 

"How can you tell me that you love me and don't want a divorce and then tell me that you are going to keep on fucking that asshole? You expect me to be that much of a wimp?" 

"You aren't a wimp baby and I know it. Please baby, just give me a little slack here. Stan won't be around forever. He's just a fling. I swear to God he is no threat to you. Come on baby; lets go upstairs and I'll prove it to you. You are my main man." 

"Oh goody! Just what I've always wanted -- sloppy seconds from my wife. Sorry Regina; it just doesn't work that way. I don't know what I'm going to do just yet, but touching your defiled body isn't on the list. You are a grown woman and as such you get to make your own choices. I can't keep you from seeing your lover if that is what you choose to do, but if you see him again and I find out about it there will be a divorce for sure. There might be one anyway, but I don't know. One thing though; if you do fuck him again it had better not be here in my house. Do you understand me?" 

"I already told him we couldn't do it here" she lied. 

"And the way you just said that tells me that you are going to fuck him again. So be it. I'll see an attorney as soon as I can get an appointment." 

"Damn it Frank! I don't want a divorce!" 

"And I don't want a cheating whore for a wife!" 

I got up and left the house and drove to work. The place was closed and everyone was gone for the day. I used my key to let myself in and went into my office. I turned on my computer and went on the Net to look for information. I found a ton and after reading and researching I made a decision. I Googled and got the address of a local company that sold what I wanted and I gave them a call and found out that they were open until nine and a half an hour later I walked in their front door. 

Regina had lied to me when she told me that she had already told Stan they couldn't do it at the house any more. She didn't know that I'd heard him say "Tomorrow? Same time?" and her reply that she would be waiting. Well I was going to be there waiting also. I made my purchase and drove home. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Regina was sitting in the living room waiting for me and as soon as she saw me she said: 

"We need to talk Frank." 

I ignored her and went upstairs, took a shower, turned out the light and went to bed. Ten minutes later Regina came to bed and moved over next to me and snuggled up against me. Her hand reached for my cock and I grabbed her wrist and pushed her away as I snarled at her: 

"Don't you dare touch me you fucking whore." 

She started crying, got out of bed and left the room. She was sleeping on the couch when I got up and left for work in the morning. I stopped at the Village Inn for breakfast and at eight I called work and told them I wouldn't be in. Not knowing what time "Same time" was I waited for Regina to leave for work and then I went home. I parked one block over from the house and then walked home.  

===

I went down into the basement and worked in my shop until noon and then I went upstairs and sat where I could watch the driveway. At one Regina pulled in and parked and a couple of minutes later Stan pulled up and parked across the street. I went out the back door and over the fence into the Miller's backyard and walked to my car. I waited five minutes and then I drove home and parked on the street in front of the house. 

I entered the house and climbed the stairs as I moved toward the room where the "Oh God yes, fill me up" was coming from. I walked up and waited in the open doorway and watched Stan as he drove his cock into Regina. Regina saw me and moaned: 

"Oh god no; not again." 

Stan turned and saw me. "Look little man" he said as he pulled out of Regina and got off the bed. "We have already had this conversation. Don't make me physically remove you from your own bedroom. I'll be done in a little while and you can come back and have a sit down with your wife and talk things out." 

"I don't think so. I warned the bitch yesterday that there would be trouble if she brought you back into the house. You are the one who is going to be leaving and the whore will be right behind you." 

He laughed and said, "And just who in the hell is going to remove me, you?" 

I said "Yes" and he laughed again and reached for me. I brought the StunMaster stun gun out from under my suit coat and pressed it into his arm. The 300,000 volt charge overwhelmed his neuromuscular system and he fell to floor like a puppet with his strings cut. As he laid there shaking and twitching I started kicking him in the nuts. I got in seven hard ones before Regina could get off the bed to try and pull me away. She grabbed me and pulled as she cried: 

"Stop it Frank! Stop it before you hurt him!" 

I pushed her away and snarled at her, "I'm trying to hurt him you stupid bitch!" and I went back to kicking him. 

Out of the corner of my eye I saw Regina pick up the table lamp from the bedside table. What she planned on doing with it I don't know because she never had a chance to do it. I still had the stun gun in my hand and I stepped over to her and touched her with it and pulled the trigger. She fell to the floor and flopped around like a fish out of water. 

I stood there looking at the booth of them and suddenly had a change of heart. My original plan had been to zap Stan, throw him out of the house and then have a long talk with Regina, but all that changed when she picked up the lamp. I quickly replaced the nine volt battery in the stun gun to make sure that I had a full charge if I needed it again. Then I went out to my tool box in the garage and got a Magic Marker and went back to the bedroom. One Regina's forehead I wrote "Frank's wife" and on Stan's chest I wrote "What happens to you when you get caught fucking Frank's wife." The letters weren't all that even and looked a little sloppy, but it was the best I could do with the two of them flopping around and twitching. 

I drug Stan's twitching body out of the house and across the front yard and dropped him on the sidewalk next to my car. According to the literature the effects of the gun were only supposed to last for from five to ten minutes and it had already been over five for Stan so I gave him another 'touch' and left him lying there as I went back in and got Regina. I carried her out and dropped her on the ground next to Stan. 

By the time I got there with Regina Stan had drawn a small crowd. Harvey, who lived in the last house on the end of the block on my side of the street asked: 

"What's going on here? Should I call the cops?" 

"No need Harv; I caught him fucking my wife and I handled it." 

I saw the neighbors all look at one another and then Mrs. Welch said, "Oh my. I never would have thought that about Regina." 

"Neither would I have Mrs. Welch, but she did and I caught her at it." 

I loaded Regina and Stan onto the back seat of my car and drove down to the gym and pulled up out in front. Stan and Regina were both showing signs of recovery so I gave them both another touch from the gun and then I pulled them out of the car and dropped them on the sidewalk in front of the gym. I got back in the car and drove off. In the rear view mirror I saw them draw a crowd as I headed for home. 

I went to the bedroom and took the bed apart and carried it out of the house and stacked it in the driveway. Because it was a king I struggled getting the mattress out, but didn't have any trouble with the two box springs. Using the same Magic Marker I used on Regina and Stan and a large piece of cardboard I made a sign that read: 

"The bed that Frank's wife cheated on. Free to anyone who wants it." 

I put the sign on the pile and went back into the house to make sure I hadn't left anything behind and then I called work and told them I had a family emergency and would be off for a couple of days. Next was a call to Tom Osbourne who was a good friend and also my attorney. I filled him in on what had happened. I told him that there was a good chance the police might get involved and I arranged for Tom to go my bail if necessary. 

Once I had all bases covered I did the last thing that anyone would expect of me. I grabbed my work-out bag and went to the gym. There was no crowd on the sidewalk when I got there and Regina and Stan were gone. I went in, signed in at the front desk and headed for the locker room to change. 

I was on the seated leg press when Bill came up to me. Bill was the manager and we had always gotten along. In fact, it was Bill who had talked me into joining the gym. I suppose that in a way that made him the one to blame for the situation. If he hadn't talked me into joining I would never have brought Regina to the gym and she would never have met Stan. I smiled to myself as I thought "now there is some fuzzy thinking for you." She wouldn't have met Stan here; she would just have met someone else somewhere else. 

Bill waited until I finished my set and then he said, "I don't suppose you happen to know anything about what took place out front earlier would you?" 

"I might." 

"Mind filling me in?" 

"I walked into the house and found the two of them going at it in the bedroom. I didn't want them in the house so I brought them here. Seemed fitting since this is where they first got together." 

"You could have let me know what you were going to do so I might have had a chance to minimize the notoriety." 

"In a way I did you a favor if you play it right." 

"What does that mean?" 

"You terminate the asshole and let it be known that you will not tolerate your employees doing such things. That will give the rest of your employees a wake up call and the word will go out to men that they won't have to worry about their wives and girlfriends if they join and do their workouts here." 

"There is that I guess." 

"What happened to the loving couple?" 

"The cops showed up, wrote them up for public indecency and then took them away. I don't know where to; probably the emergency room at the hospital or maybe the jail. Am I going to have a problem with you?" 

"Like what?" 

"Suing me for some shit or other because one of my employees took up with your wife?" 

"No, you don't have to sweat that, but if you don't fire Stan and he is here when I come in to work out there could be trouble. I doubt that he is going to take kindly to what I did to him and if he comes after me it isn't likely to be pretty." 

"No sweat. He's gone. I've had other complaints about him and the attention he pays to some of the women who work out here." 

"Oh; one last thing. Cancel Regina's membership and if there is any refund coming apply it toward the renewal of mine." 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

After my work out I headed for Antonio's for the self service salad bar. As I ate I thought about my options and decided that I didn't have all that many. They boiled down to kicking Regina out; keeping her with some major changes on her part or keeping her and living with the "new" her. Option three got a half second of consideration before being rejected and option one was ahead on points, but I decided to wait before making a decision. When I finished eating I took out my cell and called the customer service numbers I'd written down earlier and cancelled the credit cards. 

When I got home I figured I'd have to park on the street because of the bed in the drive, but the bed was gone. I pulled into the drive and parked. I considered putting the stun gun and holster in the glove box, but decided not to. I had no idea how fast Stan might have recovered and gotten his strength back and I had to allow for the fact that he might come looking for revenge. And there was also the chance the cops would pay me a visit and I might look better if I had it in a secure place. 

I walked in the front door and something slammed into the wall next to my head and fell to the floor. As I looked down and saw the heavy glass candy dish that usually sat on the coffee table I heard: 

"You rotten son of a bitch!" 

I looked to see Regina picking up the ceramic cat from the end table. She snarled "You miserable bastard" and cocked her arm to throw it at me and I snatched the stun gun out of its holster and pointed it at her. She didn't know that it had to be touching her to work and she cried out, ""No! Not that! No Frank, not that. Please Frank, not again!" and dropped the cat and it shattered as it hit the floor. 

I pointed at the candy dish and said, "Pick that up and put it back where it belongs and then clean up that mess at your feet." I put the stun gun back in its holster and walked by her into the kitchen and got myself a beer out of the fridge. I opened it, took a pull and then went down into the basement to work on the entertainment center I was building. 

Frankly I was surprised that Regina was even home. I would have thought she would be at her mother's or sister's. About a half hour after I went into the basement Regina came down the stairs, sat on the bottom step and looked at me. I ignored her and after maybe a minute she said: 

"How could you do that to me?" 

I looked over at her and noticed the "Frank's wife" was still visible on her forehead and I said: 

"Do what to you Regina?" 

"Shoot me with that thing and then do all those things to humiliate me. Do you have any idea how I felt lying naked outside with the neighbors looking at me and Stan? How it felt to have a bunch of strangers looking at me in front of the gym like I was part of some freak show? Any idea how I felt when mom brought me home and I saw some people loading our bed into their truck and the woman loading it thanked me for it? I didn't have a clue what she was talking about until I saw the sign on the ground and realized that she'd read the words on my forehead. 

"Damn it Frank I love you and I know you love me so how could you do all that to me? And you could have killed Stan." 

"Still might have to." 

"What?" 

"I still might have to kill him. You said you wouldn't give him up so the next time he is here I might have to escalate things." 

"He won't be back. When I left the hospital they were taking him into surgery. He is going to lose one or both of his testicles." 

"Couldn't happen to a more deserving guy, but that just means that he will probably come looking for revenge." 

"How could you do that to him Frank? You aren't the violent type so how could you do that to another human being?" 

"It was easy Regina. All it took was for me to find him fucking my wife and then for the two of you to call me a wimp and dismiss me like I didn't matter one little bit." 

"I never called you a wimp." 

"Maybe not in words Regina, but your actions sure enough told me what you thought of me. But why don't I answer your questions. Why did I shoot you with the stun gun? Because you were getting ready to cave in my skull with a table lamp." 

"I was not. I was going to hit you and make you stop kicking Stan." 

"That's another thing Regina. Why the concern over Stan? I'm the only one you love, right?" 

"I was afraid you would kill him and I didn't want you to go to jail." 

"Bullshit Regina. Where was your concern for me when Stan got off the bed and came for me? Where was the "Stop Stan, don't hurt him" or maybe "Don't Stan; leave him alone." You just laid there with your legs spread wide and watched and waited for him to throw me out so he could get back to fucking you." 

She started to say something, but I cut her off. "Don't interrupt Regina, I'm on a roll. You want to talk about humiliation? How about the humiliation I suffered when you told me I wasn't worth spit in bed and you had to fuck another man to get off? How about the humiliation I suffered at being told to get out of my own bedroom so your lover could continue to fuck you without having me there as a distraction? 

"How about the humiliation I suffered when those same neighbors that were looking down at you and Stan were thinking "Frank can't take care of his wife and she has to look elsewhere. I wonder what's wrong with him." I could go on and on Regina, but there is no sense in beating a dead horse. What you got is a hell of a lot less than you deserved, but not to worry; it isn't over yet." 

"What does that mean?" 

"It means that I don't know what I'm going to do yet. I've loved you since the fourth grade and it isn't something that I can't just turn off because you decided that you wanted to be a whore and a slut. I need to decide if this marriage is worth trying to save or if you have changed so much that it won't be worth the effort." 

I looked at my watch and decided that it was time to call it a night. As I put my tools away Regina said: 

"You threw the bed away. Where are we supposed to sleep?" 

"We won't be sleeping anywhere. I'll be sleeping in the spare bedroom. I have no idea where you will sleep. Maybe on the seat of your car in the garage or possibly the couch in the living room. Hell, you can even sleep on the floor in what used to be our bedroom for all I care." 

I turned off the light, stepped around her and went up the stairs. I showered and got into bed and about five minutes after I turned out the light Regina came into the room and tried to crawl into bed with me. I sat up and pushed her and she fell on the floor. 

"What the hell are you doing in here Regina?" 

"I belong in here with you Frank. I love you and you know I do. Let me show you Frank; let me show you how much I love you." 

"You already showed me Regina. You showed me just how much I meant to you when you told me you were going to keep on fucking your stud whether I liked it or not. Just get out Regina." 

"Stan wasn't about love Frank; Stan was about size. He was huge Frank and he made me feel like no one else ever had. It wasn't love Frank; it was sex, just sex. Let me prove it to you Frank." 

"I don't know if we will ever have sex again Regina, but I do know that if we do it won't be until after you can prove to me that you aren't carrying around some disease that fuckhead might have given you. Get out of here Regina. I don't want to look at you or hear your voice." 

She started crying and stared to say, "Please Fra..." and I screamed "Get the fuck out of here Regina before I get out of bed and physically throw you out!" 

She got up and still crying she left the room. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I got up early the next day and saw that Regina was sleeping on the couch in the living room. That she wasn't already up told me that she probably didn't intend to go to work that day and I thought, "Good! She can lie around the house all day and stew." 

I left and hit the IHOP for breakfast and I was standing outside Western Arms when they opened at eight. Half an hour later after filling out some forms and handing over my Visa I walked out of the store with a receipt for a Berretta 92F. I had to wait for a background check to come through before I could pick it up and the salesman told me it usually only took forty-eight hours. 

I called the man whose name the salesman had given me and for a few dollars more than he usually charged I was given a crash course in the course that was required to get a concealed carry permit for the 92F. I carried the paperwork to the sheriff's office and applied for the permit and then I headed for the hospital. 

I had timed things so that I could get there during visiting hours and when I entered Stan's room he was facing away from the door so I was able to get close to the bed before he saw me. When he saw me I saw his face screw up in anger and he moved as if he was going to get off the bed and come at me. I pulled the stun gun out of the belt holster and stood there ready as I said: 

"I don't think you really want to do that fuckhead." 

He sank back down on the bed and I holstered the stun gun. Then I said: 

"I assume that even though you are stupid enough to fuck around with other men's wives you were still smart enough to learn to read." I handed him the receipt for the 92F and said, "The fact that you are in this hospital and on this bed should show you that I'm not going to fuck around where you are concerned. You need to read that and understand what it means. You have to be close enough for me to touch for the stun gun to work and I don't feel much like gambling that you won't come after me with a baseball bat or something that will keep me from getting close enough to use it. So I've gotten something I can use if you ever get within twenty feet of me. 

"Why am I telling you this? Because I expect that you are stupid enough to come after me for revenge. I've already said it, but I'm going to repeat it just to make sure that you heard. I'm through fucking around with you. You come anywhere near me and I will assume that you mean to do me harm and I will kill you. I will not fire a warning shot and I will not try to wound you. I will empty the clip into your worthless ass and then I will spit on your body. Believe it Stan. Believe it!!" 

I took the receipt from him and left the room. I hit Denny's for a bite to eat and then I went home. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Regina was sitting in the kitchen with a wine glass in front of her and an almost empty wine bottle on the table. She looked up at me when I walked in - - took a drink -- not a sip, but a drink of her wine and then said: 

"I didn't know if you were coming home or not so I didn't fix dinner." 

"I've already eaten." 

I grabbed a beer from the icebox and headed for my basement workshop. Ten minutes later Regina came down and sat on the steps and watched me work. After several minutes she asked: 

"What are you going to do Frank?" 

"Don't know. I guess it depends." 

"Depends on what?" 

"What happens when the police finally show up. Whether or not I have to kill your lover. How I feel tomorrow, the day after or next week." 

"The police? Why would they come?" 

"Why wouldn't they? Didn't you and dickhead tell them why you were naked and on the sidewalk?" 

"We told them that it was a practical joke that was taken wrong and that we weren't going to press any charges." 

"Was that before lover boy had one or both of his nuts removed? If it was before he might change his story. Then of course there is how he may have taken my visit today. It might have upset him enough to give the cops a call." 

"Your visit?" 

"I stopped by the hospital today and showed him the receipt for the gun I bought this morning. I told him that if he ever comes within twenty feet of me I'd kill him." 

"You didn't!" 

"Oh yes I did and I meant it." 

"I don't understand why you would do something like that. I don't understand why you did what you did do. Stan was no threat to you. I told you that. I told you that it was just a fling and wouldn't last. Why did you have to go and get all macho?" 

"That is it in a nutshell Regina."  

===

"What does that mean?" 

"Getting macho. How do you think I felt after what you and your lover did to me? "Just go away Frank and when I'm done fucking him I'll let you know." That told me that as far as you were concerned I was some kind of fucking wimp that would put up with shit like that. Like I was supposed to go sit in the corner and suck my thumb and wait for your call. I was not going to let that stand! What is the opposite of wimp? Macho! For my own mental health I could not let you get away with it. 

"Physically I didn't stand a chance against your asshole fuck buddy so I did what they did in the old west when a big man fucked with the little guy. I got an equalizer. In the old west it was a six gun; in this day and age it is a Taser or a stun gun. And this morning I bought a hand gun and I stopped by the hospital to let your fuck buddy know that if he comes after me for revenge I'll kill him." 

She was silent and I ignored her as I set up the table saw to cut the boards for the shelves. Finally she said: 

"What about us?" 

"Us? Were you thinking about "us" when asshole was pounding you and you were screaming "yes, yes, yes" or was "us" somewhere miles away? Where we stand right now Regina is that I have to decide if I even like you enough anymore to keep you around. You are right when you say that you know I love you, but that isn't enough any more. Loving you didn't keep you from stabbing me in the back. You say that you love me, but that didn't keep you from stabbing me in the back either and the thought is there now that you did it once so what will keep you from doing it again? Along with that thought is the thought "Was this the first time or just the first time you got caught?" How many might there have been before Stan? How quick will she be to do it again the next time she runs across a guy with a big cock? 

"Those are questions that only you can answer Regina, but there is no trust now. Whatever your answers to those questions might be won't matter because I don't have any trust in you any more. You might be telling the truth or you might be lying. How would I know? Right at this moment all I can say is that in the "What Is Going to Happen Sweepstakes" divorce is the odds on favorite at 2 to 1. Co-exist and see what happens is at 10 to 1. Put it back together is a long shot at 70 to 1 and there are a half dozen others in the race with odds of anywhere from 8 to 1 to 60 to 1. It is just too soon to tell, but I will say this -- a rosy future for us is not looking good." 

She started crying again and ran back up stairs. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning I went into work and explained things to my boss. I told him that I didn't think I would need any more time off, but that if I did I would try to give him as much advance notice as I could. He told me not to worry and take whatever time I needed. 

"I know what you are going through Frank. Been there, done that and lost the T- shirt in the divorce." 

I spent the day doing my job while thinking about what I was going to do. It should have been a simple decision. She was a cheating slut so kick her ass out of your life, right? The problem was that I loved her and I had loved her for damned near forever and as stupid as it made me seem I did believe that she loved me. 

But was love enough? Would love overcome the way I felt when Regina told me that it didn't matter what I said she was still going to fuck Stan? Would love get me by the fact that her actions told me as plain as day what she thought of me as a man -- that I would be wimp enough to just crawl off and wait for her to call me? Could love win out over all? I didn't know. I just didn't know. 

After work I stopped at Denny's again for my evening meal and when I got home there was a truck from a furniture truck store parked in the driveway. And two men were carrying stuff into the house. When I went in Regina was directing them to carry the stuff to the master bedroom. I checked things out and saw that it was a bed. Regina saw me and said: 

"You could have told me that you cancelled all the credit cards and took all the money out of the bank." 

I nodded at the furniture and said, "It doesn't seem that it slowed you down any." 

"I had to take the money out of the savings account that I set up to pay for a Caribbean cruise." 

"Oh? When were you and studley planning on doing that?" 

"It was for us Frank. You and me. It was going to be an anniversary surprise." 

"Yeah! Right! I'm sure that I believe that." 

She gave me a disgusted look and then said, "I hit the gym at lunch and they told me that I didn't have a membership there anymore. That your doing too?" 

"I'll be damned if I'm going to pay for the place where you meet your lovers." 

"Damn it Frank! I don't have lovers. Stan was my only mistake." 

I shrugged, got my evening beer from the fridge and headed for my basement work shop. When the furniture men were done and had gone Regina came down to the basement and said: 

"How long before we sit down and talk it out Frank?" 

"Nothing to talk about Regina. Nothing you can say is going to change anything. I still don't know what I'm going to do, but you will be the first to know when I finally decide." 

"We have to talk Frank. I need to convince you that you are wrong in what you are thinking." 

"How am I wrong Regina. I saw you with him on our bed. You yourself told me that you were going to continue fucking him. How have I got that wrong?" 

"You think that because of what I did I was thinking you were a wimp. You are thinking that because of what I did that you weren't man enough to satisfy me in bed and you are thinking that because of what I did I couldn't possibly love you. All of that is wrong Frank. I love you and I have spent years showing you that I do. I do not think you are a wimp and I have never thought that. Okay, so maybe by not saying anything at the time I led you to believe it, but it had to more to do with the situation at the time. 

"I never expected to get caught and I was stunned and confused when suddenly you were there. I said nothing when Stan said what he said because I was too scared to open my mouth. Too scared and afraid I would say the wrong thing. As far as satisfying me? You are a marvelous lover Frank and you have never failed to satisfy me when we make love." 

"Then what the fuck were you doing on my bed with asswipe?" 

"I don't know if you will understand Frank, but I'll try. There isn't a woman alive who has spent time talking with her girlfriends who hasn't heard about large cocks and how great they feel. As a result I doubt that there is a woman alive who doesn't want to experience one. Most never get the chance. I probably never would have either except that one day I was at the gym to work out and I got to see Stan's. 

"Stan and one of the other trainers were playing grab-ass while they were working out and they didn't see me standing off to the side. Joe grabbed Stan's gym shorts and pulled them down. Stan was commando under his shorts and I saw his cock hanging down. Even soft it was huge. I gasped when I saw it and Stan heard and he looked over and saw me. Seeing me looking triggered something and his cock began to grow. When it was erect it looked like it was a foot long. I found out later it was ten and a half inches. Any way, I tore my eyes away from his cock and I saw him leering at me and I ran for the locker room, dressed and hurried back to work. 

"I couldn't put the sight of Stan's cock out of my mind and it was only natural that I would wonder what it would feel like. I never intended that it would happen, but I thought about it. The next time I was at the gym Stan came up to me and asked me when we were going to get together. I told him that I didn't know what he was talking about and he laughed and said he'd seen the way I looked at him and he knew I wanted it. I told him he was crazy and he laughed again and said that it was only a matter of time and he could wait. Every time I went into the gym he would hit on me and I kept telling him no, but I never stopped wondering what a big one like his would feel like. 

"It took him six weeks, but I finally decided I needed to know what it would feel like at least once. I convinced myself that you would never know and it wouldn't matter because I loved you and a big cock was not going to take me away from you. Of course it turned out that once was not enough. The first time blew my mind and I had more and bigger orgasms than I'd ever had before in my life so I did it again. The day you walked in on us was the third time. It would have ended in a little bit because Stan was the kind of guy who just had to make more conquests and he would have dropped me for the next woman he wanted to hustle. I knew it so I thought I'd just hang on for the ride until he ended things. I would have had the experience and you would have been none the wiser. He couldn't have taken me away from you Frank. No man could take me away from you." 

"You are wrong there Regina. He did take you away from me. That is why we are in the situation that we are in now. Stan and his big cock did take you away from me and you acknowledged that fact when you flat out told me to my face that you were going to continue fucking him whether I liked it or not. And your little story just now did not make things any better. He gave you more and larger orgasms than you had ever had? You think that isn't a kick in my teeth? You think that it makes me feel good to hear that I didn't get the job done in the bedroom?" 

"Damn it Frank; I told you that you are marvelous in bed. You took care of me just fine. You are mechanically minded so let me see if I can explain it in terms you can follow. You know all about mechanical and electrical devices, right? You know how a rheostat works, right? Picture a rheostat that goes from zero volts to twelve volts. You turn the dial to the number one and you get one volt applied to the circuit. You move the dial up to the number six and the circuit gets six volts. With me here?" 

I nodded a yes and wondered where the hell she was going with it. 

"Okay, so imagine my pussy as a rheostat, but instead of a round meter with a dial it is a twelve inch tube and inside the tube at one inch intervals there is a toggle switch and each time one of those toggle switches is moved it applies voltage. Now substitute pleasure for voltage. Instead of the meter reading zero to twelve volts imagine it reading zero to twelve units of pleasure. 

"You push your cock into the tube and the head of your dick reaches the first toggle switch and pushes against it and turns it on and I feel one unit of pleasure. Your cockhead reaches the second toggle, pushes against it and I get a second unit of pleasure. The same thing happens as you trip toggles three, four, five and six. The pleasure keeps increasing until you are all the way in me and then as you pound me you go just a little bit deeper and your cockhead keeps bumping against the seventh toggle switch and I'm crying at you to fuck me harder and faster to try and get you to hit that seventh toggle more and more. All the while you are making me cum, the pleasure meter is reading an average of six and half to seven units of pleasure and I'm loving it. You are doing a great job of keeping me sexually satisfied. Can you picture what I'm trying to say?" 

I nodded my head yes. 

"Okay, now imagine the same tube with a ten inch cock going in. Now switches seven, eight, nine and ten are triggered and the hard pumping occasionally bumps toggle eleven. I was perfectly satisfied at six and a half Frank. All Stan did was get four more inches into me to touch places that you couldn't get to and those places caused a higher reading on the meter. It was different Frank; that's all it was. It was just some added physical pleasure brought on by turning on a couple more switches. It wasn't love; it wasn't affection or even like. It was just sex Frank. Great sex, but just sex. With Stan I had damned good sex, but that's all. With you I had sex, love and physical and mental emotion. 

"I was brain dead when I told you I was going to keep having sex with Stan. I knew that you loved me as much as I loved you and I was sure that I could convince you that he was no threat to us and that you would love me enough to have my little fling. I did not think you were a wimp and that I could just ignore you. I was so into what Stan's cock was doing for me that I wasn't thinking straight. I honestly did think you loved me enough that you would give me the room to experience what Stan could give me. 

"There is no way to go back and reverse things, but believe me Frank when I say that I would if I could. Yes, I loved the feeling I got from Stan's extra inches, but the pleasure I got out of it wasn't worth losing you over. I'm sorry Frank. I never meant to hurt us. I'm just so sorry." 

She got up and went upstairs to the bedroom and started putting her new bed together. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day things weren't any clearer for me. I did know that until I made up my mind -- or had it made up for me -- I needed to keep a close eye on Regina. I couldn't afford to hire a private detective since I wasn't a rich man and I needed to work so I couldn't follow her myself. 

I got on the Internet and went looking for information and found a great deal of "how to" information. I found out how to tap a phone using items that could be purchased at Wal-Mart or Radio Shack and I found sites that sold spy cameras disguised as books, clocks and smoke alarms. I found places that sold 'bugs' that could be hidden in purses, shoes and even in pieces of jewelry. It was expensive, but still cheaper than hiring a private eye. 

When I was done the phone had a tap on it; her car had a GPS tracker, and a digital voice activated recorder installed. There were two spy cams in the house -- one in her bedroom and one in the living room -- and the lining in the purse she used most often had a bug planted in it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next month went by with me doing my best to avoid Regina while she was doing her best to try and get me to sit down and try to work things out. 

I made an appointment and saw an attorney and he pretty much told me what I already knew. We lived in a no fault state so assets would be divided equally. We didn't have kids so child support wouldn't be an issue. Regina and I had comparable incomes so alimony wouldn't be a factor. The sticking point would be the 401(k) s and pensions. We both had pension plans and a review would need to be done to see who got how much when we retired and an adjustment made to see that we both benefited equally. I had a 401(k) and Regina didn't so I would lose part of that. 

Since I would be the one filing I would be responsible for court costs and if Regina fought it I might even -- if we got the wrong judge -- have to pay her attorney's fees. I told him I would think on it and get back to him. 

I still didn't know what I was going to do and it looked like I had wasted a bunch of money on my 'spyware' purchases. I checked every day and there was nothing out of the ordinary. I'd almost decided that checking on Regina was a waste of time and money when suddenly Regina got a phone call from Stan on her cell phone as she was driving home from work. I could only hear her side of the conversation, but I knew it was Stan because she said his name. 

"Hello?" 

"What do you want Stan?" 

"No. I'm on my way home and I'm driving and I don't like to talk on the phone when I'm driving." 

"No Stan. I'll be home in five minutes. Call me there." 

"No. He won't be home for another hour." 

"All right." 

The call to Regina at the house was interesting as I got to listen to both sides of the conversation. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi sexy lady." 

"What do you want Stan?" 

"Is that any tone to use with the guy who rings your chimes?" 

"I asked you what you wanted." 

"You. When can we get together?" 

"I thought they had taken both of your testicles? At least that is what I heard." 

"It was touch and go there for a bit, but I've still got the magic wand. When can we get together?" 

"We can't. I'm fighting to hang onto Frank." 

"Why? He can't do for you what I can." 

"He comes damned close. Close enough anyway and he can do things for me that you never could." 

"Yeah; like I'm ever going to believe that." 

"Doesn't matter if you do or not. All you are is a big cock. Frank is the total package and I was stupid for ever risking losing him." 

"Well you are going to lose him. I owe the son of a bitch and when I get done with him he won't be any use to you or any other woman." 

"Don't do it Stan. He's expecting you to try something and he has a gun. He told me if he sees you within twenty feet of him he will kill you." 

"He has to see me first and I don't plan on letting that happen." 

"Leave him alone Stan. Please, just leave him alone." 

"Maybe. Maybe if you make it worth my while." 

"What do you want?" 

"Oh come on sexy lady; what the fuck you think I want?" 

"And if I do you will leave him alone?" 

"Cross my heart, hope to die." 

"Frank plays cards with some friends and he won't be here tomorrow. Call me about this time tomorrow and I'll see what we can work out." 

"You got it. Till tomorrow." 

Well, there it was. One of the things I'd thought about while trying to decide if I wanted to try and save things with Regina was would she likely go after a big cock again if she got the chance. It seemed like I had my answer. If she didn't tell me about the phone call it would mean that she couldn't be trusted. She still hadn't said anything by the time I knocked off working in the basement and went up to take my shower. I had my answer. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I decided to end things with a bang. I'd wait until she set up her next meeting with asshole and interrupt it the same as I had the last time only with a slight difference. I had my 92F now. 

The next day I left work early, parked a block away and walked home. I was in the basement when Regina got home and ten minutes later the phone rang. I crept to the stairs and listened so I'd know when she hung up and then I went over and listened to the conversation on the recorder that taped the house phone calls. 

"Hello?" 

"It's me." 

"Frank goes straight from work to his card game so he won't be home until eleven. How soon can you get here?" 

"Three minutes. I'm parked a couple of blocks away." 

"The door is unlocked. Just come on up to the bedroom. I'll be naked and waiting." 

I smiled as I thought "And so will I. Maybe not naked, but I will be waiting" 

A minute or so later I heard the front door open and close. I gave him enough time to get upstairs and undressed and then I pulled the slide back on the Beretta and released so it slammed forward chambering the top cartridge in the clip. 

I started up the stairs and just before I reached the top I heard someone coming. I wanted to catch the two of them in bed going at it so I hesitated. I peeked around the corner and saw Regina getting something out of one of the kitchen drawers. I was confused. She said she would be on the bed naked and waiting, but she was fully dressed. She turned and headed back to the bedroom and I gave her a minute and then followed. 

The bedroom door was open, but I didn't hear the sounds of sex. I looked in the bedroom, but didn't understand what I was seeing. Stan was lying on the bed fully dressed. He was shaking and twitching and Regina was busy tying his hands to the headboard. Her back was to me so I slipped into the bedroom across the hall and left the door open just enough so that I could look through the gap and into the room across the hall. 

Stan's thrashing was fading and Regina left the room and came back a minute or so later and I could see that she was putting something into her shirt pocket. It was small and I couldn't tell what it was. I heard Stan say:  

===

"You fucking bitch! I'll get you for this!" 

Regina got up and walked over to the dresser and picked something up. She turned back to Stan and said: 

"You want another shot of this?" and showed him what she had in her hand. I recognized it. It was a stun gun similar to the one I had. 

"After Frank showed me how effective these little suckers could be I got one to carry in my purse for self defense. Works great doesn't it. Want another shot?" 

"No." 

"Then lay there and stay still." 

She took his shoes off of him and then undid his belt and pulled his pants and boxers off and dropped them on the floor. 

"Why Stan -- what a disappointment. I'm not a sexy lady any more? Your dick is just lying there. Can't have that baby. Need you hard for the next step." 

She fondled his cock and after a minute she bent and took him in her mouth. A couple of minutes later Stan's cock was pointing up at the ceiling. Regina slowly worked his cock with her hand and said: 

"Now I want you to tell me exactly what you are planning to do to my husband." 

"Fuck you bitch." 

"Oh dear; I had hoped that we could do this civilized, but if we can't, we cant." 

She got up and walked to the dresser and picked up a knife that had been sitting there. Going back to Stan she started stroking his cock with her left hand while holding the knife in front of his eyes with her right. 

"The way this is going to go Stan is that you are going to tell me exactly what I want to know or I am going to shorten your cock one inch at a time." She placed the edge of the knife against his dick and said, "Start talking." 

He was silent and Regina's hand moved just a fraction and Stan screamed. Regina said: 

"You think I'm joking?" She held a finger in front of his eyes. "That's your blood Stan. Start talking or I cut deeper and you lose your first inch." 

"Okay, okay; just put the knife down." 

"Talk Stan. Just what have you planned for my husband?" 

"Catch him not looking and smack him in the head with a baseball bat and then use the bat to turn his cock and balls into mush." 

"Why would you want to that Stan?" 

"Because of what he did to me." 

"So he caused you some pain, so what? You don't think you earned it by screwing his wife?" 

"The son of a bitch got me fired too. Not only that but Bill told me not to expect a favorable reference if anybody called for one." 

"So you believe that you are supposed to be able to go through life fucking other men's wives and girlfriends and they are just supposed to shrug it off?" 

"No, but he could have fought me like a man instead of what he did. It just shows how much of a limp dicked wimp that he is." 

"No Stan; what it shows is that he is a very smart man. He knew he couldn't fight you because of your natural advantages." 

"Bullshit!" 

"No it isn't. You outweigh him by fifty pounds and you are a good six inches taller and that means your arms are longer. That means you could start hitting him before he could even get close enough to land a blow. He knew that so he evened things up. You earned what you got Stan. Whether you accept it or not you got what you had coming for fucking his wife." 

"I wasn't in it alone. I don't see you limping around." 

"I got hurt a lot worse than you Stan. I've lost him. You want to know real hurt lose the one you love. But we don't need to go there." 

She took something out of her shirt pocket and I saw it was a small digital tape recorder. She hit a button and waited a few seconds while it rewound and then she hit play and Stan heard "smack him in the head with a ball bat." She turned the recorded off and said: 

"Here is how we play this Stan. If anything bad happens to my husband this goes to the police. If somebody sneaks up on him and hurts him the tape goes to the police. If he is the victim of a hit and run this goes to the police. Anything bad Stan and I do mean anything bad and this tape goes to the police. Understand me?" 

I didn't hear him say anything, but he must have nodded a yes because Regina said: 

"I'm going to cut your right arm free and leave you the knife so you can cut the left free while I go outside and sit in my car and watch the front door. If you aren't out of here in five minutes I'm calling the cops. I'll tell them I'm being stalked and that the stalker is inside my house. I might even tell them that you are armed and I fear for my life." 

She cut his right wrist loose and then dropped the knife on the bed. I closed my door so she wouldn't see it open when she came out of the room. I heard her leave the house and a couple of minutes later I heard Stan leave the bedroom and go down the stairs. When I heard the front door open and then close I hurried down the stairs and went out the back door. I moved around to the side of the house and carefully peered around the corner. Regina was sitting in her car watching Stan get into his. She sat there until Stan drove away and then she got out of her car and went into the house. I ran to the fence, climbed it, dropped into the Miller's backyard and then hurried to my car. 

I spent the next two hours in Duffy's Tavern nursing a couple of drinks and thinking about what I had just seen. My mind wasn't computing all that well. There was just so much shit in there bumping in to each other. Regina's claims that she loved me were bouncing off the memory of her telling me that she was going to keep on fucking Stan. Her actions when I caught the two of them that first time pushed against her defense of me as she had Stan tied to the bed. 

It all boiled down to half of me saying, "She loves you and you love her and you know it so give her a chance." The other half was saying, "She let you down once even though she says she loves you so you can't trust her not to do it again." When I finished the drinks in front of me I got up and headed for home. 

As I drove a few things jelled in my mind. The phone calls I'd listened to and what she had done to Stan convinced me that Regina did care for me so the only questions that really had to be answered were: 

"Could I eventually get past it if I kept her?" and "If I keep her can I trust her never to do it again?" 

The problem was that there was no way to get answers. The answers could only come with time so my decision came down to "Do I give the time for those answers to come or not." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got home Regina was watching TV and she looked over at me and asked if I'd eaten yet. I told her I wasn't hungry. I stood there for a second or two, but I couldn't get the words to come so I went into the kitchen and got my nightly beer and went down into the basement. I was there maybe five minutes before Regina came down and sat on the steps and watched me work. After a minute or so she said: 

"I heard from Stan today." 

"Oh? And when are you going to get together?" 

"We aren't Frank. I let him know in no uncertain terms that we would never see each other again." 

"So why tell me?" 

"I won't hide anything from you Frank. Not ever again. I don't blame you for not believing it especially after what I did, but it is true. I don't know what you are finally going to decided to do, but if you do decide to keep us together I will do everything humanly possible to get your trust back and keep it." 

I set aside the dove-tail jig I was getting ready to set up, looked at her and said: 

"Do you understand that earning back that trust can be every bit as corrosive to our relationship as what you did to lose that trust?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Think about it Regina. I would be watching you like a hawk. I'd be watching for just the slightest hint that you were screwing around on me again. Be a half hour late coming home from work and I'd be wondering where you were and with who and doing what. You call and say you have to work late. Oh sure. You bet. I'd buy that. With who and where? 

"Go shopping and come home with nothing and tell me it was because you didn't find what you wanted and I'd be thinking "Oh yes you did get what you were looking for" and I'd wonder if it was Stan or with some other guy you found out had a big cock." 

She started to interrupt, but I held up a hand to stop her. 

"If you are on the phone with someone I'll be hovering close by with one ear cocked to catch your side of the conversation and I'll be listening to catch anything that will make me think you are talking to a lover. Your job has you going on trips several times a year and you know what I'll be thinking about how you spend your evenings at the hotel. When you get home I'll be scrutinizing you, your clothes, and your suitcase and probably going through your purse if you set it down where I can get at it. I'd be looking for the proof that would tell me that you were stabbing me in the back again. 

"Tell me Regina; could you live like that?" 

"I could if it would keep us together." 

"Well I don't know that I could Regina. Being that kind of a person is not me. I don't believe I could live like that and I don't know that I can ever get over the way I felt when you told me that you were going to keep on fucking him after I caught you." 

"I'll get you over that baby and I'll never give you any reason to doubt me ever again. I just need a chance frank. Just give me a chance." 

"I'll think about it Regina. No promises, but I will think on it." 

She reached into her pocket, took out a piece of paper and handed it to me. 

"What is this?" 

"It is what you said you would have to have." 

I looked at it and saw that it was from a clinic and it said she was drug and disease free. I read it, folded it and put it in my pocket and went back to work. Regina watched in silence for a couple of minutes and then she went back upstairs. 

Actually I'd already thought on it and I had decided to give the marriage a chance, but I also felt the need to make Regina sweat -- at least for a while. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I waited two days and then gave her the first sign of a thaw. I hadn't eaten at home since the day I dumped Stan and Regina on the lawn so on Friday morning, just before leaving for work I asked: 

"We have anything for dinner or do I need to hit the store on the way home?" 

"We don't need anything that I can think of." 

"Okay. See you tonight." 

When I got home Regina was in the kitchen and when I walked in she told me dinner would be ready in ten minutes. We ate in silence and then I went down into the basement. When I finished cutting the grass Saturday morning and was washing my hands Regina asked me what I'd like for dinner and when I said, "I thought we would go out to eat" I caught the trace of a smile as she walked away. 

She wore her sexiest dress and heels that evening and after we ate I took her to the Boom Boom Room for drinks. She wanted to dance, but I wasn't quite ready to take her in my arms. Actually that wasn't true. I was more than ready, but I was still in my "make her suffer" mood and I let most of the evening go by before I got up and moved out onto the floor with her. The results were predictable and I caught her smile when she moved her leg into my erection. 

In the car on the way home she slid over next to me and placed her hand on the lump in my trousers and waited to see what I would do. When I didn't do anything she unzipped me and worked my cock out into the open and began stroking it. When I still didn't do anything she lowered her head and took me in her mouth. It had been a while for me so it only took her minutes to get me off and when I blew she swallowed it all and kept me in her mouth. She had me erect by the time we got home. 

As the garage door came down behind us Regina took her mouth off my cock and said: 

"We have a new bed that hasn't been properly broken in. Are you ready?" 

I was. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

It has been three years now and Regina hasn't given me any reason to be suspicious. I still have a tap on the phone and the recorder and GPS tracker in her car. I have bugged three more of her most used purses and I check regularly, but have found nothing. 

I won't say that it has been easy. Every once in a while when we make love she will cry out, "Yes, yes, yes, oh God yes!" and my mind returns instantly to the day I heard those same words when I caught her and Stan and my cock starts to wilt. It is only supreme will power that allows me to stay hard and finish and I've never let her know how close we came to disaster. 

Regina does her best to spoil me rotten and I'm liking it, but I also have to admit that there is still a small spot in my brain where the thought still lives that some day she is going to want to see if a big cock can still trip those extra switches. However she does know that if it ever happens and I find out she is history and I really do think that she doesn't want that to happen. 

Time holds the answer to that. All I can do is wait and see and hope that it never happens.  

===

I was on my back, totally fucked out, and she stood next to the bed looking down at me and looking for all the world like she had just awakened and was as fresh as a daisy. No one seeing her at that moment would have believed that she had been sucking and fucking me for five hours. No one would have imagined that those lips had been wrapped around my cock and that mouth had swallowed my cum. She looked so fresh that no one would have believed that her pussy had taken two of my loads and that her ass -- her beautiful heart shaped ass -- had taken a third and fourth. She looked exactly like what she wasn't -- a sweet looking faithful wife. 

She smiled and said, "Take plenty of vitamins baby; I need you to last longer next time" and then she left me to go home to her husband and kids. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

As I had watched her dress I'd thought back on the circumstances that had brought us together. I was your typical dyed in the wool every day clueless husband. I'd been married to Ruth for a little over six years and I was happy in my marriage. I could barely stand to be away from my wife, but we both had to work if we were ever going to have the house and family that we wanted. 

All that the end of the work day meant to me was that it was time to hurry home to my lovely and loving wife. Make no mistake about it -- Ruth was my reason for being and she had been from the moment she called me a clumsy asshole. 

It had happened at Clancy's; a night spot in lower downtown. I was in the habit of stopping there after work with some of the guys I worked with to hoist a few and let off some steam by bad mouth management. Clancy's had a band Thursday through Saturday and it was a Thursday night and the place was crowded. 

Service tended to be a bit slow on live music nights because the place was so packed that the waitresses had to slowly and carefully work their way through the teaming throng. Sometimes it was quicker for you to just go up to the bar and get it yourself. I was sharing a table with seven of my co-workers (actually two tables pushed together) and four of us were dry. I volunteered to make the bar run and I'd just turned away from the bar with drinks in hand when someone ran into me and caused me to spill the drinks. I heard: 

"You clumsy asshole! Look at what you've done to my dress!" 

I turned and looked into the most startling blue eyes I'd ever seen. My eyes dropped to her dress and I saw the wet stain on h fabric covering her very impressive breasts. The lecher in me wanted to grab a towel or something and go to work on rubbing the area dry, but her tone of voice and the word "asshole" pissed me off so I fired back: 

"I was standing here lady and you ran into me; I didn't run into you so if you want to blame someone blame yourself." 

I turned back to the bar and got the bartender to top off the drinks and then went back to my table. About ten minutes later I was looking across the table at Olivia trying to talk myself into asking her if she would like to dance. Her fingers were tapping the table in time to the music and I got the feeling that she would like to take a couple of turns around the floor, but she was married and I was afraid that she might think I was trying to make a move on her. Pam, who had been sitting beside me was out on the floor with Gary and just as I thought to myself "To hell with it; I don't care if Olivia does think I want in her panties I want to dance." And as I opened my mouth to utter my first word someone sat down on Pam's chair. I could see Pam out on the dance floor so I looked to my left and saw the woman with the starling blue eyes and impressive breasts. She looked at me sheepishly and said: 

"I'm here to apologize for being nasty to you. You were right; it was my fault." 

I took a long look into those eyes and I was lost. I said, "I'll accept your apology on one condition." 

"And that is?" 

"That you dance with me." 

Her face lit up in a smile and she said, "Done!" She stood up and said, "Let's do it." 

From that moment on Ruth and I were joined at the hip. Six months later in front of family and friends we took our vows and for the next six years I considered my life perfect. 

Until. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was a cliché. We both were at a place where we had never been before. At least I never had, but her? Who knows. I was in Lone Tree, not all that far from Castle Rock, but still a place I never seldom went to. I was meeting a client for lunch and halfway into it I saw a shocked look come over his face and he mumbled to himself: 

"I wonder if Larry knows." 

"What?" I asked. 

He looked at me like he didn't understand so I said, "You just got a weird expression on your face and mumbled "I wonder if Larry knows." Since it happened in our discussion of clause five in the contract it made me wonder." 

"Oh? I wasn't aware that I said it out loud." 

He saw that I wasn't going to ask -- take it and farther -- and he must have thought that he needed to explain so he said, "Larry's girlfriend just walked in and she is holding hands with a guy who is most definitely not Larry." 

Being the curious guy that I am I turned to look. I saw a woman and a man standing at the entrance waiting to be seated by the hostess and I saw that indeed they were holding hands. The man was not someone I had ever seen before, but the woman was my wife. 

If you have ever been in a like situation you know the emotional war the instantly takes place. You wanted to get up, run to them, pull the apart and kick the shit out of the guy. There was denial. It couldn't be Ruth! It has been said that somewhere on this planet everyone has someone who looks like them. A doppelganger I believe is the term. Surely that must be what is happening here. It couldn't be my Ruth. It just couldn't. There was recognition. I recognized the dress she was wearing. I was with her when she bought it. There was curiosity. If she is Larry's girlfriend and the guy she is holding hands with is not Larry that means she is getting together with at least two guys behind your back. Are there others? How many? For how long? Then of course came acceptance. How could you not accept what was right before your eyes. 

All of the above took place in an instant -- maybe a second or so -- and then I turned to face Chad. I turned to face Chad. He took one look at my face and asked: 

"What's wrong? You look like you've just seen a ghost." 

My hand was shaking when I picked up the water glass and took a drink. As I set the glass down I said, "Not a ghost, but something just as upsetting. I know her. She is married to someone I know and that someone isn't named Larry. Who is Larry?" 

"A guy I work with. I doubt that Larry knows she is married." 

"I would appreciate your not telling him until I've had time to prepare my friend for the bad news. He worships the ground she walks on and this is going to devastate him. If Larry doesn't know maybe he will take her in when she gets kicked out of the house." 

"Not likely. Larry is married, but that brings up a question. Hubby worships the ground she walks on, but he will kick her out?" 

"No doubt in my mind. No doubt at all." 

Fortunately they were seated on the other side of the room from us and Chad told me that she was seated with her back to us and since my back was to her she did not know that I was there. I didn't finish my meal -- for some reason I had lost my appetite -- but I did finish my business with Chad and then I got up and left the restaurant. I went out through the kitchen and back door to make sure that Ruth had no idea that I'd been there and seen her. 

I stopped at the office and told my boss that Chad was on board with what we wanted to do and then I took the rest of the afternoon off. I stopped at the bank and moved some money round. Nothing that should grab Ruth's immediate attention, but I guessed that private detectives didn't come cheap. We had three accounts; a checking, a savings and the new house account. Ten percent of the net from each of our paychecks went into the new house account and the goal was twenty-five thousand for a down payment. We were still a year or so away from reaching that goal so I didn't expect that Ruth would be paying much, if any, any attention to the house fund just yet. 

I briefly flirted with the idea of just following her around myself, but quickly realized that there was any way I could do it. For one thing I couldn't take that much time away from my job and for another my inexperience at doing something like that almost guaranteed I'd somehow fuck it up and the last thing I wanted right then was for Ruth to find out I was onto her and besides, it didn't appear that we were going to need a house fund anymore anyway. 

After leaving the bank I called Jack Webster. Jack and I had been close friends since the seventh grade and Jack was an attorney. He specialized in business law, but I was hoping that he could steer me to a good divorce attorney. He told me to come into his office and he would have a list ready for me. When we met he handed me a list with thirty-one names on it. I was a touch confused and asked him which one I should see. His answer surprised me. 

"All of them." 

"All of them? All thirty-one? No way on God's green earth could I afford to do that." 

"Sure you can. You will notice that twenty-seven of them are underlined. They are the ones who give a free first consultation. The other four have a flat first consultation fee, but even then it isn't more than a hundred bucks." 

"I still don't understand why I need to see that many." 

"Because once you have talked with them they won't be able to take Ruth on as a client. That is a list of every divorce and family law attorney within fifty miles. If your problem goes the divorce route and Ruth decides to fight it she will have to go way out of the area to find an attorney who will be able to take her case. Donald Ashcroft, the one with the star next to his name is the one you will want to use. He is the 'killer whale' of divorce attorneys. Both his first and second wives cheated on him and he hates cheaters. Want me to call him?" 

I said yes, he made the call and I had an appointment to see Ashcroft at eleven o'clock the next morning. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Ruth was home when I got there. She usually got off work an hour before I did so she almost always beat me home and had dinner on the stove when I got there. I had decided that I was not going to give Ruth any indication that something was wrong between us. I could pretend to be a loving husband just as she had pretended to be a loving wife. I had no idea how long it was going to be before I split from her, but I decided that I wasn't going to go without sex until I had to. Some nights I might be getting seconds, sloppy or otherwise, but I'd had sloppy seconds before both in high school and college and they hadn't hurt me. 

Talk over dinner was the same as always and I marveled at the way my so-called loving wife could behave after sticking her knife in my back. And I also wondered about how long she had been doing it. She felt no different now than she had when I married her and I couldn't help but wonder if it had been going on all along and that's why I hadn't noticed a change. During dinner Ruth was sending me all of the usual signals that let me know she intended to fuck my socks off when we went to bed and this of course made me wonder why. Did she not get laid after her lunch date and had come home horny? Or did she get laid and she wanted to fuck me because she got a charge out of giving me her lover's leftovers? Maybe it was a guilt fuck. She felt guilty over stabbing me in the back and giving me some made her feel better. Quite often Ruth was the initiator when it came to our making love. Did the fact that we made love a lot mean that every time she made the first move it was after getting laid by some other guy? I'd damned sure be asking those questions when the confrontation came. 

One thing I was pretty sure of is that Ruth always came to our bed clean. We always started our love making with oral and I would have known what she was doing if she came to me fresh and wet from some other guy. I won't go into that other than to say it was more of that college stuff. When we went to bed that night I was as willing as I've always been and I gave a good account of myself (or at least I think I did) and made sure that Ruth had no reason to suspect that I knew that something wasn't right with our marriage. 

My meeting with Donald Ashcroft gave me a little hope. Even though we lived in a state that had no fault divorce laws and things were normally split fifty/ fifty there were some things that could go in my favor if we drew the right judge. Five of the seven judges sitting in our district had been known to cut the aggrieved party some slack in cases that involved infidelity. If I had solid proof of Ruth's adultery I could very well get out of paying alimony even though I made almost twice what Ruth made. Four of the seven had been known to make the offending party pay all attorney's fees and court costs. 

That prompted me to ask Ashcroft for a recommendation on private investigators and he gave me the name of the one he preferred to use and when I left his office I called and made an appointment. I walked into Spenser Investigations with all of the information I was asked to bring with me and after half an hour of filling in Mr. Spenser on what I knew and wanted to know I gave him a retainer and left his office. 

I would like to be able to say that things moved swiftly after that, but I can't because they didn't. It wasn't because the PI couldn't find out anything. He found out a lot, but he couldn't get me the 'slam dunk' proof I needed to put in front of a judge to prove infidelity. He had pictures and video of Ruth going into hotel rooms with two different men for long lunch hours, but that is all he had. He had some of Ruth holding hands with the two men, but no kisses caught in public. He was able to find out the men were Larry Maxon and Alex Compton and that they both worked with Ruth. 

The hotel was always the downtown Hilton and its employees must have been the most upright and ethical people in town. They could not be bribed and even though the PI tried to get four different desk clerks to work with him he could never make it happen. "We strive to protect the privacy of our guests' is what he got from whomever he approached. Even the offer of one thousand dollars was turned down. The PI just could not gain access to a room in order to obtain audio and visual proof. He couldn't even get the names or check in information of those who went into the rooms. "I cannot divulge that information without a court order" is what he got. 

We knew what was going on in the rooms, but us knowing, but not being able to put beyond a shadow of a doubt proof in front of a judge just wouldn't cut it. As Ashcroft explained to me "No sitting judge was going to make a decision based on supposition. Reasonable doubt is what any attorney hired by Ruth would point out. Both of the men she was seen going into the rooms with were fellow employees and they could say they went into that room to meet with a client and we could not prove otherwise." 

I did find out that Larry was married and had two kids and that Alex was single, but that told me nothing. I decided to just confront Ruth and let the chips fall where they may. I told Ashcroft to prepare the papers and let me know when they were ready to be served. I was going to be mean enough to have her served at work in front of all of her coworkers. I'd take the day of service off from work and have all my things moved out of the apartment and be gone before she got home. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was a Wednesday and I'd just left the office after working late on a proposal and had stopped for a beer at The Landing Strip Lounge before going home. I'd called Ruth and told her I would be late and not to hold dinner for me. It was open mike night and maybe one of the wanna be standup comics could brighten my mood. I was sitting in a booth staring down at the glass in front of me deep in thought when someone slid onto the seat across from me. I looked up and saw a lovely woman. 

"Mind if I join you Frank?" 

"Do I know you?" 

"No, but I know who you are and hopefully you will know me before the night is over and I do mean that in the biblical sense." I sat there looking at her as my mind worked on what she'd just said. 

"My name is Brenda Maxom" she said and she saw recognition register on my face and went on. "Yes, I'm Larry's wife. I have been following you for several days now looking for an opportunity to get together with you." 

"Why on Earth would you do that?" 

"Simple really. I want to find out what you plan on doing and if it is what I think it is I want to try and talk you out of it." 

I must have looked confused so she said, "I know that you know about my husband and your wife and the reason I know is that the PI I had following Larry recognized the PI you had following your wife. Knowing that you know I have to find out what you are going to do about it and if it is what I think it is I want to try and talk you out of it." 

"If you are thinking that I plan on divorcing her you are absolutely right. Why would you want to talk me out of it?" 

"Because if you divorce her the why would come out and when that happens I would have to divorce Larry." 

"If my attorney is right in what he told me you will come out of a divorce okay." 

"No I wouldn't. It is true that I would get child support and alimony and I would most likely get the house until the children are grow up, but my standard of living would take a nose dive. I have friends who have gone through divorces and without exception they will all tell you that life as a single mom sucks. I would be much better off staying married and pretending that I don't know about his affairs." 

"Affairs?" 

"Yes. Your wife is only one of many and she is the only one I have proof of, but I know there have been others. That said let me get to it. I want to stay married so I can continue to enjoy the life style I'm used to. Plus staying married will allow me to take revenge on Larry." 

"You've lost me there." 

"Larry is quite possessive and he is also insanely jealous. I'm not a bad looking broad and at parties and other social gatherings if Larry sees me talking to some guy he hurries over to separate us. My revenge is going to be doing to him what he is doing to me. I want him to continue to support me in the style which I've become accustomed to while I take on a lover and give away that which Larry considers only his. With me so far?" 

"I can see your point, but I don't see why I should forget about divorcing Ruth because it would cause problems for someone I don't even know." 

"Because it would be to your benefit." 

"Explain that please." 

"First off you don't divorce you don't have to split things fifty/fifty. Secondly there is the revenge factor. You can take a lover and then go home and go to bed with your wife knowing that you are doing to her what she is doing to you." 

"I wouldn't even know how to take on a lover." 

"You don't need to know how. All you have to be is open to the idea." 

"I don't understand what you're trying to tell me here. How is being open to the idea, as you put it, going to help me?" 

"It is simple Frank. If you are pen to the idea and willing to do it the lover will come to you." 

"You aren't making any sense here." 

"Of course I am Frank. If you are willing to go the revenge route instead of going for a divorce your partner in revenge is sitting across the table from you."  

===

"You?" 

"Can you think of a more fitting revenge than getting together with the wife of the man your wife is cheating with? Think about it Frank. No arguments over who gets what in the fifty/fifty split. No alimony being taken out of your paycheck to support her cheating ass. No paying for her attorney if she wants to fight the divorce. No court costs if you don't file and go to court. No ten weeks of visiting a marriage counselor which is something a judge almost always orders in cases where the spouse fights back and says they don't want a divorce. And there could be other benefits in it for you. Is there something sexual you would like to do that your wife won't do? I'll do them Frank." 

She must have seen a change in my facial expression when she said that because she got a big smile on her face. I thought about it for a few seconds and then I said: 

"She won't try anal. I don't even know if I would like it, but I've wanted to try it and find out what it is like." 

"Anything else?" 

"I'd like a complete blow job, but she won't do that. She will mouth me until I'm nice and hard, but then she quits and spreads her legs." 

"I do both Frank and I swallow. Anything else?" 

"Well, it really isn't sexual, but it takes sex to make it happen." 

"Oh? What is it?" 

"I want kids and she doesn't." 

"I love kids and I wouldn't mind having another one. In fact I would like two more and so would Larry, but because he wants them I've put myself on birth control just to deny him what he wants. I haven't told him that and as far as he knows we are trying to have another child. How would that be for revenge Frank? You giving me a child for Larry to raise? Hopefully it would be a boy since what Larry wants is a son to carry on the family name. Oh sweet fucking Jesus; I'm getting hot at just the thought!" 

"I don't know that I could do something like that. I'd want to a part of my child's life and I can't see anyway that could happen if I were to get you pregnant." 

"I guess you are right on that, but I can't think of a greater revenge on Larry. I can address that later after you get tired of me. I'll let my next lover get me pregnant and I just won't let him know that the child is his. So how about it Frank? Are you in?"  

===

I was waiting to board an airplane that would take me from Atlanta to home. I'd been sitting and people watching when she came into the boarding area and took a seat. I recognized her right away even though it had been twelve years since I'd last seen her. 

Shayleen Murphy had been my fantasy girl from the time I'd first laid eyes on her the first day of class at the start of the eighth grade. As she sat and fiddled with her cell phone I watched her. In fact I could not take my eyes off of her. She noticed and after maybe five minutes she got up and came over to me. 

"Why are you staring at me? Do I have something in my hair?" 

"No. I was just admiring your beauty. I thought you were perfection in high school, but I was wrong. Perfection means as good as it gets, but you are definitely much, much better now." 

"High school? Do I know you?" 

"Maybe know of me, but you didn't actually know me." 

"Care to explain that to me?" 

"I was just one of the 186 in our class. I was around and you would have seen me, but I don't remember you ever speaking to me from the eighth grade on." 

"You're kidding me." 

"Not in the least. You were the most popular girl in our class and you ran with the cheerleaders and jocks. I was with the nerds and geeks. The two groups never socialized and even if they would have I wouldn't have been there. I had to work in the family business after school so I never was wherever it was that you went to socialize after school." 

She took a step back and looked me over and then said, "You have to be pulling my leg. If you were really in my class I would recognize you even if we never socialized." 

"Try to imagine me with coke bottle lens glasses, forty pound heavier and with a hair cut that looked like a bowl had been placed on my head and all the exposed hair had been cut off." 

She stared at me for a bit and then said, "Frank. Frank Dalton." 

"Close. Frank Denton." 

Before she could say anything the announcement came that they were boarding rows ten through fourteen. 

"That's me" I said as I picked up my carryon bag. "Nice seeing you again Shayleen" and I headed for my seat. 

The airplane was only half full and I had the window seat. We were at altitude and I was looking down at the ground through breaks in the clouds when some one sat down in the aisle seat. I looked and saw Shayleen sitting there, Since rows one through eight were first class and I hadn't see Shayleen walk past my seat when the plane was loaded I assumed that she was sitting in first class. She saw the question on my face and said: 

"Tell me more about my having improved on what you originally thought was perfection." 

"What can I say? You were my dream girl. The girl all my fantasies were built on." 

"Oooooh, that sounds good. Tell me more." 

By the time our flight had landed Shayleen and I had exchanged our vitals. She had finished college and had gone to work as a CPA, gotten married and then divorced. She was currently single and not looking. From me she found out that I was twice divorced and was running the family business that my grandfather had started and where I had worked since I was fourteen. As we taxied to the gate I asked: 

"Would my dream girl have dinner with me some evening?" 

"I'd like that. I'm usually free most nights except Wednesdays. That is the night I play cards with some of the girls who were in my sorority. 

"Would this Friday work for you?" 

"Yes it would." 

We exchanged phone numbers, she gave me her address and I told her I would pick her up at six-thirty. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

As I drove home from the airport I was thinking about the odds of my ever getting a date with Shayleen Murphy. It was a given that the teenaged goddess would never have given the teenaged geek a second look, but laser surgery had eliminated the coke bottle lens glasses and my first wife Glenda had been responsible for all of the other changes in me. 

I met Glenda during my freshman year at State. She had the seat next to me in Introduction to Business Law and we started talking while waiting for the instructor to show up. Later that day I was in the student cafeteria and she came in and saw me and asked if she could join me. We talked and got to know each other. I liked her and she seemed to like me and we started spending time together. Not dates, but things like joining each other in the cafeteria and studying together in the library. 

By the time I met Glenda my eye problems had been taken care of, but I was about forty pounds overweight and I had absolutely no sense of style. My mother had taken off when I was about six leaving dad to raise me. He did his best, but he was busy trying to run the business that my grandfather had left him and I had a succession of nannies and baby sitters until I was about twelve. He put in late hours and I was pretty much left on my own. 

By the time I was twelve I was fixing my own breakfast, making my own lunch and more often than not I was handling dinner also. Quite naturally I was eating what I liked and, also quite naturally, what I liked was fattening and not really good for me. 

Dad gave me a pretty hefty allowance and it was understood that I was supposed to take care of things like clothes and haircuts with the money. I learned early that in order to have spending money for the things I really wanted I needed to buy the cheapest clothes I could find and wear then until I had absolutely no choice but replace them. 

Tommy was my next door neighbor and one day I was bitching to him about the high cost of haircuts and his mother overheard us and she told me that she would cut my hair for a third of what the barbershop charged. She did Tommy's hair and it looked okay to me so I jumped at the chance to put more spending money in my pocket. My haircuts looked okay to me, but some of the kids laughed and told me that I looked dorky, but I didn't care. I might have looked dorky to some, but I was still able to get dates and the girls I dated made out with me and after Pauline French took my cherry as an eighteenth birthday present and I was getting laid on a fairly regular basis I didn't care one whit about what others thought about my hair. Of course I found out later that I got the dates because I had the money to spend and a lot of other guys my age didn't. 

Anyway, back to Glenda. 

After three weeks of spending time with Glenda I asked her out. I was pulled up short when she told me that I needed to make some changes before she would let herself be seen with me on a date. She was uncomfortably blunt about it. 

"You dress like you get all of your clothes out of a rag bin and your hair looks like you stuck your head in a fan to get it cut." 

She saw the look on my face and said, "No one else ever told you how you look?" 

"Not really." 

"Who buys your clothes?" 

"I do." 

"Figures. I'll bet that you don't go to a real barber either do you?" 

"No." 

She contemplated me for a bit and then she said, "I'm appointing myself your style coordinator. Think of it as my being your personal trainer for clothes and appearance." 

She took me in hand and in our free time she drug me around to stores and picked out things for me to buy. She forced me to go to a regular barber and after a week or so she was done with me and she said: 

"You'll do. Where are we going on our first date?" 

We started making out on our third date and a month later we made love for the first time. Glenda wasn't my first piece of ass, but she gave me my first blow job and I ate pussy for the first time. Glenda was really into oral and sixty- nine became a regular occurrence when we made love. Glenda was also the first one to do anal with me. 

After we had been making love for a couple of weeks Glenda told me that I needed to lose some weight. 

"No girl wants to have a big belly lying on top of her. I guess it is time for me to go back into personal trainer mode." 

She came up with a program for me that included running every day and she was ruthless in making me follow it. Follow it I did and the pounds came off. Slowly, but they did come off. I fully admit that I did all of what Glenda wanted because I was pussy whipped. We were making love four and five times a week and we were doing it all. Glenda was especially into oral and anal and I was getting as much as I could handle. 

Just before finals in our freshman year Glenda came to me and told me that we had a problem. 

"I'm pregnant Frank." 

"I thought that you were on the pill." 

I am, but I think that the medicine I took when I had the flu screwed things up. What are we going to do about it Frank?" 

"We will have to get married." 

My dad's response to that was, "I think that you are too young to be getting married Frank, but then I guess that you do have to accept the responsibility. I was your age when I married your mother and look how that turned out. There is one thing though. Your lady is going to have to sign a prenuptial agreement exempting the business in the case of a divorce." 

"I don't know if she will do that." 

"Then I won't leave the business to you. I'll leave it to your children. It is going to stay in the family. All of it." 

Glenda did sign the pre-nup and we were married in a civil ceremony. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Three months after we were married Glenda miscarried. She had gone to Michigan to visit her sick grandmother and had fallen down some steps. Two weeks later I found out that it was all bullshit. 

I had purchased a digital voice activated recorder for taping classes since it was easier for me than taking notes. I was sitting at the kitchen table in our apartment listening to it when the phone rang and I pushed the stop button and answered the phone. It was some guy trying to drum up support for someone running for office. 

When I hung up the phone I looked at the clock and saw what time it was. Glenda was bringing her friend Tara home with her and I had promised to take care of dinner. I had intended to order pizza, but had forgotten. I called the pizza place and placed an order to go. I was leaving to pick up the pizzas when Glenda and Tara came into the apartment. I gave Glenda a quick kiss and then left to go pick up dinner. 

We ate and socialized with Tara and after she left Glenda and I went to bed. Glenda was really horny that night and I was exhausted when I finally was able to go to sleep. 

The next day I had a thirty minute break between my first and second class so I went to the cafeteria, got a cup of coffee and a sweet roll and sat down at a table to review the recording of the last class. I didn't fully rewind because I still had yesterday's last class on it. I rewound to where I thought the start of the day's class would be and hit play. 

"....did you get Frank to believe that you were at your grandmother's?" 

"He isn't too bright. I mean he did buy the phony pregnancy." 

The first voice was Tara's and the second was Glenda's. Phony pregnancy? Not too bright? I must have left the recorder on and their voices had activated it. I kept hitting rewind and play until I got to where the two of them came into the kitchen. I heard the front door close behind me and then Tara said: 

"You did a good job on him. I'd probably even date him now." 

"Oh no you don't you slut. He's my gravy train." 

"Listen to you. Calling me a slut. The girl who spent a full week in Roger's bed. How did you get Frank to believe that you were at your grandmother's?" 

"He's not too bright. I mean he did buy the phony pregnancy. I needed an excuse to be gone a few days so I could have my miscarriage without anyone seeing that it was phony. Besides, Roger has a great cock and I love fucking him." 

"The plan still the same?" 

"Yep. Wait six months and then get pregnant for real. Either by Frank or Roger; it doesn't really matter which one does it. Then Roger sees to it that Frank's old man passes on and leaves the business to Frank. After a decent interval Roger will see to it that something happens to Frank and I'll inherit. Worst case is that Frank's father's will will be written to leave the business to Frank's kids, but as their mother I'll control things until they are old enough to take over. I'll never be poor again." 

"There are a hell of a lot of 'what if's' in there. You getting caught cheating on Frank with Roger for one." 

"Never happen. I'm way too careful for that." 

The rest of it was them talking about other things until I got home with the pizzas. 

Well 'Way too careful Glenda' I thought, one of those 'what if's' just bit you on your ass. 

I skipped the rest of my classes that day and went to see my dad. I played the tape for him. He called our attorney and I went to see him and played the tape for him and he called an assistant district attorney that he knew and we played the tape for him. The net result? After everything was over and done with I had an annulment and Glenda was doing a year and a day in the can. Roger was arrested, but made bail and skipped town. 

But I did owe her for my makeover so I sent her a carton of cigarettes. She didn't smoke, but I'd heard that cigarettes are used as currency in jail. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Friday I picked up Shayleen at six and asked her what her preference was when it came to eating out and she said anything but oriental so I took her to Carl's Chop House. 

Over dinner we talked and she told me the sad tale of her marriage. She had married Todd Lucero who had been the star quarterback at our high school. He had gotten an athletic scholarship and had gone off to become a stand out college quarterback. 

Shayleen had gone to the same university and they had hooked up, gone steady and gotten engaged. They got married when they graduated. Todd was drafted by the Denver Broncos and he looked like a sure bet to make the team as a starter. He did start the second game of the pre-season. But a hard tackle had blown out his right knee and his career was over before it even got started. 

He became a bitter and abusive drunk and the second time he sent Shayleen to the emergency room she got rid of him. 

"Since then I have dated some, but have devoted most of my time to my career. What's your story? Two ex-wives already and not yet thirty? Should I even be out with you? Were you some kind of monster to those two girls?" 

She said it with a grin, but I knew that for her it was a really important question and a lot hinged on my answer. I told her about Glenda and how that had turned out and then I had to tell her about Gloria. 

When I graduated with my Bachelor's in Business Management I did not go into the family business right away. It pissed off my dad no end, but as I told him I had never worked any place other than the family business and I wanted to experience a few other things. I would try a few other things and after two or three years I would join the family business. 

I sent out a couple of dozen resumes and when Apex Industries offered me a position I took it. I was in my second week there and I was sitting in the break room having a cup of coffee when a very good looking redhead came over and asked if she could join me. We introduced ourselves. 

"You must be new. I've not seen you before." 

"I started two weeks ago." 

"Where do they have you?" 

"I'm in Asset Management. What do you do for the outfit?" 

"I'm in Accounting." 

I glanced at my watch and saw that it was time for me to get back to my desk so I told her that it was nice meeting her and that maybe we could have coffee again some time. 

Over the next couple of weeks we ran into each other several times in the break room and either I joined her or she joined me. We had coffee and talked and then one day I asked her to have dinner with me and she accepted. We had a fun date and I asked for another and she again said yes. The second date led to a series of dates. We had been dating for two months when one night when I brought her home she gave me a kiss and said: 

"It is time for you to fish or cut bait Frank." 

"What does that mean?" 

"You either like me enough to take things to the next level or you don't. Which is it?" 

We took things to the next level and then again three or four nights a week for the next three months. Then I asked her to marry me. She said yes and again my father insisted on a pre-nup and Gloria signed it without saying a word. 

We were married and I thought that we had a good and strong marriage. Silly me. 

After two years I left Apex and went into the family business. Six months after joining the business I went out of town on a buying trip. I was supposed to be gone three days, but I managed to get everything done in two and the evening of the second day I caught the late flight home. I called Gloria to let her know I'd be home early, but got the recorded message. I tried to get her on her cell, but it went to voice mail. 

I got home and let myself into the house and before the door even closed behind me I knew what was going on in the bedroom. I knew what I was going to find so I put my cell phone in picture taking mode and walked into the bedroom. I got three shots before they noticed me and another four while they scrambled to separate. 

I put the phone in my pocket, picked up the man's pants and took out his wallet and read the information off of his driver's license. I dropped the wallet on the floor and waited to see what Barry Wasour was going to do. He looked ready to fight so I said: 

"This is the way it goes down asshole. This is her house as well as mine so she has every right to invite people in. If I attack you I go to jail for assaulting you in a place that you had a right to be. You can hit me if you want to and I won't even defend myself until you get two punches in and then I'll half kill you and you will be the one going to jail for assaulting me. 

"That does not mean that you will get a free ride out of this. What it means is that I know your name and where you live and I'll be seeing you down the road somewhere. So either get dressed and get out or take your best shot." 

He hesitated and then shrugged, got dressed and left. While he was dressing I told Gloria to get dressed and get out. She dressed without a word and then left. 

I saw an attorney the next day and filed for a divorce and Gloria didn't fight it. Three weeks later a man in a ski mask beat Barry Wasour so bad that he had to go to the emergency room at County General. The police paid me a visit, but fortunately for me Josh Barnum was able to tell them that Mike Mattson and I were helping him change the engine in his truck at the time of Barry's assault. 

I told the story to Shayleen and added, "I never spoke with Gloria after she left the house that night so I have no idea of the why of it or how long it had been going on." 

Shayleen smiled and said, "Would you like to know?" 

"Not really. I don't think my ego could handle it if the reason was that I wasn't getting the job done." 

"I don't think that was the reason at all. I told you on the plane that I was a CPA but I didn't tell you that I was the head of Accounting at Apex. Gloria Marcella worked in my department. For some reason known only to God and the Human Resources department all the employees in Accounting are women and women are terrible gossips when there are no men around. 

"Gloria was engaged to be married to Barry Wasour and whenever the girls talked about men Gloria positively gushed over Barry. He could do no wrong. He was perfect in every way. He was the love of her life. As far as she was concerned their love was planned by the Gods. 

"One month before the wedding Barry told Gloria that he wasn't going to marry her and he left town. She was devastated and was pretty much a basket case for the next couple of months and then suddenly her mood changed. She had met another man. You, being a man and not used to noticing such things, probably didn't notice that you and Barry look a lot alike. Same size, same hair coloring, close to the same features. You got Gloria on the rebound and most likely it was because you reminded her so much of Barry. Then she got married and we didn't hear about Barry anymore.  

===

"About two years after she got married she came into work in a really bubbly mood and when one of the girls asked her what had her on such a high she said, and as I recall it, these are her exact words." 

"My Barry is back and he wants me." 

"Two weeks later she was telling every one that she was getting divorced so she and Barry could be together again. So two weeks is probably the answer to how long and the fact that you weren't Barry is probably the 'why' of it. She is still at Apex. She isn't a very happy lady. Barry dumped her and she realizes she screed up the good thing she had with a man who loved her in order to be with a man who didn't." 

I shrugged and she went on. 

"What seems odd to me is that you and I never saw each other. I was in that break room two or three times a day. You would think that we would have run into each other at least once in the hallways, lobby or parking lot." 

"I guess the fates weren't ready to put us together at that time. They must have wanted me to be rid of my baggage before they put us together."" 

"The fates? You think we were fated to meet in Atlanta?" 

"Absolutely. What are the odds on my fantasy girl showing up in the boarding area where I was sitting and then getting up and coming over to me because I couldn't take my eyes off of her? How many times have you gone over to talk to men who looked at you because they were so taken with your beauty that they couldn't take their eyes off of you? I'll bet that the total would be one and that one was that day in Atlanta. Am I right?" 

She smiled and said, "I'll never tell." 

After dinner we went to The Boom Boom Room for drinks and dancing. Dancing with Shayleen was a dream come to life. She fit. It sounds simple, but it was true. She fit into my arms like she was made for me. It was a great evening for me and as I drove her home I told her how much I had enjoyed her company and that I hoped we could do it again. I was stunned when she said that she hoped so too. 

Consider my mindset at the time. Two disastrous relationships with the opposite sex. I was probably the most insecure man in a six state area and the girl I had dreamed about all the way through high school just told me that she would like to go out with me again. Add to my insecurities that I considered Shayleen to be way, way out of my league and it was no wonder that I was stunned. I stared ahead at the road as my mind raced and then Shayleen said, 

"Well say something." 

"I'm thinking, I'm thinking. Do you like classical music?" 

"As long as it isn't opera. Why?" 

"There is an all Beethoven concert at the Civic Center Auditorium Wednesday evening. Would you like to go?" 

"I would indeed." 

I was walking on air as I escorted her to her door ad then said goodnight. She went up on her toes (I was 6'1" and she was 5'2") and kissed me on the cheek and I felt as if I had just won the lottery. I slept very well that night. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

We had a grand time at the concert and when I took her home I asked her to go out with me on Friday and she said yes. That began a relationship that had us dating two or three times a week. 

On one of those dates I picked her up from work because her car was in the shop. As I got out of the car to open the door for Shayleen I saw Gloria come out the front door of the building. She stopped when she saw me holding the door for Shayleen and she stood there and stared. I maybe wrong, but I thought the look on her face was one of sadness. 

After the second week the kisses were on the lips instead of the cheek. I ached for Shayleen. I wanted so badly to make love to her that it was driving me crazy, but I was always conscience of the fact that I thought that Shay was way out of my league and I didn't want to do anything that might scare her off. And to be absolutely honest in the back of my mind was the thought that I'd had two wives and something had to be wrong with me because both of them had gone to other men. Roger in Glenda's case and Barry in Gloria's. What if I tried with Shayleen and disappointed her and she wouldn't see me again? 

I was driving Shayleen home from an evening of country/western dancing when she said: 

"Are we going anywhere?" 

"Just home unless you have somewhere else you want to go." 

"That isn't what I mean and you know it. Is our relationship going anywhere or are we going to be just friends?" 

The question caught me flatfooted and I didn't say anything. 

"Talk to me Frank." 

I took a deep breath and then said, "I want it to go somewhere. God knows that I want us to last forever, but I'm afraid." 

"Afraid of what?" 

"That I won't be man enough for you." 

"And why would you think that?" 

I explained my fears and she said, "Those stupid girls really did a number on you didn't they." 

I shrugged and said, "Girls are always joking about how fragile a man's ego is, but even though they are joking it is still a truth. Between what Glenda did with Roger and Gloria did with Barry my ego is so low that it is keeping company with whale shit and as you know that is on the bottom of the ocean. If I were to be a disappointment to you I don't know that I could ever recover from it. With those thoughts on my mind I've been afraid to try and take our relationship any farther." 

"If I am understanding you right you are saying that you want me, but are afraid that you won't be man enough for me right?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"Well it might just surprise you to know that I have the same fears. I'm afraid that I might not be woman enough for you. The only way either of us is going to find out the answer is to make it happen." 

She said that just as we were pulling into her driveway. I parked and looked over at her and asked: 

"Are you sure?" 

"Come on in and find out." 

I can't speak for Shay on my performance, but she was more than woman enough for me. We made out like teenagers on her couch until she pulled away from me. Took my hand and led me to her bedroom. We undressed each other and then she got on the bed and waited. I saw her face register surprise when instead of mounting her I settled in to eat her pussy. I munched on her until she panted: 

"I want you in me Frank. Please Frank. Please make love to me." 

I moved up and slid into her and then made slow gentle love to her until she cried out: 

"Harder. Fuck me harder." 

I did as she asked and I was rewarded for my efforts when she had a screaming orgasm. An actual loud screaming orgasm. Glenda and Gloria had orgasms when we had sex, but never loud screaming ones. I came and held myself in Shay until I softened and then I rolled over and settled in beside her. She rolled onto her side, put her arms around me and held me tight. After a bit she murmured into my chest: 

"If you don't ask me to marry you after that I'll kill you." 

I held her tight and said, "I'm too young to die so I guess I'll have to do it, but I won't ask until I have the ring and can do it in the traditional way." 

"We can shop for the ring in the morning." 

She slid down, took my cock in her mouth and we made love twice more before falling asleep in each other's arms. 

I woke up alone, but I smelled the coffee and I got up and followed my nose into the kitchen. Shay smiled at me, poured me a cup and told me where the cream and sugar were and then asked me how I liked my eggs. I told her scrambled and then sat down at the kitchen table to sip my coffee and watch her work. After a minute I asked: 

"Did last night really happen or was it just a dream?" 

"You bet your sweet ass it did and I'm holding you to it. The malls open at nine and we are going ring shopping." 

++++++++++++++++++ 

One the way to the Miracle Mile Mall I asked Shayleen, "Why on earth were you afraid that you wouldn't be enough for me?" 

She was quiet for several seconds and then she said, "If I was woman enough I should have been able to pull Todd through his depression and give him a reason to work at keeping me happy. I couldn't do that and I finally had to give up on him. 

"After my divorce I dated several guys, went to bed with a few of them, but after a couple of times they dropped me and moved on to other women. I became the female version of how you saw yourself. Always asking myself what was wrong with me/" 

"All I can say is that if there was a problem it was with them and not you." 

She looked away from me and stared out the passenger side window for about a minute and then said: 

"I'm not being completely honest with you." 

"What are you not being honest about?" 

"Let me ask you a question. If you had feelings for a woman wouldn't you fight for her?" 

"Of course I would." 

"Well apparently I wasn't woman enough for the guys I was interested in to want me enough to fight for me." 

"I don't understand what you are trying to tell me." 

"Todd threatens every man I seem to take an interest in. He catches them alone some place and tells them to stay away from me if they know what's good for them. Most just stayed away from me after he talked to them, but two of them told him to stuff it and he beat them up pretty badly and then warned them that if they pressed charges he would find a way for them to 'accidentally die' when he got out of jail. They must have believed him because they never called the police. They did call me and tell me that they couldn't see me any more and why. 

"I called the police and then tried to get a restraining order, but I was told that there was nothing they could do since I wasn't the one he was threatening. They did urge me to try and get the men he threatened to come forward, but none of them would." 

"He hasn't done anything to you?" 

"Not since the last time he sent me to the hospital. He did call me once or twice a month to ask me if I'd come to my senses yet and was ready to come back to him. I told him it would be a cold day in hell before we would ever get back together. He hasn't called in almost four months so I guess he has finally accepted things. Either that or he has moved away." 

"We have been seeing each other for three and a half months and I have not seen him." 

"I just hope he is gone and I never hear from him again." 

"Not to worry my love. Even if he shows I'm not going anywhere. You are stuck with me for life." 

We found the ring she wanted at Zales and it was in her size so I paid for it and put the box in my pocket. I intended a romantic dinner that evening and for dessert have the ring brought to the table on a silver tray. I would then get on my knees and ask her to marry me, but as we walked past the fountain in the mall's center court I changed my mind. I stopped Shay and turned her to me and then took a knee. I took the box out of my pocket, took out the ring and held it out to her and asked her to be my wife. She got down on her knees, hugged and kissed me and said she would love to marry me. I slipped the ring on her finger and then we raced home to celebrate. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

We had both gone the big wedding route before and decided that we didn't want to do it again. We decided that a simple civil ceremony would do it for us. We went for the license and the blood tests and then sat down and talked thing over. We decided that she would sell her house and we would keep mine. She moved in with me and put her house up for sale. 

Even though we had decided on a civil ceremony we knew we would have to do something for friends and relatives so we started planning a celebration/party/ reception and sent out invitations. 

It was a Monday night and Shay was in Memphis doing an audit on the Apex facility there. I was sitting on a stool at Frank's Place, a bar close to work, and enjoying a cold beer. I had been coming into Frank's Place since way before I was even old enough to drink. I used to come in with my dad after work and drink a Coke while he and some of the men from the plant drank beer and talked. 

I was on very friendly terms with Fred who was the bartender. Fred also owned the place and why it was named Frank's Place and not Fred's Place is something that I could never get Fred to tell me. 

I was nursing my beer and watching Monday Night Football on the TV up on the wall at the end of the bar. The Bronco's were playing Kansas City and so far it was a scoreless tie. A guy sat down on the stool next to me on my right which I thought strange since there were four open stools to my left and there had been five empties to my right. 

The guy ordered a Bud and when Fred set it down in front of him he took a pull, swallowed and then turned to me and asked: 

"Do you believe in promises?" 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"Do you believe that promises should be kept?" 

"I guess I do, but I guess it would depend on circumstances." 

"Like what?" 

"Were they made jokingly or seriously?" 

"Ones that are made seriously." 

"Then they should be kept unless something happens to make it impossible to keep them." 

"That's not the way I see it. A promise made in a serious situation should be kept no matter what." 

"Why are we having this conversation?" 

"It is simple really. In front of God and eighty-six friends and relatives Shayleen promised to be mine until death do us part. She also promised to be mine for better or worse and I'm holding her to those promises. You need to stay away from her. Her getting a divorce is meaningless. She is mine until we are parted by death." 

"Sorry, but I don't see it that way." 

"You had better because if you don't I'll beat you half to death and I'll keep on doing it until you get the message." 

I waved Fred over. "Are we on good enough terms that I can ask you for a huge favor?" 

"You can't have my wife. But I guess I'm open for just about anything else." 

The bar stools we were sitting on were the swivel type and I picked up my beer as though I was going to take a drink and then I swiveled and threw the beer in Lucero's face. His hands went up to his eyes and I grabbed my beer bottle by its long neck and swung it hitting Lucero hard on the side of his head. He fell off the bar stool onto the floor and I got up and kicked him twice in the nuts and once in the ribs. I turned to Fred and said: 

"The favor I need is for you not to call the cops. This asshole is Shay's ex- husband and he just warned me to stay away from her or he was going to kick my ass. I'm going to take him out to the alley and have a little talk with him. Okay with you?" 

"Not a problem Frank." 

I grabbed Lucero by his shirt collar and drug him to the back door. Fred opened the door for me and held it open while I pulled Lucero out into the alley and then proceeded to beat the living shit out of him. I broke his nose, dislocated his jaw and I think I broke a rib or two. When I got tired I sat him up against the brick wall and said: 

"Listen to me asswipe. Pay very close attention. You stay away from Shay and you stay away from me. If I see you again I'll take care of that till death do us part thing that you think is so important. I'm as serious as death here. You come anywhere near either of us and I'll put you in your grave. And don't bother going to the police. You saw how Fred acted. He will back me when the cops show up. You came in, started an argument with me and then hit me. I defended myself and you lost. The rest of the people in the bar know me and will back me up. What you need to do is go away and stay away. Understand?" 

He didn't say anything so I grabbed a handful of his hair and slammed his head back against the brick wall and asked again. 

"Do you understand me?" 

"Yes." 

"Yes what?" 

"I understand you." 

"Best that you do Lucero; best that you do." 

I went back into the bar and bought a round for the house (all four of them) and then sat down to watch the game. I didn't tell Shay about my meeting with Lucero because I saw no reason to possibly upset her. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

I try very hard not to be stupid. I realized from what Shay had told me of her ex that he was quite possibly unstable and prone to reckless behavior and I knew that he wasn't very happy about the outcome of our meeting. I decided that it would be best if I were to be prepared in case there was a second meeting with him. 

Frontier Firearms had just what I was looking for. I purchased a Llama .380 which is a small copy of the Colt 1911 A1. I had to wait two days for my background check to come back and then I took delivery of the pistol and went to an indoor range and got familiar with it. I took the eight hour class necessary to get the certificate needed to get a concealed carry permit, took it to the sheriff's department, got the permit and then hoped that I had wasted my time and money. 

Several weeks went by with no sign of Lucero and I began to think that I'd read the man wrong. It was a Wednesday night and Shay was off playing cards with her sorority sisters so I had the evening to myself. Because I had no place to go and nothing to do I decided to stay late at the office and clear up some paperwork. 

It was seven –ten and already turning dark when I left the building and headed for the lone car in the parking lot. Three men came around the corner of the back of the building and headed toward me. One of them was Lucero. 

"About time you came out asshole. This time it is your turn to be a punching bag." 

"Don't think so asswipe. I told you that if you ever came near me again I'd take care of that death do us part thing you were so concerned with" I said as I reached under my sports coat for the .38o in the hip holster. I pulled it out, pulled back the slide and released it to chamber a round and then I pointed it at the three men and pulled the trigger. 

The sound of the shot split the silence of the night. I'd deliberately aimed the shot into the space between Lucero and one of his buddies, but they didn't know that. As far as they knew I was shooting at them. I saw the wet spot appear on the front of Lucero's pants before he and his two pals turned and ran back the way they came. I fired another shot into the air to spur them along and they got to the end of the building and turned the corner and they were gone. I policed up my brass, got in my car and took a quick look around and didn't see anyone. With any luck anyone who heard the shots wouldn't associate them with gunshots at least not in that neighborhood. 

I went home, broke the weapon down and thoroughly cleaned it. I tossed the clothes I was wearing into the washing machine and then I got in the shower. I scrubbed my right hand and forearm with a brush a couple of times. My hope was that I could get rid of any gunshot residue in case the police did come to call. Even if no one saw what happened I couldn't be sure that Lucero wouldn't be stupid enough to tell the cops I'd shot at him. If he did he was setting himself and his buddies up, but I didn't give him credit for having much in the way of brains. If the cops did show up and couldn't find any evidence (GSR featured big on cop and CSI shows) it would be my word against his and he did have a history of screwing around with the men who saw his ex-wife. I would claim that he made it all up to get me tossed in jail and have to put the wedding off. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was in bed asleep when Shay got home, but that didn't stop her from waking me up with a blow job. 

"Sorry baby" she said when I was fully awake, "But I'm horny as hell and I need you to do something to take care of the problem." 

I of course did what was needed and then we snuggled up and fell asleep. In the morning I asked her what had fired her up the previous evening. 

"I can't tell you." 

"Why not?" 

"Because what the girls talk about while we play cards stays with us. All I can tell you is that what one of the girls told us last night turned me on something fierce." 

I kept trying to get it out of her, but she wouldn't budge other than to say if we kept talking about it she would keep thinking about it and that would have her trying to fuck me to death. Needless to say I decided to bring the subject up often. What I didn't realize at the time was that there was going to come a day when I would wish that I hadn't.  

===

++++++++++++++++ 

When I got to the office in the morning I did something I should have done the day after my first encounter with Lucero. I made an appointment with a private investigator. That afternoon I saw him and gave him the information I had taken from Lucero's driver's license and then told him that I wanted him to find out whatever he could about Lucero. 

A week later I got a call from the PI and he told me that he had what I wanted. I dropped by his office and got the report. The over four months that Lucero hadn't called Shay to ask if she was ready to come back to him were because he was in jail. He did ninety days for something to do with marijuana and when he got out he got into a fight in a bar and got another thirty days. 

He wasn't working. He couldn't hold a job because he was incapable of taking orders from his bosses and he kept getting fired. I had been right in my assumption that he was unstable and I decided that I needed a permanent solution to the Todd Lucero problem. It cost me a few bucks and a few favors and a few favors called in, but the job got done. 

Following a phone tip the cops pulled Lucero over and a search of his vehicle found enough grass and cocaine that he went down for possession with intent to distribute. As a bonus he got in a fight with the cops that pulled him over and that got him additional charges. In jail he got into a fight with another prisoner and ended up breaking the arm of one of the cops that tried to break up the fight and that got him even more time. I smiled knowing that if he kept it up he would never get out. 

I never shared any of this with Shay and just let her think that he had given up on her and had left town. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Shay and I married and I received a surprise at the party following the ceremony. Shay had issued a blanket invitation to all of the girls she worked with never for one minute thinking that Gloria would come, but she did. The party had been going on for an hour when Gloria walked up to where Shay and I were sitting and asked Shay if she would mind if she danced with the bridegroom. Shay said "Enjoy" without batting an eye. I more than likely would have said "No thanks" if I would have been sitting there without Shay or if I would have spoken up before Shay, but it was Shay's night and if she was okay with it I wasn't going to do anything to spoil the night. 

I got up and walked out onto the dance floor with Gloria and as we positioned ourselves for the slow waltz – me being a touch on the stiff side – Gloria said: 

"Don't be pissed at me Frank, but I had to do this. It has taken me forever to work up the nerve to face you. I need to apologize to you for my actions. I never did talk to you after that day when you walked in on me and Barry. Too happy at first and then too ashamed later." 

"Too happy?" 

Just then the music stopped and Gloria asked if we could go off to the side and talk. I have to admit that the "Too happy" remark had made me curious so I walked Gloria back to where Shay was sitting and told her that Gloria and I were going to find a quiet place to talk. Shay smiled and told Gloria: 

"Just make damned sure that you bring him back." 

We went outside on the patio, sat down on a bench and Gloria said: 

"You did nothing wrong Frank. You were a marvelous husband and I really did care for you, but you were not my first choice. I never told you about Barry. No reason to because he was in my past, but to understand what I did to you you have to know that past. 

"Barry was my soul mate. It may sound corny, but to me our love was written in the stars. Barry was my everything. He could do no wrong. We were fated to grow old together. I'm serious Frank. Every atom in my body ached for the man. We were together from the seventh grade on. We planned on being married when we finished college. We graduated and Barry was offered a job in Los Angeles. I'd been to L.A. and I hated the place. I told Barry and told him that we wouldn't be happy there. He looked me right in the eye and told me that he was going. With me or without me, he was going and then he walked away from me. Just that quick. Less than a five minute talk and he got up and walked away leaving me sitting at the table in the restaurant. 

"I was more than upset. I was steaming and I wouldn't talk to him for a week and then when I felt that I had punished him enough I called him only to find out he had already left for California. I was crushed. My other half, the yin to my yang had walked off and left me. I was crushed. I don't know if you have ever had a love like that Frank, but I was left with a completely empty feeling. I was dead inside. It took me a while to get over it and come out of my shell. 

"Then I met you and fell in love with you. I honestly did fall in love with you Frank, but it wasn't the bone deep love that I had felt for Barry. I was happy in our marriage Frank; I really was, but then Barry came back and called me. He told me that he had come to realize that he wasn't complete without me. I'm ashamed to tell you that I didn't once think of you Frank. My Barry was back. My Barry was back and he wanted me. When you caught us it was our first time since he had come back. 

"When you ordered me out of the house my mindset was "I'm free to go to my love" and I left the house without a word. Unfortunately, while Barry was gone he had changed. Or maybe not. Maybe he was always that way, but I was too blinded by my love to see it. Whatever. When I left the house I moved in with Barry and within three months I was saying to myself "I gave up Frank for this?" It was a classic case of "Be careful what you ask for because you might just get it." 

"For what it is worth Frank I have missed you and I've missed what we had, but I also realize that the blame for losing both rests squarely on me. None of it was your fault Frank. You did nothing wrong. You were the kind of husband that most girls search for and never find and I had it and I threw it away." 

She stood up and said, "Thanks for letting me get that off my chest." She bent and kissed me and then walked away. I watched he walk away and then I got up and rejoined my new bride. 

"What was that all about" Shay asked. 

I told her what Gloria had said and then I said, "I guess she felt like she needed some sort of closure." 

"How about you? Did you need closure?" 

"No. I had my closure when I told her to get out of the house." 

"Come on sweetie; give the girl a little credit. It took some guts for her to do that." 

"So what? So now she feels a little better? That doesn't change the fact that she ripped my guts out when she did what she did with Barry and left me to live with the pain and self doubts. First Glenda and then Gloria? I spent one hell of a lot of time asking myself what was wrong with me because of that. Her saying "Sorry" doesn't erase any of that from my life. None of it has instantly disappeared from my memory because she said she was sorry." 

"You're right. Forget I mentioned it. Now, since it is our party, you need to get me out onto the dance floor." 

I met the girls that Shay played cards with at the party and I commented to Shay on one of them. Her name was Mary and besides being a sorority sister she also worked at Apex. Mary was pregnant and at seven months pregnant she looked like sex personified. I didn't doubt for one second that the room wasn't full of men with hard ons after seeing her and yes, that included me. I mentioned it to Shay and she smiled and said: 

"She certainly does have that effect doesn't she?" 

It was a remark that would come back to haunt me. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next five years were the happiest of my life. We spent those years going places and doing things and then one day Shay said: 

"It is time for me to be a mommy. Are you up for it?" 

"When have I not been up for you?" 

"Right thing to say sweetie, but what do you think?" 

"I've just been waiting for you to say that you were ready." 

"Okay then. The pills go into the trash today and we will start working on making it happen." 

Two months later over dinner Shay said, "Guess what happened today?" 

"You won the lottery?" 

"Close. I saw the doctor today. The rabbit died. You are going to be a daddy." 

Shay had always been gorgeous, but a pregnant Shay positively glowed and looked sexier than ever. I couldn't keep my hands off of her and our sex life jumped from three or four times a week to almost daily and often more than once. 

That 'glowing sexuality' is what caused what happened next. 

Unless she was out of town doing an audit Shay usually beat me home. It was a Tuesday and Shay was in her seventh month. I came home to find her sitting at the kitchen table going over some papers. She didn't smile at me when I walked into the room. She pointed at the chair opposite her and said: 

"You need to sit down Frank. We need to talk." 

Sensing that it was something really serious I said nothing and sat down. I looked at her and she said: 

"I've tried to think of a way to soften this, but I can't think of a thing so I'm just going to have to put it out there. I've done a really stupid thing and it can't be undone. I'll leave it to you to get the divorce. There won't be any alimony and only minimal child support and only while I'm of work on maternity leave. We will have shared custody of the child. I'll move into one of the spare bedrooms until I can find a place." 

"Divorce? What the fuck are you talking about?" 

"I told you Frank. I did a stupid thing and it has bitten me on the ass. I'm just trying to make things as easy as I can now rather than wait for you to throw me out." 

"Will you please just cut out the shit and tell me what the fuck is going on here?" 

When she finally started telling me the story it shocked me. It started years ago at one of her card nights. The girls let their hair down and shared things with each other that they would never tell anyone else. One of the girls, Mary, told the rest of the girls about something that she had done. She had always wondered what sex with a black man would be like. She had heard so much about their size and stamina that she had always wondered if any of it was true. 

"I was already pregnant so I didn't have to worry about condoms or condom breakage so when Travon, a black man who worked over in Asset Management, made a pass at me I decided to satisfy my curiosity. One time and no one would ever know right?" 

One of the other girls, Nancy, said, "Travon made a pass at you? You are six months pregnant girl." 

"He told me that pregnant I was still sexier than two thirds of the other girls he knew." 

"Did you do it?" Beth Ann asked 

"I did. Dave (her husband) was out of town on business so I took Travon home with me." 

"And?" 

"And what?" 

"Was any of it true? The size and stamina thing?" 

Mary had laughed and had said, "I'm not telling. All I'm going to say is that for the three nights Dave was gone Travon was in my bed." 

"Are you still seeing him?" 

"No. I satisfied my curiosity. No one for me but Dave any more." 

I shook my head at that. Mary had seemed like a sweet and innocent girl to me when I met her at our reception. I did remember commenting on her sexuality. 

"So what has any of that to do with this divorce stuff?" 

"Remember those Wednesday nights when I came home from my card game and damned near fucked you to death?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"It was because I was so turned on by what Mary was telling us. The pure wickedness of it was exciting to think about. A married woman, six months pregnant, fucking a black man just to satisfy a curiosity. I imagined his black body on top of her pregnant white body and it made my juices flow." 

"So it made you want to try a black man? 

"No. No it didn't. At least not then." 

"But you have since? Is that what this is all about? You found yourself a black lover and you are dumping me for him?" 

"Good God no! There is no way that I would ever leave you for another man." 

"Then what is this all about?" 

"Curiosity." 

"Curiosity?" 

"I was pregnant and Travon started making passes at me. You need to understand this part Frank. I know that you are always telling me how sexy I am pregnant, but you love me and you are going to say things that you feel will make me feel good. But that doesn't mean that I take you seriously. You say you see a sexy wife, but when I look into the mirror I see a bloated whale so when another man starts telling me I look sexy I eat it up. 

"Three weeks ago when I was in Baltimore to do the audit Travon was part of the team that I went with. We were there for three days and the entire time Travon was telling me how sexy I was and how much I was turning him on. And I admit that when he started coming on to me I remembered what Mary talked about on our card nights and I got curious about the same things she was curious about. Over those three days in Baltimore that curiosity built up. The last night we were there I convinced myself that I wouldn't hurt you or us if I satisfied that curiosity because it would be a one time thing and you would never know. 

I went up to Travon's room with him. I let him undress me. I let him suck on my breasts and then I watched him undress. He cock was hard when he got naked and he walked over to me, took my hand and put it on his cock and I started stroking it. He put his hands on my shoulders and started to push me down so I could take him in my mouth. I started to go to my knees and about halfway down a voice in my head screamed out: 

"What the fuck are you doing?!!!!" 

I straightened up, told Travon that I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't cheat on you and I started to dress. He tried to stop me and I kneed him in the balls, finished dressing and got the hell out of his room." 

"Well I didn't know until you just told me. The question is why? Why tell me now?" 

"Because I owe it to you to get it from me and not from somebody else." 

"Who else knows besides you and this Travon character?" 

"I don't know that any one else knows. I haven't told any one; not even my sorority sisters." 

"Then why did you think that you had to tell me? Who was going to blow the whistle on you?" 

"Travon. The asshole had a camera set up somewhere in his room. He came to me yesterday and told me that I had hurt him when I kneed him and that I had to kiss it and make it better. I told him to fuck off and die and then he said I'd better do it or he would send you the tape he made. I told him bullshit and he showed me some video captures that he had. They were pretty explicit. One showed both of us naked with my right breast in his mouth and one showed me with my hand on his cock. He said besides you he was going to see that copies were passed around at work." 

"So what are you going to do?" 

"I told him you were going out of town over the weekend so I would see him Friday." 

"Why Friday? I'm not going to be out of town so what does that have to do with it?" 

"It has to be Friday. If I do it Wednesday or Thursday he would be missed when he didn't show up at work or call in. Someone might get curious and go check on him. If I do it Friday no one will miss him until Monday or Tuesday." 

"Miss him?" 

"I intend to cut his cock off and watch him bleed to death. I'll use Saturday and Sunday to go through his place and find any hidden cameras and any film I can find. I figure that if he filmed me he filmed others. I'll take mine and leave the others. When the police find the body and the film of the other women those women and their significant others will be who the police investigate. It is a gamble and I know it, but the asshole picked the wrong woman to try and blackmail." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When Travon opened his door Friday evening and saw Shayleen standing there his face lit up in a big smile. It only lasted a few seconds though. The pepper spray she shot into his face wiped the grin away and as his flew to his face I stepped from the side of the door frame where I couldn't be seen if he looked through the door peep hole and moved into the room. His hands were still rubbing his eyes when I buried my fist into his stomach. It took the wind out of him and made it easier to handle him. 

I moved him into his kitchen, sat him down on a chair and then used zip ties to secure him to it. Shay got some towels and a wash rag and cleaned his face and then sat down across from him. I just looked at him and waited. Finally he said: 

"Who are you? What do you want?" 

"I'm Shayleen's husband and what I want is to cause you some extreme pain for the pain you caused me." 

"How the fuck did I cause you pain? I don't even know your ass." 

"You fucked up my happy marriage and now you have to pay for it." 

"Bullshit! It wasn't me. She was willing. All I did was offer her what she wanted. I didn't chase after her." 

"Sure you did. When it came time to fish or cut bait she said no, but you just had to come after her. That was your big mistake. The thing about blackmail is that it doesn't work unless the person you are trying to blackmail cooperates. In this case Shayleen isn't cooperating. You threatened to tell me and she said "Fuck it" and told me herself. Even though she didn't go through with it the fact that she started out to do it probably will have a major impact on our marriage. A marriage that I was extremely happy with until I found out about that trip to Baltimore. 

"The thing is, I would never have know if you would have just accepted that no means no and had left Shayleen alone. But you didn't leave her alone so here I am. In a way you should be glad that I'm here. Shay's original plan was to show up here tonight, cut your cock off and then watch you bleed to death. I couldn't let her do that although I do think it would be a fitting punishment for you. But I don't want my child to be born in a prison hospital. However, I can't see letting you off Scott free so I talked Shay into going along with my plan. 

"It would embarrass me no end to have pictures of Shay showing up anywhere. People would be looking at me and thinking things like "You poor boob. Being married to a slut like that." I don't want stuff like that to happen so my solution to the problem is to get the material in question. All of it. The originals, any copies you may have made. Sounds simple right? The problem here is that I don't trust you. You could say that I have it all even though you have other copies stashed somewhere or maybe even a duplicate tape. So what I am going to do is adapt Shay's original idea." 

I opened up the tool box that I had brought with me and took out a pair of bolt cutters. I held them up in front of his face and then said: 

"I'm going to start with the little toe on your left foot and then work my way across until I get to the little toe on your right foot. Next will be the fingers on the left had followed by the fingers on the right. Hopefully, before I get to the point of putting out your eyes you will have given me what I want. What I want is the location of every camera in this place. The location of every recording device in this place and the location of all the material that you have. Video, still, digital or whatever, I want it all." 

I opened the jaws of the bolt cutters and placed them around his little toe and said, "Start talking." 

He sneered at me, laughed and said, "Who the fuck you think you are kidding." 

I nodded at Shay and she covered his mouth with a towel to muffle the scream and I cut off his little toe. I gave it a minute and then I nodded at Shay and she removed the towel. He was blubbering and moaning: 

"Oh fuck! Oh Jesus! You did it! You fucking did it! It fucking hurts. Stop the bleeding man; stop the fucking bleeding." 

"Forget that toe Travon; it is gone and it isn't coming back."  

===

I moved the bolt cutters to the next toe and said, "Okay; let's try this again. Talk to me Travon; talk to me" and talk he did. While Shay bandaged his toe I went looking and found everything right where he said it would be. We collected all the cameras and recorders and behind a false wall in a closet we found all of the blackmail material. Shay raised an eyebrow as she looked at some of it. 

"Travon has been a very busy boy. If this material falls into the wrong hands he would be in big trouble." 

"How so?" 

His bosses wife AND his bosses daughter. My bosses wife and a half dozen other women who work at Apex. God help Travon if the husbands of these women were to see this stuff." 

The conversation took place in front of Travon and I looked him in the eye and said: 

"Here is the way it plays Travon. If the police show up at our place asking questions about what went on here tonight we will make all of this material available to the husbands, boyfriends, fathers and brothers of these women. Just accept that you fucked up and tried your shit on the wrong woman and write it off as a learning experience." 

I told Shay to take all the stuff out and put it in the trunk of the car and when she was gone I cut Travon loose from the chair and said: 

"One more thing. I didn't want to say this in front of Shay, but if I hear that you ever try anything with her again I promise you that they will never find your body. Take care and have a nice weekend" and I walked out of his place and joined Shayleen in the car. 

To be continued.  

===

Shay was silent for most of the ride home. About five minutes from the house she said: 

"Did you really mean it when you said what happened is going to have a major impact on our marriage? I didn't do it. I stopped. I didn't go through with it Frank." 

"You didn't go through with it, but you intended to. You willingly went to his room intending to do it. You got naked for him because you were going to do it. You took his cock in your hand and stroked it because you fully intended to do it. You fully intended to take another man into the body that already contained my child." I hesitated and then asked: 

"It is my child isn't it?" 

Her face went ghostly pale, but before she could say anything I went on. 

"The fact that you did not go through with it does not erase any of it." 

"What are you going to do?" 

"I don't know Shayleen. I honestly do not know. Glenda cheated, Gloria cheated and you were going to cheat. I can't help but believe that I would be better off without a woman in my life. I do know that if you weren't pregnant with what I hope is my child I would already be gone." 

"That's not fair Frank. I didn't do it. I stopped. I said this is wrong and I can't do it and I stopped." 

"That time. But what about the next time you are away from home doing an audit and decide that I'll never know?" 

"Damn it Frank; you know I'll never do it again. The same thing that stopped me with Travon will keep me from doing it again. The important thing is that I stopped Frank. I realized that it wouldn't be worth losing you and I stopped. And what is with the doubt that the baby is yours? You know damned well that it is." 

"Do I? I don't have the same level of trust in you now that I had last week. I don't know that you haven't been doing stuff like this on all your trips and the only reason this one is out in the open is that Travon got stupid." 

"I guess I asked for that attitude by being stupid and doing something that I should have known not to do, but I've never done it before and I didn't do it this time. I didn't do it Frank. I swear to god I didn't do it. I stopped. I said it wasn't worth it and I didn't do it." 

"Let me put it in a way that may help you understand. If I walk into a bank and stick a gun in a tellers face and tell her to give me all the money and while she is taking the money out of the drawer I suddenly say "This isn't right. I can't do it" and I turn around and leave the bank. Would the police not come after me because I changed my mind and didn't rob the bank? You know damned well that they would be after me. I might not have robbed the bank, but I had intended to so I would still have gone down for attempted robbery. 

"In your case you did not engage in adultery, but you damned sure intended to. You can say you didn't do it all you want to, but you went into Travon's room with the full intention of cheating. Adultery isn't a crime, at least not in this state, so no cops are going to come after you and punish you by sticking you in jail. No; your punishment gets left up to me. It may sound like a stupid analogy to you, but that is the way I see it and unfortunately for you the way I see it is what counts with me." 

"I love you Frank. That's why I couldn't go through with it. That's why I could never do it again. That has to count for something Frank. The fact that I love you has to count for something/" 

"Maybe it will Shayleen. I just don't know right now." 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day I took a half a day off work and went home at one. I needed some time to myself to think about my situation with Shayleen. The first thing I had to know was just how honest had Shayleen been with me. The material that we had taken from Travon's place was still locked in the trunk of the car and I took it all into the house. 

Travon has labeled everything so I had no trouble in finding the disc that Shayleen was on. I put the disc in the player and watched it. Shayleen had been mostly truthful, but only mostly. Things played out as she had described up to the point where she said that she had broken away. According to her story she bolted when Travon started to push her down to her knees. 

On the screen I watched as Travon gently push her down to her knees in front of him and then I watched as she leaned forward and started to suck his cock. I watched as her hands gripped his ass and pulled him to her and I watched as she deep throated him. It was at that point that she had her sudden change of heart. She pulled off him and he said: 

"The bedroom is back there" and he pointed. 

"I'm sorry, but I can't do this. I love my husband and I can't do this to him. I thought I could, but I can't." 

She reached for her clothes and Travon said, "Oh no you don't" as he grabbed her arm. "You got me started and you will damned well get me off. Pussy, mouth or ass; I don't care which, but you aren't leaving until you finish what you started." 

"Let go of my arm." 

Travon started to pull her to the bedroom and that is when she kneed him in the stones. He let go of her and she stepped back and kicked him in the crotch and as he doubled up she yelled at him: 

"No means no asshole." 

She dressed and by the time she had her shoes on Travon had somewhat recovered and he tried to stop her and she kicked him in the nuts again only this time she had her pointy toed high heels on and he screamed, grabbed his package and fell to the floor. 

"Fuckhead" Shay muttered and then she left. 

Then curiosity got the best of me and since I had worked at Apex and knew a lot of the people who worked there I looked at the other discs. It was eye opening to see women who I knew were married bouncing around on Travon's bed. 

It was apparent to me that several of then (not all) were being blackmailed and were on his bed reluctantly and it gave me an idea. I was pissed over what Shay had done and even more pissed that she had lied to me even when she confessed, but I did love the stupid cunt and it did appear that she loved me. 

I decided that even though she hadn't gone all the way with Travon that I had to do something to make her hurt. I had to do something to show her just how much her betrayal had affected me. And make no mistake here; she did betray me. True, she didn't go through with it, but to me the intent was the betrayal. 

Looking at the pile of material I had taken from the trunk of the car I had the germ of an idea. I put everything back in the trunk and then went upstairs to the guest bedroom to take a nap. I'd moved into the guest bedroom the night Shay had confessed to me. Shay wasn't happy about it, but I flat told her I wasn't in the mood to have her touching me even fully clothed so having her roll over and snuggle up next to me while sleeping just wasn't going to happen. 

I set the alarm to wake me a half hour before Shay was due to get home. When the alarm went off I got up and drove to the Waffle House and had a cup of coffee and a piece of pecan pie. I killed time until it was my normal time to go home. I didn't want Shay to know that I'd been home early and had a chance to look at the material in the trunk. 

She was there when I got home and I told her to have a seat at the kitchen table and then I sat down across from her. 

"I spent most of the day thinking about what to do. On the one hand I want to call the lawyers and get things over with, but on the other hand I want to be a full time father to my child and a divorce would prevent that. The problem with that is that there isn't any way I could live with you and sleep in separate rooms until the child has grown up or gone out on its own. For us to try and put things back together I need what these days they are calling closure. What I call it is punishment or maybe even revenge. 

"To put it bluntly I need to hurt you. I am incapable of harming you physically, but I still need to cause you some pain and I believe that I have come up with a way to do it. You are free to refuse to do it, but know that the refusal ends any chance for us to try and repair the mess you caused." 

"I'll do what ever I have to do Frank." 

"We will see Shay. What you have to do is go out to the car, get all the material and bring it into the house. You will destroy the material he had on you. I do not wish to see it. Not ever. Them you will go through the material and make a list of every one he had material on. Once we have that list you will go to each of those women, give them the material that Travon had on them and tell them that they are free of him if they chose to be." 

"If they choose to be?" 

"There is always the possibility that not all of them are being blackmailed. Hell! There is even the possibility that none of them are being blackmailed. If they ask where you got the material, and they most likely will, you will tell them that he tried to blackmail you and that you told me and that prompted me to go and have a "Come to Jesus" session with him and that meeting led to my recovering the material. Then you will ask them to call me and verify that you did actually see them and give them their package." 

"I can't do that Frank. What will they think of me?" 

"The ones being blackmailed will think that you were just as stupid as they were when they got involved with the asshole, but they will be happy to know that he no longer is holding a sword over their heads. The ones not being blackmailed will be embarrassed that you know what they have been doing. They will probably be unhappy to know that there were tapes and DVDs of their activities in existence, but glad that you told them and gave them what there was." 

"Damn it Frank; I have to work with those people. How can I face them every day after doing what you want?" 

"Not my problem Shayleen, but if you want any chance at all of making a life with me is what you will have to do." 

"Please Frank; don't make me do it." 

"I'm not making you do anything Shayleen. What ever happens it is strictly your choice." 

I stood up and said, "I'm going to the bar, drink some beer and shoot some pool to give you some time to think about it" and I left. Shay was in bed when I got home so I went into my room and sacked out. 

Shayleen was up and had the coffee made when I came down in the morning and as I poured my self a cup to go Shayleen said: 

"I thought long and hard on it Frank and I just can't do it." 

"So much for your statement that you would do whatever you had to do, but no problem. Your choice. Just remember that I gave you a chance and you turned it down." 

It was a busy day for me at work and I didn't think about my marriage problem until about three. Things slacked off a bit and I was able to give some thought to my situation. I didn't really like what I came up with, but a wise man once said "What is is." 

Shay had dinner ready when I got home and we ate in silence. Once the meal was over and the dishes were in the dishwasher I asked Shayleen to sit down and when she did I slid some papers over to her. 

"What is it" she asked. 

"A couple of things. The top sheet is how we will split things up around here. It outlines what each of us will do. It lists how our money will be handled and how the household duties will be split." 

"How our money will be handled?" 

"That's the second sheet. It outlines the cost of running the household. I will set up three new accounts at the bank. One will be called the household account and each of us will deposit half of the monthly total amount into the account and all the household expenses will be paid from that account. 

"The second account will be a savings account in the baby's name and we will each deposit ten percent of our take home pay into it. The third account will be a savings account in my name only. I will take half of what is in our joint savings account and put it in my new account and then have the name changed on the joint account to your name only. 

"The third sheet is a post nuptial agreement that states that we each can indulge in extra marital sex without the fear of being accused of adultery, but with the stipulation that said extra marital sex can not take place in the family home." 

"I won't sign that!" 

"I've allowed for that. The fourth sheet is also a post nuptial agreement. It states that if either party cheats on the other the cheater gives up all rights to full custody of the child and agrees to a 70/30 split of assets with the aggrieved party receiving the seventy percent." 

"I won't sign that one either." 

"In other words you are telling me that you plan to cheat again. It figures." 

I got up and walked away from the table and I was heading up the steps to the bedrooms when I heard her tearing up the papers. I expected as much but it was a way for me to show her that our marriage now existed in name only. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next two weeks went by with Shayleen and I just co-existing in the house. She made several attempts to entice me into having sexual relations with her, but I wouldn't give in. When she tried again on Friday night I told her to give it up. 

"I gave you a chance to try and work on saving our marriage and you refused. As a result we have no marriage any more. All we have is a roommate situation and that is all it is ever going to be. I will give you ne more chance to do what I told you that you had to do. I'll give you until Sunday evening to change your mind, but after that the choice will no longer be yours." 

"What does that mean?" 

"Just what I said. You have a chance to change your mind, but after Sunday you will no longer have that chance." 

"I've already told you Frank. I am not going to do it." 

I shrugged and walked away from her. 

Monday I showed up at Apex at lunch time and Shayleen looked on in horror as I took Melody Schaefer to lunch. Melody was embarrassed as hell that I knew what she had done, but she was overjoyed to find out that Travon no longer had the means to make her meet him at a motel. She gave me a great big hug and a kiss when I took her back to work and I wished her and her hubby well before going back to my office. 

That evening I was two hours late getting home from work and Shayleen was pissed because she had dinner ready and I was a no call no show. 

"Where the hell have you been?" 

"Having cocktails with Helen Deavers. I could have been gone longer because she offered to go to a motel with me and fuck my socks off for freeing her from Travon. I turned her down though. Tomorrow I'm having lunch with Dolores Hart and I'll be meeting with your sorority sister Mary for drinks after work." 

"My God frank. They know about me?" 

"Of course. I had to tell them how I came to be in possession of the material." 

"In that case I might as well take care of the rest of them." 

"Sorry Shayleen; you had your chance. I told you that come Monday the choice would no longer be yours." 

"That's not fair Frank." 

"Maybe, but the whole idea behind my telling you what you had to do to get us to where we could try and salvage our marriage was to see just how bad you wanted that to happen. Did you want it bad enough that you would be willing to do something hard and distasteful and the answer was no. You chose how others would look at you at work over trying to save your marriage. Now you get to live with that choice. 

"I'm doing what you wouldn't do because those women need to know that they are free of Travon if that is what they want. You could have been the one to set them free and if you had done it do you really think that they would have looked down at you? Hell no! You would have had a friend for life. Even the ones who were doing it willingly would thank you for letting them know they were being filmed. What woman messing around on her husband wants evidence of what she is doing out there that might come to light some day? 

"No Shayleen; nothing but good would have come out of your doing it. You chose what people at work would think of you over a chance to save your marriage and now you get to live with that choice." 

She started crying and ran from the room. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

By Friday I'd met with the nine women on the list that I knew who they were. There were four more who apparently didn't work for Apex and I had no way of knowing how to get in touch with them. Of the nine I talked with six were being blackmailed and all six were overjoyed to be free of Travon. 

One was seeing Travon with her husband's knowledge, one was seeing him willingly because her husband had erectile dysfunction and hadn't been able to get it up for two years. He didn't know and she didn't want him to ever know. The third told me flat out that black cock was her major turn on and she was not only doing Travon, but a couple of others also. 

All of them were horrified to find out they had been filmed and all were very grateful to me for not only brining it to their attention, but for giving them what I'd taken from Travon. I had more offers of pussy that week than I'd ever had before in my life. I hoped that the day would never come when I would regret turning it all down. 

There was one unforeseen outcome from my seeing all of the ladies. Marge Bowman, the woman whose husband knew she was sleeping with Travon, was the wife of Travon's boss. When she told hubby about Travon filming their meetings hubby fired Travon. He couldn't fire him for fucking his wife so what he did was put Travon's expense reports under a microscope and found enough irregularities to warrant caning Travon. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

On the home front I co-existed with Shayleen and she became more weepy and despondent as the days went by. She kept trying to get something going between us, but I wasn't having it. Some day maybe, but not any time soon. In my mind she hadn't suffered enough for what she had done. I may be going a little over the top, but it wasn't only the intent to hang horns on me; it was the lies she told. 

In her favor was the fact that she refused to be blackmailed and had come to me and confessed. But that very confession was what I was holding against her. That confession was three-quarters truth and one-quarter lies. The truth till she started to go to her knees and lies after that. She was confessing for god's sake so why not tell that last little bit and be done with it? If she had to lie about that what else was there that she was hiding? 

She came to me a week after I'd talked with the last woman on the list and told me that she couldn't take it any more. 

"I love you Frank and I want our marriage back the way it was. If you don't ever intend to try then we have to end it. I can not go on living this way." 

"I won't be the one to end it Shayleen. I will not knowingly deprive myself of being a full time father to my child. Assuming of course that it is my child." 

"Damn it Frank! It is your child!" 

"Maybe, maybe not. A DNA test when it is born will tell us. If it isn't mine then I'll get the divorce, but if it is mine any divorce will have to be on you." 

"God damn it Frank; the baby is yours. Why can't you believe that?" 

"The problem Shayleen is that I can no longer believe anything that you say." 

"Why not? When have I ever lied to you?" 

"The night you told me that Travon was trying to blackmail you." 

"I did not lie to you that night. I told you what happened. I told you what I did and why he was trying to blackmail me." 

"I was looking into your eyes when you told me that and I could see that you were lying to me. I wish now that I'd never told you to destroy the disc that Travon had of you. I wish now that I would have looked at it. If you could confess to what you did and still be lying there must have been something that you really felt the need to hide. Given that why would I believe anything that you say?" 

She was silent for maybe thirty seconds and then she said, "I didn't lie Frank; I just didn't tell the full story. I left out a part that I really didn't want you to hear."  

===

"So you did fuck him." 

"I did not! But I guess that I did lie at that. I told you that I pushed him away when he started pushing me down to my knees. That was the lie. What really happened was that he pushed me to my knees and I took his cock in my mouth. That was when I came to my senses and broke away from him. I didn't think you needed to know that. I thought that what I'd told you was bad enough and I didn't need to tell any more. You didn't need to think any worse of me than you were all ready going to. 

"But the baby is yours Frank. Doubt it or wonder about it all you want, but it is yours and I want you to be the baby's full time father as much as you want to be the full time father, but right now it is not looking too good for you Frank. I am not going to go on living the way we have been living. If you are not going to try and work with me to get by my stupid move then we need to end things. I'm well aware that it is all my fault and I understand your need to punish me for what I did, but I am not going to allow that punishment to last for the rest of my life. 

"Since my colossal blunder with Travon you have been big on offering me choices, but now I'm giving you one. Shit or get off the pot Frank. Either work with me to try and save what we had or flat out tell me that you are not going to. I'll give you until this time tomorrow to decide what you are going to do. If you are not going to work with me I'll be packed and out of here within twenty-four hours and I'll see a lawyer the next day. I won't be a bitch about visitation, but your desire to be a full time father will take a hit. I'd think hard on it if I were you." 

As she walked out of the room I was thinking "You should have known better Frank. You knew that Shay was no soft cream puff. You should have known you could only push her so far before she would get her back up." 

I wasn't really ready to let her off the hook, but it looked as if I wasn't going to be able to push it for as long as I had intended. But I still had a problem and a major one to my mind. If I caved too quickly to her ultimatum it could give her the idea that it was all she needed to do to get her way from now on. I couldn't have that. More to the point, I would not allow that. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I spent a good part of the next day thinking on the situation and what to do. There was no doubt in my mind that the baby was mine. I just kept throwing my doubt in her face to upset her and piss her off. And I did love her. Christ! I'd loved her when she didn't even know who I was when we were in school. There was never any intent in my mind to leave Shay. The hard line I was taking with her was strictly to make her suffer; to give me some satisfaction. Payback for the mental pain she had caused me. 

Because she wasn't seeing things from where I was sitting she didn't see our problem the way I saw it. As far as she was concerned what she started out to do was wrong, but then she didn't do it so no harm, no foul, get over it and let's move on. It would have been no harm, no foul if I hadn't learned of it, but I did learn of it and learning of it hurt. I hurt worse than Shay would let herself accept. By the time I locked the doors after that last employee had gone home I had a game plan. Whether or not it was a good one only time would tell. 

Shay was home and had dinner ready when I got home. We sat down to eat and it was a silent meal except for Shay asking me to pass the green beans. When we were done eating she got up, went to the sink, rinsed her dish and put it in the dishwasher. Then she leaned against the counter, looked at me and said: 

"Well?" 

"Well what?" 

"What did you decide?" 

"I haven't. For me to decide to try and make things work I need to decide whether it is even possible for things to ever work out. There are a lot of 'what ifs' and unanswered questions. Then there are attitudes that need to be dealt with and trust issues that need to be addressed.' 

"Attitudes? Trust issues? I don't understand." 

"Sure you do. Your attitude has been that you didn't actually do it so no harm, no foul, get over it and move on. That attitude is totally unacceptable to me. Then there is the issue of trust. Can I trust you not to do it again? If you think there is no way that I will ever find out will you once again try to see what a black man is like? You can say that there is no way that you will ever do it, but could I trust that you wouldn't? You travel at least once a month for three or four days doing audits. What will it do to me sitting here at home and wondering if you are behaving or being curious? And don't even tell me that I don't have to worry about it. Before I even proposed you knew how insecure I was because of what I went through with Glenda and Gloria. Now it is what I went through with Glenda, Gloria and you." 

"You aren't being fair frank. I didn't do it. I came to my senses and I didn't do it." 

"You see Shayleen? That is the problem. To you it is only important that you didn't do it. I don't see it that way. The way I see it is that you willingly went with Travon to his room with the intention of cheating on me. So what you say; I didn't go through with it. When you walked into his apartment and the door closed behind you did you say, "Sorry Travon; I can't go through with this. I love my husband and I can't do this to him" and then turn and leave? No you didn't. When he undressed did you say, "No Travon; I can't do this." No you didn't. When you were half undressed did you suddenly stop and say you couldn't do it, get dressed and leave. No you didn't. You didn't even stop when you had his cock in your hand and were stroking it. You didn't even stop when you opened your mouth and wrapped the lips that I used to love to kiss around his dick. You didn't stop until after you had sucked his cock for a minute or two. 

"To me you cheated on me when you went into his room with the intent to fuck him. That is the sticking point Shayleen. You weren't drunk and out of it or anything like that; you willingly and with intent went to his room with him and took him into your body. I know that I'm belaboring the point, but that is the point. You willingly did what you did and can I bring myself to believe that you won't do it again? 

"That is the roadblock Shayleen. That is what is keeping me from attempting to try and salvage our relationship. The fear that if the opportunity offers itself again you will do it. So you tell me Shayleen; how do I get my trust in you back? Just saying that you won't do it again because you love me and don't want to lose me ain't going to get it. You loved me and didn't want to lose me when you willingly went with Travon, but it didn't stop you until you had all ready gone way too far, at least in my estimation, so how are you going to save this marriage Shayleen? 

"Giving me twenty-four hours to shit or get off the pot isn't going to get us anywhere. It isn't me Shayleen; it is you. You made this mess so the question has to be what are you going to do to make me want to try and move forward with you? How are you going to make me believe that it will even be possible for things between us to work out? 

"Make no mistake here Shayleen; I do love you and I have wanted you since high school. I never even remotely considered that we could ever be together so having you marry me was the equivalent of dying and going to Heaven, but I can only be hurt so many times before I just flat give up. Glenda, Gloria, and you and Travon have done it Shayleen. I've been pushed to the edge and the next step will send me into the abyss. How are you going to make me believe that you won't cause me to take that last step? 

"Telling me to shit or get off the pot won't do it Shayleen. You are going to have to find someway to extend your hand to me in such a way that I will trust you enough to take it and let you pull me back from where I'm standing on the edge. I know that isn't the answer that you were looking for, but it is the best that I can offer. You, you Shayleen, have to make me believe that the marriage can be made to work again. You have to give me a reason to get up off the pot." 

I stood up and started for the garage to see if I could find something to keep my hands busy, but before I got to the door Shayleen said: 

"Where are you going? We are not done here." 

I turned and leaned on the door and looked at her. 

"You want a reason? How's this for one. When I told you about Todd you promised me that you would never leave me and that I was stuck with you for life. You promised! Is your word no good? How about your promise to keep me for better or worse when we said our vows? What I did was about as worse as it can get, but you promised. I know what you are going to say to that. You are going to throw my promise to hold only unto you in my face, but so what. So I'm not a good person. But you are and I have two promises from you and I'm holding you to them Frank. You told me that I was stuck with you for life and I'm god-damned well going to hold you to that promise. 

"I'll make you a promise now" and she placed her hand on her swollen belly and said: 

"I swear on my baby's life that I will never cheat on you and that I will be the best wife and mother you could ever hope for for the rest of our lives. So help me God!" 

I believed her. 

And now, eight years and three kids later I'm glad that I did.  

===

Love is something that I have a hard time understanding. Love is only an emotion right? So how can an emotion make you stupid? How can love cause you to do things that no man in his right mind would even consider? It was a little late for me to be asking the question. The damage has already been done. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

I met Stella in middle school. I started dating her in the ninth grade and we were going steady by the time we started tenth. We had an argument and broke up for a while, but were back together at the beginning of the eleventh. We broke up twice in the eleventh but we together at the start of the twelfth. 

While we were apart we dated others and it was that fact that always got us back together. I'd get pissed off and jealous whenever I saw her with anyone else and that was even if I was with another girl when I saw her. It was the same with her. She would get angry if she saw me with another girl even if she was with another guy. It usually led us to running into each other somewhere and the "How could you..." would start followed by "And just what were you..." and we would make up and be back together again. 

We celebrated our eighteenth birthdays a week apart and on the night of the senior prom we surrendered our virginities to each other. Following that night every time we found ourselves alone together the clothes would come off. 

We separated again after we graduated, but only because she went to Michigan State and I went to Eastern Michigan. We still got together on weekends and breaks and always the clothes would come off as often as we could make it happen. 

In our sophomore year I was at a party one weekend when Stella didn't come home and a couple of guys from our high school graduating class who were going to State asked me how in the world I could have been stupid enough to let a sex crazy girl like Stella go. I asked them what they meant and they told me that Stella was known as a "Three date fuck" and when I asked them what that meant they told me that if you made it to the third date with Stella you were sure to get some pussy. 

That of course was news to me because I thought that Stella and I were a couple and staying true to each other. When Phil and Ralph finished telling me about Stella I just said: 

"That's why I let her go. She just couldn't keep her legs together." 

Of course that was a lie because I had known no such thing, but I didn't want them thinking that I was a clueless twit where Stella was concerned. 

The following weekend she was home and I confronted her with my new found knowledge and she said: 

"So what? I like sex and you are here and not there. Besides, you don't own me. You haven't proposed and put a ring on my finger and it is your fault anyway." 

"My fault?" 

"Yeah Frankie; you took my cherry and got me used to having sex. What about you? You going to tell me that after all the loving we did and that you so obviously loved that you have been keeping your peter in your pants while I'm gone?" 

"Yes Stella; that is exactly what I'm going to tell you. I considered us a couple and there wasn't any way that I was going to cheat on you." 

"You wouldn't be cheating Frankie because we aren't an engaged couple. We are damned good friends who make love whenever we can and if you ask me to marry you I will say yes, but not until after we finish college. Until then I'm going to sow my wild oats and you should be doing the same. I'm all yours when I'm here at home, but as long as we are separated I'm going to date and you should also. Get curiosity out of your system before we get married and then we won't have to worry about that seven year itch that people talk about. Now – do you want to make love or waste more time talking?" 

I didn't know it at the time, but I made the first of several bad decisions where Stella was concerned. I decided that she was right and that I should do what she was doing and over the rest of the time we were in college I dated when Stella wasn't home and made love to Stella when she did come home. 

++++++++++++++++ 

I discovered a lot dating other girls. I found out that Helen Liss and Roberta Price both gave better head than Stella. Carol Wilder liked having sex where there was a possibility that we would be caught and while I was scared to death that we would be caught it was still one hell of an exciting turn on. 

Samantha Crown introduced me to anal sex and Beverly Holbrook took me to a gangbang where I shared her with six other guys. Nancy Neubert's big thing was to be pissed on after we were done fucking and Beverly Abbeg was into having threesomes with her best friend Pauline French. All in all I had to say that I had a very full and rewarding sex life when Stella wasn't around and I even caught myself wondering if I was going to be able to stay true to Stella when we got married. 

Stella never questioned me about what I did when she wasn't at home and even though I was aware that she was 'sowing her wild oats' while she was gone I never mentioned it. 

I was a little peeved over a few things. Things like when she first asked me to do her ass. That told me that someone else had already been there and that she liked it. She was my girl and I felt that I should have been the first to go there. Whatever. We somehow managed to get through those years and two months after we graduated we took our vows in front of eighty-three family and friends. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The first couple of years went by and I thought that Stella and I had a good solid marriage. Our sex life was very fulfilling as we both put what we learned while sowing our wild oats to use with each other. 

I talked Stella into trying sex in places where we might get caught and she loved it. She got me into trying some positions that I'd never tried before and I found that I especially liked reverse cowgirl and one that she called the rear leg lift. There was another thing that she wanted to do that I wasn't interested in. She wanted me to sit in the bath tub while she peed on me. Even though I had done it to Nancy Neubert I wasn't the least bit interested in having it done to me. No double standard here – Nancy wanted it so I obliged her, but I didn't want it so I said "No way!" In fact I said "No fucking way!" Stella didn't want to take no for an answer and she kept after me. 

"It turns me on something fierce Frankie. I don't know why, but I can sometimes cum when I do it. It won't hurt you and it does so much for me. Come on baby; that's what making love making is supposed to be all about – giving your partner pleasure. Don't I give you everything that you want? Come on Frankie; do it for me." 

"I notice that you aren't asking me to pee on you." 

"I don't like it. It doesn't do anything for me and from the way you are taking my asking you to do it to me I'm guessing that it won't do anything for you. Of course I'll do it if you want; just say the word. Please baby, let me do it to you. I get such a charge out of it." 

She was right in that making love was as much about giving your partner pleasure as it was about getting your own so eventually I gave in and let her do it. It wasn't all that bad and when she was done all I had to do was stand up and turn the shower on. She got in with me, scrubbed my back and then I took her from behind as she leaned against the wall. 

After that she peed on me about once a week always followed by me taking her as she lent against the wall. I never did get the urge to pee on her although once or twice I thought about telling her I wanted to do it just to see what she would say. I almost put a stop to it the night she asked me to let her pee in my mouth. 

"Absolutely not!" 

"Just one time so we can see what it is like." 

"You want to see what it is like then you get in the tub and I'll piss in your mouth." 

"I wouldn't like it, but I thought you might." 

"Why in the hell would you think that?" 

"You don't mind my peeing on you." 

"I only do it because you say it really turns you on, but I get nothing out of it." 

"If that's the case let me pee in your mouth and let me see if it turns me on just as much." 

"No Stella and I mean it. Take what you are getting and be satisfied with it." 

She never brought it up again. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

In our third year Stella came home from work one night and told me that she was signing up for a couple of night classes at EMU. 

"They are classes that will help me get a promotion and John (her boss) says that if I have them on my resume I'll be a sure thing to get Marsha's job when she leaves at the end of the year. They are on Tuesday and Thursday at six- thirty so you will be on your own as far as dinner is concerned because I'll go to school straight from work." 

"How long?" 

"Just one term and the best part is that the company will pay for it." 

She took the classes and got the promotion and things were fine for another year and then our life was disrupted again. One of the girls Stella had gone to school with at State moved into town and got in touch with Stella. Stella started stopping after work for drinks with Anna and she invited Anna and her husband over one Sunday for a barbecue. 

Have you ever met someone you took an instant dislike to? That was me with Anna. I hadn't yet heard the first word out of her mouth and I didn't like her. She was brassy and bossy and she treated her husband like he was her personal servant. All I heard from the poor bastard while he was there was "Yes dear," "Whatever you say dear" and "Here, let me do that for you." 

I couldn't even imagine what his life must be like living with Anna. But as much as I didn't want to be around Anna I knew I couldn't get away with telling Stella to keep her friend away from me so after they left when Stella asked me what I thought of them I just said, "They seem like a nice couple" and let it go at that. 

About two months later at another weekend barbecue my life took a drastic turn. I had turned the grill over to Dennis (Anna's husband) and had gone into the house to use the bathroom. The weather was mild and so the bathroom window was cracked open about eight inches and as I was shaking the last couple of drops off my dick Stella and Anna walked by the window and I heard Stella saying: 

"....won't matter because Frank is a clueless twit. I can..." and then they were out of range of my hearing and I didn't hear the rest of what Stella was saying. 

So I was a clueless twit was I? I wondered what other marvelous things my loving wife had to say about me. I stewed over it for a couple of days and then I finally did something I never would have thought I'd ever do. I went on the Internet and found out how to put a tap on my home telephone line. I wasn't looking to catch Stella being unfaithful because quite honestly that thought never entered my mind, but I did want to know what else Stella thought of me. 

Stella didn't leave for work until an hour after I did so that gave her time to talk without me being around and I bowled on Tuesday and attended my lodge meetings on Thursday (Fraternal Order of Eagles if anyone cares). That gave Stella ample time to be on the phone with me not being where I could over hear things. I put the tap in on Sunday while Stella was out grocery shopping and then waited to see what I would get. 

I didn't get a chance to listen to anything until Wednesday. Stella called me at work and told me that she would be a little late so when I got home I listened to what the recorder had picked up on Monday, Tuesday and that day. All I got from Monday's conversations was that Stella would be going over to Anna's house while I was bowling. 

"I'm looking forward to it" Stella said. 

"It will be a blast honey" Anna said, "And after you see it you are going to want to do it." 

"Got to go. Don't want to be late for work. I've got to make sure that I give John a good start to his day." 

Anna laughed and said, "You go you slut you." 

Things to wonder about. Anna calling my wife a slut? What did she know about my wife that I didn't? What was it that Stella was going to want to do after she saw it? And what the hell did "I've got to give John a good start to his day" mean. Tuesday morning's talk only told me that Stella and Barb (I've no idea who Barb was) would be to Anna's around six-thirty. Wednesday's take was a little more enlightening, but left me with even more questions. 

"I still don't believe it. I saw it, but I still don't believe it. When you ordered him to lick my feet and he didn't even hesitate to do it I just couldn't believe it. Barb and I both couldn't get over him bending over and letting you beat his ass with a whip without any protest at all. It was unreal. Men aren't supposed to be like that." 

"Dennis didn't used to be that way, but I trained him well. If you think last night was something wait until you see what I have him do Thursday night." 

"Give me a clue." 

"Just get your hubby fired up tonight and tomorrow morning. You are going to want him to jump your bones as soon as you get home and walk in the door Thursday night." 

I had no idea what it was that Stella was going to see Thursday night, but she followed Anna's advice and spent Wednesday night trying to fuck my brains out and then woke me up with a blow job Thursday morning. She stopped just short of getting me off and said: 

"I want you primed for me when I get home tonight." 

I had some things to do after work and she was home before me and when I got there she met me at the door in only high heels and thigh high nylons. 

"I hope you didn't tire yourself at work because tonight you have your work cut out for you." 

I've no idea what fired her up, but we made love three times that night which was highly unusual for us. We averaged three times a week and maybe twice on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night was the norm. It was Saturday before I could listen to Thursday and Friday's conversations. Stella was at the beauty parlor for her regularly scheduled hair work and I was able to listen to the recorder without her being around. 

There was nothing on Thursday except a conversation between Stella and Barb where Barb said she couldn't make it that night because her husband was making her go to some company function with him. 

"We need to learn more about how Anna does it and then we won't have to put up with men making us do anything." 

Our men making us do anything? I never made Stella do anything and in fact the opposite was true. She was always getting me to do things. 

Friday's first call was an eye opener and the first indication that Stella and I were in trouble. Barb called Stella to ask what had happened at Anna's the night before. 

"You thought Tuesday was wild? Last night was over the top compared to Tuesday. It would be like comparing first grade to grad school. I hadn't been there two minutes when the doorbell rang and Anna went to answer it. She came back with two guys named Eddie and Jared. She asked if the two of them were ready to do it and they both smiled and started to undress. Anna told Dennis to strip and he did and then we all went into the bedroom. 

"Anna laid down on the bed and Eddie got between her legs and then Anna told Dennis that he knew what to do. Dennis came over, took hold of Eddie's cock and guided it into Anna. Jared got on the bed and knelt next to Anna's head and she told Dennis to go sit on his chair. Dennis sat down on a chair next to the bed and played with himself as he watched Anna suck Jared while being fucked by Eddie. 

"When Eddie came she told Dennis to get to work and do his job. Dennis got on the bed and sucked Eddie's cum out of her. Then Jared moved in and Dennis guided him in like he had Eddie and then while Jared screwed Anna Dennis cleaned Eddie's cock with his mouth and worked at getting him up again. Jared came and Dennis cleaned him out of Anna and then Eddie got back on the bed and started screwing Anna again while Dennis cleaned Jared's dick and worked at getting him up again.'' 

"They each screwed Anna three times and Dennis did the clean up without any protest the first two times. The third time Eddie was in her pussy and Jared was in her butt. When Jared came Anna told Dennis to clean him up and Dennis finally refused. No way was he going to suck a shit covered dick is what he said. Anna ordered him to do it and told him that he knew what she would do to him if he didn't do what he was told and he started crying and ran from the room. Just after that I left so I don't know what she did to Dennis for disobeying her. Now all I have to do is figure out how I can get Frank to do something like that." 

"How are you going to do that?" 

"I've no idea, but I'm thinking on it." 

"Frank doesn't seem the type to do that." 

How would she know that? I didn't even know a Barb so how could she know what type I was? 

The next words told me what my wife thought about me. 

"Frank's the type all right. I boss him around all the time. I even make him get in the bath tub so I can piss on him." 

"That's nasty!" 

"What can I say? Being able to dominate him that way turns me on. Got to go if I'm going to get to work in time to start John's day off right." 

There it was again. What did she have to do to start her boss's day? 

I played golf on Saturday morning so there was a morning conversation between Anna and Stella and it was that conversation that changed our marriage. Stella told Anna that she was thinking of ways to get me to be like Dennis. 

"I don't know if you can Stel. Dennis is a born submissive and that is the reason I married him. I knew I could boss him around and make him do what ever I wanted. Frank doesn't strike me as the kind of guy who would willingly do what I make Dennis do." 

"I don't know how submissive Frank is, but I think I can make it happen. I told you that he lets me piss on him and I think that there is a little bit of the cuckold in him. He has to know that he is sucking another man's cum out of my pussy. I make sure that I have sex with him every time after John fucks me and our sex always starts out with Frank eating my pussy. He has to have noticed that I taste different after John makes love to me." 

"And he never mentions it to you?" 

"He did once, but I told him that it was probably some residue from the douche that I use." 

"He's that gullible?" 

"You bet. That's one of the reasons I married him. I knew I could control him when he bought my reasons for fucking other guys while we were at State. He even bought my story about my taking evening classes to get a promotion at work. It was true that I was using the time to get a promotion." 

"You never told me the story behind that." 

"John's wife was pregnant and wouldn't make love with him. He told me that if I would be his sexual outlet until she had the baby and was cleared to have sex again he told me that he would promote me and give me a nice sized raise. At first it was only supposed to be blow jobs, from there and we kept on doing it even after his wife had her baby. It has gotten to where I have to give John a blow job every morning to start his day out right and that's in addition to the long lunches we take." 

"And Frank hasn't a clue?" 

"I told you he was a clueless twit." 

"Well I guess you know him better than I do, but I would work up to it slowly. Very, very slowly." 

I had put in the tap because after hearing what I heard through the bathroom window I was curious about what else Stella had to say about me. Well, I certainly did find out. To her I was a clueless twit and a wimp that she thought she could turn into a subservient cuckold. She didn't have a chance in hell of making it happen and I was already working on a plan in my head that might make her think I could possibly go along with what she wanted. I would have to wait until she started her campaign to get me to be like Dennis, but she would be in for one hell of a huge surprise.  

===

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I wasn't at all surprised that she started on me Saturday after she got back from her hair appointment. 

"I'm super horny for some reason so how about a late dinner after we work up an appetite?" 

"Gee Stel; I don't know. Maybe if you twisted my arm or something like that." 

"Asshole" she said as she took my arm and led me to the bedroom. It started out the same as always. She started sucking my cock and after a couple of minutes I pulled her into a sixty-nine and after several minutes of mutual munching Stella moved into her favorite position, doggie, and I fucked her to an orgasm and then I had mine. She got up to use the bathroom and when she came back she sucked me hard again and then she told me that she wanted it in her butt. After we had both climaxed for the second time and were lying cuddled up she asked: 

"Are you happy with me frank?" 

"Very happy." 

"Do you ever feel you are sorry you married me because it cut you off from playing with other girls?" 

I knew instantly where the conversation was headed so I helped it along. 

"No, I'm not sorry that I married you; but I do confess that there are some other women I've had lustful thoughts about, but I've never acted on it. I wouldn't do anything that would jeopardize our marriage. Why he question?" 

"Promise me you won't hate me?" 

"I could never hate you and you should know that by now." 

"The reason I was super horny when I came home? It was because I saw one of the guys I had sex with in college and I remembered how exciting it was to have a different guy every once in a while. I just wondered if you had thoughts like that." 

"When you say you saw one of your old lovers were you saying that you met him and had sex with him?" 

"Oh no, nothing like that. I was early for my appointment so I went to the Starbucks just up the street. Kevin was there having coffee and we said hi and talked about what we had been doing since school. He asked me if would like to get together some night." 

"And you said?" 

"I said no of course. Like you I won't do anything that would put our marriage at risk." 

"I can tell from your tone of voice and the look on your face that you wanted to say yes." 

She looked away from me for a couple of seconds and then said, "You're right. I did want to say yes." 

"Correct me if I'm wrong here, but from the way this conversation started and your confession just now I'm getting the feeling that you would like to get a little strange now and then. Is that it?" 

She was silent for a bit and then said, "Yes. Seeing Kevin reminded me of how much I enjoyed making love with different guys. There is just something exciting about going to a new man and wondering how he will compare to others I've been with. Is he bigger or smaller? Does he have stamina? How good is he at this or that? It isn't about love or affection. It is all about sex." 

"Going with Kevin wouldn't be like that. You've already had him." 

"True, but have things changed with him over the years? It would be like going to a new man. You know; not knowing what you would find." 

"Be honest with me here Stel. If there was no way I could have ever found out would you have agreed to meet Kevin some night?" 

"Honestly?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"Yes; I would have, but only if there had been absolutely no way you could have ever found out." 

"That tells me that you would love to be able to sample other men as long as your marriage stayed safe. Am I right?" 

She looked at me and didn't say anything for several seconds and then she said: 

"If it didn't cost me you and our marriage." 

"Okay. We know where we stand. I haven't chased any of the women I have lusted after because I didn't want to risk losing you and our marriage and you haven't gotten together with other men for the same reason. What that all tells me is that we are in a situation that makes us prime candidates for what is called an open marriage." 

"An open marriage? What is that?" 

"Where we each have the other's permission to engage in sexual fun with others as long as it is open and above board and we always come home to each other." 

"You would do something like that?" 

"To be honest about it? Although there are several women who I fantasize about I would probably never act on it even if I had the chance." 

"You are saying that you wouldn't but I can?" 

"I'm saying that it isn't likely that I will, but you never know about things like that. But yes, you are free to do what you would like as long as you always come home to me." 

"Why on earth would you let me do it if you aren't?" 

"Because I love you and want to see you happy and also because I know you love me and that means I don't have to worry about it. There is a rule though. If you ever bring a lover home you have to call me ahead of time and let me know so I can decide on whether I want to stay home or go out." 

"Why would you stay home?" 

"I don't know that I would, but I've heard hat some men like to watch their wives have sex with other men. Who knows? I might just like it." 

"You really mean what you are saying?" 

I reached over and shoved a finger in her pussy and said, "Just thinking about it is getting me hard." 

Stella laughed and spread her legs. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Sunday I told Stella that I was going to be gone for a couple of hours looking for a new lawn mower at Home Depot or Lowe's. It was a fib. I just wanted to give her some time alone so she could call Anna or Barb. I already knew what I was going to do, but I needed to know as much about what Stella was going to do as I could find out and I was trusting my phone tap to get me the information. 

Sunday evening while Stella was in the shower I checked the phone tap. Stella had done just what I expected and had called Anna. 

"You are not going to believe it. I didn't even have to work for it. I told him a cock and bull story about running into Kevin Butler. I told him Kevin was one of the guys I'd had sex with in college." 

"Kevin Butler? Wasn't he the guy who had you pulling trains at the Phi Delta house?" 

"Oh yeah! Those were the days weren't they? Anyway I pulled that into a conversation about having thoughts about making it with other people and the twit came right out and proposed that we have an open marriage. Can you believe it? He was the one who brought it up. He even said he might watch." 

"What are you going to do?" 

"I'm going to bring a guy home and see what happens. If Frank watches and doesn't run screaming from the room I'll know that eventually I can turn him into a copy of Dennis." 

"Who are you going to do it with?" 

"At first I thought John, but then I decided it would be better to keep what John and I do separate. Do you think I could get Eddie to do it? He is quite a hunk and has a decent sized cock." 

"I'm sure he would. His big thing is fucking married women in front of their husbands. I'll put you in touch. When do you want to do it?" 

"Wednesday I think. Tomorrow would make Frank think I had already set it up before our talk and Tuesday he bowls. He might think Wednesday is quick, but I'll just tell him I wanted to do it before he changed his mind." 

"You do know that Eddie will trash talk in front of Frank right?" 

"Yeah and if Frank takes it I'll know I'm one step closer to making him into a Dennis clone." 

There it was. Wednesday would be the start and if I played my part right Stella would set herself up for the final act and hopefully it would be over in a week, two at most. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

That night in bed after we'd made love Stella said, "I need a super huge favor baby." 

"Name it my love." 

"There is a guy at work who has been hitting on me for age. I'd like him to be the first under this open marriage thing, but the thing is that I'm scared. I'm afraid that if I really do it you will throw me out. I really do need to know that you are okay with it." 

"So what's the favor?" 

"I want you to be here with me when I do it." 

"I told you I'm alright with it Stel." 

"I know you did, but I would feel a lot better if you were here." 

"I suppose I could do it, but what if this candidate of yours doesn't want to do you if I'm around?" 

"He's been after me for so long that I'm betting that he will go along with whatever I say." 

"I suppose that it will be as good a time as any to see if I'll like watching. When do you want to do it?" 

"You bowl on Tuesday so I'll try for Wednesday okay?" 

"I'll have to miss my lodge meeting, but keeping you happy is more important than that so I guess so." 

"Thank you baby" she said as she lowered her head to my cock to see if she could bring it to life again. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I got what I expected over dinner on Monday. 

"Eddie jumped at the chance to do me even if it is in front of you. He did ask whether you would be hiding in the closet or in the room with us." 

"In the room with you of course. In for a penny in for a pound. I'll put a chair off to the side where I can get a good view. If it turns out that watching you with another man isn't a turn on I can get up and leave." 

"I'm horny just thinking about it. Come on baby; let's go to the bedroom for desert." 

I couldn't get over how thinking that she was putting one over on me could make her so horny. Twice that night and again on Tuesday morning. As I was leaving for work she told me that she was going over to Anna's after work, but that she would be home by the time I got there. She didn't manage it and I got home first. I gambled that I had enough time to listen to Monday's and Tuesday conversations. 

All I got from Monday's take was that Anna had talked with Eddie and he was all for it. She gave Stella Eddie's number and said that he was expecting her call. Stella said she would call him when she got to work. Tuesday's call was another nail in Stella's coffin. 

"I talked to Eddie yesterday afternoon and we worked out the details for Wednesday night. He said he and Jared were going to see you tonight. How do you feel about sharing your toys?" 

"One or both?" 

"Both if you wouldn't mind." 

"I don't mind at all. For me it isn't the sex I get from them it's what I can do to Dennis that's the driver. If you want I can make Dennis eat you out after they fuck you. I love making him suck up another man's gunk." 

"That would be so cool. It would give me a taste on what I plan on having Frank do." 

There was a little more, but I'd heard enough. I was in bed when Stella got home and when she got in bed she went for my cock. 

"I need it baby. Go down on me and then fuck my eyes out." 

No way was I knowingly going to eat her pussy knowing that she had just fucked two guys and probably more than one time each, but not having sex with her when she offered might make her wonder and I didn't want that. I rolled over, moved on top of her and pushed my cock at her hole. It slipped in with no resistance and I said: 

"I guess you are hot. You are so hot and wet that I slipped right in." 

She moaned, "I'm always hot for you baby." 

Lying bitch I thought as I fucked her. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was up and out of the house before Stella woke up and I spent the day steeling myself for the evening. It wasn't going to be easy, but I was going to have to make myself behave like Stella wanted me to. I was going to have to watch her fuck some asshole and make like it turned me on. At some point I would have to take my dick out and stroke it while I watched. The hard part, actually the first of two hard parts, was going to be listening to this Eddie fuck-head trash talk me and not get up and wax his ass. The second hard part was going to be acting like I loved fucking Stella while her cunt was still full of Eddie's leavings. I'd have to do it though if I wanted my plan to work. 

That evening when I got home from work Stella had a light supper all ready on the table. She opened her house coat and said: 

"What do you think? Will this turn him on?" 

She was wearing some lingerie that I had never seen before. A cut-a-way bra, crotch less panties, garter belt, nylons and a pair of sexy strappy heels. 

"Any man it wouldn't turn on is already dead and waiting for burial" I said as I thought "You fucking bitch! You never dressed like that for me." 

Eddie arrived at seven and he smirked when Stella introduced us. Stella gave him a long passionate kiss and then said: 

"I can't wait. Let's get to the bedroom" and we all went there. 

My biggest surprise was that I did get turned on watching my unfaithful cunt of a wife fuck another man. I didn't have to fake sitting there and pretending. I did take out my cock and I did beat myself off as Stella sucked his cock, fucked him, sucked him hard again and then took him in her ass. All the time he fucked her Eddie was spouting off. 

"Don't you wish you could fuck her like this? Don't you wish you could make her scream like I'm making her scream? When was the last time she begged you to fuck her ass? Look at how she loves it. See her fucking back at me? She is one fine bitch and I'm going to fuck her a lot from now on. Face it dude, she's my bitch now ain't you Stel baby." 

"Oh yes; I'm yours, all yours, just don't stop. Fuck my ass lover, fuck my ass." 

It went on like that for three hours and then Stella called a halt to things. "I've got to get some rest before I go to work tomorrow." 

As Eddie dressed he looked me in the eye and said, "She's my bitch now and I'm going to fuck her whenever I want. Understand?" I looked down at the floor and shook my head yes and then got ready for bed as Stella walked him out. When Stella came back she was all smiles. 

"You liked it! I saw you watching and stroking yourself. You have to make love to me now. You just have to." She plopped down on the bed, spread her legs and said, "Come over here and eat me baby and then fuck my lights out." 

"I don't think so Stel. I don't think I'm quite ready yet to taste another man, but I will fuck you to see what it is like to have sloppy seconds." 

She ran a finger into her cunt, pulled it out and licked it. "It doesn't taste bad baby. Please?" 

"I don't know Stel; that's a pretty big step for me to take. Maybe I'd better ease into things. I mean I wasn't even sure that that I'd like watching." 

"Please baby, please? Do it for me." 

I hesitated and the said, "Maybe just a small taste" and I got down and ran a finger into her cunt, wiggled it around and then pulled it out. "Here goes nothing" I said as I brought my hand up to my mouth and sucked on my thumb which I had kept clear. 

"Not too bad" I said "But it is definitely going to be an acquired taste." 

"Oh baby; I do so love you" and she pulled me down on top of her. Sloppy seconds was no big thing to me as I'd had them before in college. My fraternity had a mattress room where some girls were known to pull trains. I'd never had them from my wife before though. I'd obviously followed others into her, but she must clean herself after she fucks John and Tuesday night she must have cleaned up at Anna's because even though I'd slid right into her she didn't feel like most sloppy seconds that I'd had. No matter. It would soon be over. 

She hadn't lied. She was horny. I fucked her, she sucked me hard and I pulled her into the doggie position and fucked her in the ass. She snuggled in next to me and as I was falling asleep I was thinking; 

"I'm going to miss the bitch." 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was Friday morning before I could listen to the phone intercepts. Wednesday's call was about what she had done Tuesday night and what she hoped for on Wednesday night. Eddie and Jared both fucked her and Anna had made Dennis eat Stella out after each one of them. Then she blew Eddie while Jared took her ass. Then Eddie took her ass while Dennis sucked Jared hard. As soon as Jared was hard Eddie and Stella changed positions so Jared and Eddie could fuck her in her cunt and ass at the same time. As for what she hoped to happen Wednesday night? It didn't happen. She wanted me to eat her after Eddie had left and she figured that if I would do that the next time she could get me to hold Eddie's cock and put it in her. 

Thursday's call was all about what had happened when Eddie was over. 

"He sat there and took Eddie's trash talk while watching us and beating his meat. He is going to be like Dennis before I'm done. I just know it. I couldn't get him to suck Eddie out of me, but he did stick a finger in me and then lick it. That's a first step I guess. Before it's over I'll have him sucking cum out of my ass just like Dennis did." 

"You'd better take it slow honey" Anna said. 

"I'm not worried. I told you he was clueless and now I know he's a wimp also. He actually sat there smiling and jerking off while Eddie was putting him down. No real man would have put up with that shit." 

There was more, but it was all the same and it left no doubt in my mind what my wife really thought of me. 

Friday night over dinner Stella asked me if we could do it again. 

"I suppose. Eddie again?" 

"Probably. He is a known quantity. Is it okay with you?" 

"If it keeps you happy my love." 

"You're the best rank. I don't know what it was that I did to deserve you, but you are the absolute best." 

We made love that night and I probably would every chance I got because I had no way of knowing when I'd get any after things were over. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Saturday and Sunday were quiet days and aside from playing golf Sunday morning I was mostly around the house and except for a couple of hours when she went grocery shopping Stella was home too. Monday while Stella was showering I listened to what was taped over the weekend. There was nothing on Saturday, but Sunday while I was out playing golf she talked to Anna. 

"He's okay with me doing it again so I'm going to set us up for Wednesday. This time I'm going to get him more involved." 

"What are you going to do?" 

"Try to get him to put Eddie's cock in me. If I can get him to do that I'll try to get him to suck Eddie out of me. I bet I can have Frank cleaning Eddie's cock with his mouth in three months." 

"You plan on making Eddie your steady lover?" 

"No, I was just using his name. I have no idea who I'll be screwing in three months. I do know I'm going to do Eddie Tuesday while Frank is bowling. I hope Eddie doesn't find out he will be getting sloppy seconds because I will do John sometime during the day." 

"You are a real slut aren't you." 

"I guess, but what the fuck Anna, I like it. I get a big charge out of fucking a guy and then letting Frank have some." 

"Be careful honey. You push too hard and you could end up losing Frank." 

"No way! He loves me and I have him wrapped around my little finger." 

Wrapped was I? Boy was she ever in for a surprise. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

That night she told me that she had set Eddie up for Wednesday and I decided that I should throw a little shit into the game. 

"I don't know Stel. Wednesday is my lodge meeting night and I missed last weeks for you." 

"Please Frank? I've already told him that Wednesday would work for us. Just this time. I won't do it on Wednesday anymore. I promise." 

"I'll think about it. I'll have to call Bob Morgan and see what I missed last Wednesday and if there is anything that will require me to be there this Wednesday." 

I saw the disappointment on her face and I would agree to do Wednesday, but I was going to make her sweat a bit first. I finished dinner and then went into the den and pretended to do some work that I'd brought home with me and after a while I pretended to make some phone calls. An hour and a half after I'd gone into the den I came out and told Stella that I would give her the coming Wednesday but to schedule her fun for other days from then on. She rewarded me with an exhausting night before we fell asleep.  

===

Tuesday when I came home from bowling Stella was waiting for me in my favorite outfit – naked except for 'CFM' pumps. I could tell I was getting sloppy seconds, but I acted as she expected me to – clueless. 

Wednesday over breakfast Stella said, "You do know that I love you right?" 

"Of course I do." 

"I love you so much that I would never do anything that would upset you, but I have a request that might upset you." 

"What is it?" 

"I want you to be an active part in what you are letting me do." 

"An active part? How?" 

"Eventually I would like you to eat Eddie out of me after the first time he does me to sort of get me ready for the next time, but I think you will need some time to build up to doing something like that. What I'd like you to do tonight is take Eddie's cock in your hand and guide it into me before you sit down and watch." 

"God Stel; I don't know if I could do something like that." 

"Think about it baby. It would really show me that you are okay with what I'm doing." 

"I'll think about it Stel, but I'm making no promises that it will happen." 

As distasteful as it was going to be I was going to have to do it. I needed Stella in the right frame of mind in order to make what I wanted to happen work the way I wanted it to. 

The evening with Eddie started out with Eddie lying to me. 

"I told you when I was last here hat your wife was my bitch now right?" 

I nodded my head yes. 

"I fucked her in the supply closet at work on both Thursday and Friday and she loved it and begged for more. We took a long lunch Monday and I fucked her three times and last night I fucked her four times while you were rolling that stupid ball. Twice in the ass. I really like that tight ass of hers." 

Stella was on the bed on her hands and knees waiting to be fucked and smiling as Eddie said: 

"Time to prove that you know she's my bitch. Take my cock and put it in her." 

He stepped up behind her and they both looked at me and waited. I took a deep breath and said to my self, "Suck it up Frank" and then I walked over to them, took Eddie's cock in my hand and put it in Stella's cunt. Then I moved to my chair and watched as Eddie fucked the bitch. Eddie fucked her hard and after he came she sucked him hard again and then I took out my dick and beat my meat while I watched Eddie take her ass. After he shot off into her he pulled out, looked at me and said: 

"She needs to suck me hard again, but she doesn't want to suck on a shitty dick. Help me wash it." 

I hadn't planned on that, but I couldn't see any way around it if I was to stay in the part I was playing so I followed him into the bathroom. I did the best I could not to barf as I washed and dried his cock. We went back into the bedroom and he told me to hold his dick out so Stella could suck it. I didn't see any reason not to after washing and drying the fucking thing so I did it. Just before Stella took him in her mouth he said: 

"Maybe you want to do it. You are already a cuckold so maybe you should learn how." 

"Maybe next time" I said. "I'm new to this stuff and I need to ease into it." 

"You'll like it. You like getting them right?" 

I nodded a yes and went back to my chair and watched him fuck Stella one more time. When he was done he looked over at me and said: 

"You want to lick me clean? Kind of give you a taste of what sucking a dick might be like?" 

"I'll need to talk it over with Stella. Maybe a little bit down the road." 

He gave me a smirk that said, "You'll do it. You're a fucking pussy whipped wimp and the bitch will have you sucking cocks in a month." 

Stella licked him clean and then walked him out while I showered and in bed. When she came back into the room she asked: 

"Are you going to eat me before you make love to me?" 

"Not this time love. I've got to get used to the idea that I just handled another man's cock. I never thought that there would ever come a day when I would do something like that." 

She got into bed with me and before I realized what she was going to do she kissed me and shoved her tongue in my mouth. She broke the kiss and said: 

"See? I had his cum in my mouth and it didn't kill you did it? Come on baby; please lick him out of me." 

"Don't push it Stel. I'll work up to it, but I'm not ready yet. These are major changes that I'm going through and I need time to come to grips with them." 

"But you will take sloppy seconds won't you? I need to make love to you when we do these things. You're my man and I have to make sure that I prove it to you." 

I did fuck her and she sucked me hard for a second time and again I thought about how much I was going to miss that part of our marriage. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Friday Stella had a baby shower to go to, or so she said, and I used her absence to listen to the Thursday and Friday morning phone calls. 

"Oh my God Anna, I swear that Frank is almost ready to be a Dennis clone. He actually put Eddie's cock in me; not once, but twice. He even washed Eddie's cock after Eddie fucked me in the butt. When I walked Eddie out he said he would bet me a hundred bucks that Frank would be sucking his cock before the month was over. Then he said he'd bet me another hundred that he would be fucking Frank's ass within a month of getting Frank to suck his dick. I didn't take the bets because after seeing Frank wash Eddie's cock I believe that it will happen. God Anna, I can't wait. Just the thought of Frank squealing like a pig when Eddie corn holes him had me masturbating in the shower. I'll even bet that Eddie will convince Frank to clean Eddie's shit covered dick after he fucks me in the ass." 

"You better slow down girl. You keep using Eddie and your hubby might start thinking he is being replaced by a steady boyfriend." 

"You're right. I'd better see if I can get Jared to play my game with me. I'm so close Anna; I'm just so damned close to having my own submissive slave." Then she laughed and said, "I'm even having thoughts about dressing him up in a dress, nylons and high heels for the times Eddie or Jared fuck him in the ass. Got to run if I'm not going to be late for work. John gets real cranky if I don't give him his morning blow job before the rest of the employees show up." 

I'd thought I'd need a little more time to prep Stella, but it was obvious to me from that phone call that she was ready. 

I was still awake and waiting for Stella when she got home. She was an unfaithful whore, but she was superb pussy and I wanted as much of it as I could get before I dropped the hammer on her. We fucked – I had stopped thinking of it as making love – Friday, Saturday and Sunday and while Stella was showering for work Monday morning I listened to the weekend's phone conversations. Nothing on Saturday, but on Sunday Anna gave Stella Jared's phone number and told Stella that he was expecting her call. Stella said she would call him from work later that day. That evening over dinner Stella asked me when we could do it again. 

"Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, take your pick." 

"But you bowl on Tuesday and have your meetings on Wednesday." 

"The fall winter league ended last Tuesday and the spring summer league doesn't start up for another six weeks and there is no Wednesday meeting this week because all of the Aerie officers are at a state meeting of some sort." 

"Wednesday then?" 

"Okay by me." 

"Can I do someone else or does it have to be Eddie?" 

"What's wrong with Eddie?" 

"He is getting to get too possessive. He is starting to think of himself as my steady boyfriend." 

"Well we certainly can't be having that. Have you got a replacement picked out?" 

"One of the guys who works on the loading dock. His name is Jared and he has hit on me several times. I think I'll surprise him and take him up on it." 

"After you explain the situation to him he might not be all that eager." 

"I'll just have to see." 

"Don't be silly Stel. Any man alive and breathing is going to want you any way he can get you even if it is in a room full of people watching." 

"You say the sweetest things baby. I think I'll keep you." 

I almost laughed at that. I was already gone and she just didn't know it. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Monday over dinner Stella told me that Jared was willing. "It was just like you said baby. He told me that he would screw me on the court house steps in broad daylight and give me an hour to draw a crowd. I hate to sound like a one track record, but will you eat me out after Jared fucks me? It would be such a great turn on for me. I even get myself off in the shower thinking about it." 

"I still get a little queasy when I think about it, but if it means so much to you I guess I can try it. I just hope I don't ruin your night by jumping up and running to the bathroom to toss my cookies." 

"It will be okay baby. You've kissed me when I've had Eddie's cum in my mouth and you did get a taste of him off your finger that time." 

Tuesday morning Stella told me that she would be stopping after work for drinks with Anna and that they might go over to Anna's place to play some cards. 

"We set it up before I knew that bowling was over." 

When I got home from work Stella wasn't there so I checked to see if there was anything on the recorder. 

"I called Jared and he is going to do it. I'm meeting him tonight to go over the scenario I want to play Wednesday night. No doubt that I'll end up fucking him before the evening is over. I hope Jared doesn't mind sloppy seconds because John told me yesterday afternoon to plan on a long lunch today. The big news is that Frank told me that he will eat me out after Jared fucks me. I can't wait. I'm going to try and get him to lick Jared's dick clean, but that might be a hard sell this early. Wish me luck girlfriend. The day we can lay on a bed next to each other, get fucked by a couple of studs and then have Dennis and Frank do clean up is getting close." 

I just shook my head. How could she have been with me as long as she had and not know me any better than she did? Stella wasn't usually stupid. She had to know – just had to know – that the way I was behaving lately wasn't the real me. She had to know that something about the whole scene didn't ring right as far as I was concerned. Oh well, she would find out soon enough. 

Wednesday morning Stella told me that Jared would be there at seven and she was looking forward to the evening. I just smiled and told her that I was too. That evening at five-forty I called Stella and told her that we'd had an emergency at work and I would be late. Possibly very late. 

"But what about Jared?" 

"Just enjoy yourself sweetie. I'll make it up to you the next time." 

I went down to the sports bar and had a few drinks while I watched the Redwings play the Avalanche. I got home at a quarter after ten and found Stella waiting up for me. 

"I haven't cleaned myself baby. I saved all of Jared for you to lick out of me." 

"Not tonight Stel. After the mess at work I'm just not in the mood and truth be told I would have needed to be here and seen things to get me worked up enough to do it. I'll make it up to you on Friday." 

"On Friday?" 

"Yes sweetie, on Friday I'll see to it that you get what you deserve." 

"Will you at least take sloppy seconds?" 

"I can do that Stel. You know I can never turn down your hot pussy." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Thursday morning over breakfast I told Stella, "Friday night I'm going to go all out for you baby. I'm not stupid and I know what your plan is. Don't bother denying it because I know better. What you are trying to lead me into is sucking a cock while you watch. All this "eat me out after Eddie fucks me" is just the lead up to you finally asking me to lick a cock clean after it comes out of you." 

She looked at me in opened mouth astonishment as I continued. 

"You probably even want to see me on my hands and knees taking your lover's cock up my ass. Well I have a surprise for you. I've always wondered what it would be like to suck a cock and I've always wondered what it feels like to get ass fucked so tomorrow night I'm going to give you what you want." 

"Oh my God! I would never have believed it. You are right and those are things I would love to see. I'd cum buckets watching that happen. Who do you want? Eddie would do it for sure, but you've never met Jared." 

"Neither of them. Once I figured out what you were really shooting for I began to make plans to see that it happened. I don't know Eddie at all and as you have pointed out I've never seen Jared. The last thing I want to happen is walk into some place where Eddie or Jared are with some friends and have them point me out and snicker. He'd tell them what a wimp I was to let him fuck you and then suck him clean and his friends would see me around and point me out their friends and pretty soon every one would know and I wouldn't be able to walk around and hold my head up in public. No, I've come up with a better way. 

"You have never met him, but I'm sure that you've heard me speak of Phil Martin. He is one of my lodge brothers and I'd trust him with my life. Come to think of it I am trusting him with my life. He has agreed to do it and I trust him to never tell a soul. He will be here at seven. Between now and seven tomorrow evening you need to think of everything you want me to do and I'll do it no matter what." 

She looked at me stunned. 

"I don't know what to say. You've caught me totally off guard with this." 

"What you can say is "Thank you my love." 

"I can do better than that. I'll call in sick and spend the day fucking you to death to thank you." 

"I would really like that, but I'll have to settle for a hot night tonight instead. Owning the business means I have to be there even if it is only to unlock the door and let the help in." 

"Then you better plan on tonight and take plenty of vitamins because I don't plan on your being able to walk when I'm done with you." 

And she damned near did it. I fell asleep totally exhausted at one-thirty. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I spent a good part of Friday doing the necessaries and I was home at seven when Phil rang the door bell. I had Stella naked except for her 'come fuck me' pumps and I had her lying on the couch. After Phil got a good eyeful of the slut and I had introduced them I said: 

Let's take it to the bedroom and do what we are here for." 

Stella was all smiles as she got up from the couch and took Phil by the hand and led him to the bedroom. When we got to the bedroom I said: 

"You two go ahead and get started. Knowing what I'm going to be doing later is going to take some courage and fortunately I have a bottle of it downstairs. It is labeled Jim Beam and also fortunately for me it is almost full." 

"Hurry back lover; I can't wait" Stella said and I replied, "Neither can I sweetie. It is going to be a memorable event." 

I left the room and went down into the basement. I got a PBR out of the mini- fridge next to my work bench. Opened the cabinet just above it and turned on the equipment inside. I got a folding chair and sat down to drink my beer as I watched the output of the spy cam in the bedroom. 

Stella was undressing Phil and when she got all of his clothes off of him she went to her knees in front of him and took his cock into her mouth. She licked it from tip to base and then back up to the tip and then she started fucking him with her mouth. After a couple of minutes of that she stood up and led him to the bed. 

She laid down, spread her legs and waited for Phil to climb on board. Instead he got down and started eating her. Her hands came up and she ran her fingers through his hair. After a couple of minutes he pushed a finger into her ass and her eyes shot open and she gasped. Her hands gripped his head and she tried to pull his head inside her pussy. He kept eating her and finger fucking her ass. 

Another two minutes of that and he pulled away and mounted her. Her legs came up, wrapped around him and her hands grabbed his ass and pulled him to her. He fucked her hard and fast as she moaned and cried out in pleasure. Stella was so into it that she either didn't notice that I wasn't in the room or she didn't care. After several minutes of hard fucking he pulled out of her cunt, got her up on her hands and knees and then speared back into her pussy. 

As he fucked her he worked on her ass with his thumb and fingers. When he was ready, or thought she was, he pulled out of her pussy and pushed into her ass. The bitch was into it all right. She was pushing back at him as he drove into her. As I watched Phil fuck the slut I had to laugh at the situation. She was fucking three guys besides me for free and here I was paying Phil a hundred bucks to fuck her. 

Stella's "Fuck my ass, fuck my ass" came through the speakers loud and clear and while I watched Phil plunder her ass I ran a mental checklist to make sure that I hadn't forgotten anything. 

Cleaned out checking and savings? Check 

Cleaned out safe deposit box? Check. 

Cancelled all joint credit cards? Check. 

Final meeting with attorney to insure all paperwork done? Check. 

Apartment rented? Check 

Clothes packed and loaded in the car? Check. 

Yep, I had it all covered. The only thing I would still need to do was come back with a trailer to get the big stuff like my tool box, air compressor, floor jack and jack stands. And probably a few other things I might have forgotten. Stella would probably make it difficult, but my attorney assured me that it would be no problem getting a court order and a deputy to go with me to serve it and keep and eye on Stella while I got my things. 

On the screen I saw Phil grab Stella's hips and pull her tight against him as he emptied his balls into her. She looked around as Phil pulled out and finally noticed that I was not there. Phil walked over to his clothes and got an envelope out of his suit coat pocket and walked back over to Stella. He handed her the envelope and she looked up at him with a confused look on her face as she asked: 

"What's this?" 

"You have been served" Phil said and walked back to his clothes and started dressing as Stella was saying: 

"Served? What do you mean "served." 

"Open the envelope. All your answers are in there." 

As she opened the envelope she asked, "Why did you give this to me?" 

"It's my job although I do have to admit that this was the most pleasurable service I've done. I even got an extra hundred out of it." 

"An extra hundred? What does that mean?" 

"I get a flat fee for a service, but your husband paid me an extra hundred to do it this way." 

"Frank? Frank gave you a hundred dollars?" She looked around. "Where is Frank?" 

"Don't know. He paid me to fuck you and then serve you. My guess, given the circumstances, is that he is gone." 

By then Stella had the envelope open and saw what was inside. "Noooo" she wailed, "this wasn't supposed to happen." 

"Sorry" Phil said as he left the room and headed for the front door. 

In the bedroom Stella was frantically getting some clothes on. She was crying as she pulled on slippers and headed out of the room. I could hear her moving through the house calling out: 

"Frank? Frank? Where are you?" 

It sounded like she was going room to room and her "Frank?" was sounding more and more panicky. She would eventually get to me and I set things up to be ready for her. The door at the top of the stairs opened and she called down: 

"Frank? Frank? Are you down there Frank?" 

I didn't answer and I heard her start down the steps to look for herself to see if I was there or not. She got to the bottom of the stairs and saw me. 

"Frank? I've been calling for you. Why haven't you answered me? And what's this nonsense about a divorce?" 

I pushed the 'play' button on the recorder. Color drained from her face as she heard:  

===

"Frank's the type alright. I boss him around all the time. I even make him get in the bath tub so I can piss on him. Being able to dominate him that way turns me on." 

As the rest of the taped conversations played on Stella seemed to deflate like a balloon that the air slowly leaks out of. She looked away from me and started crying when she heard: 

"I make sure that I have sex with him every time after John fucks me and our sex always starts with Frank eating my pussy." 

I just looked at her and said, "Come as a shock to you that I'm not the clueless doofus that you thought I was? Have any more questions about why I'm getting a divorce?" 

I got up and said, "See you around Stel, or maybe not." 

I picked up the tape recorder and the video recorder that had just taped her fuck session with Phil and also had the footage of her fun with Jared and then I left the house and headed for my apartment. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I spent Saturday making up another list of things to do. I needed things to make my apartment more homey and livable and I needed to look into putting the house up for sale. Stella was going to have to get with the utility companies and set up accounts because item number two on my list was to have everything shut off and taken out of my name. If I put a good enough price on the house it should move quickly. Of course Stella could decide that she wanted to keep it and then she would have to buy me out. 

Thank God we didn't live in one of those dumb assed states that had those stupid no fault divorce laws. I filed listing adultery as the cause and my attorney had assured me that I would come out of the divorce well ahead of a half and half split. He told me that even the one female judge that we had would be upset at the humiliating way Stella talked about me in her recorded conversations. The video of her with Jared and Phil would just be icing on the cake. 

After golf I stopped at the TGI Friday on Lamont to get a bite to eat and while I was eating a very good looking redhead came up to the table and said: 

"Frank Marly right?" 

I said yeas and she said, "You don't know me Frank; I'm Barbara Collins and I want to thank you for saving my marriage." 

"I saved your marriage? What did I do?" 

"It's what you did to Stella. It opened my eyes to what Brian might do to me if I'd have let myself get sucked into that crap that Anna was spouting about how to control a man. I admit that the thought of being able to do it was a turn on, but it wouldn't have worth losing Brian. When I heard what happened to Stella it was a wake up call. I'm sorry about you and Stella, but some good did come out of it. It saved me and Brian. You take care now" and she turned and walked away. 

I wasn't at all surprised at getting half a dozen calls from Stella on my cell phone and I deleted them as soon as they came in. I left the cell in the apartment when I went to play golf on Sunday and I wasn't surprised to find a dozen more missed messages from Stella when I got home. I knew I was going to have to talk to her sooner or later and probably the next day as I couldn't have her calling me at work a dozen or so times a day. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

Her first call came just after I had unlocked the door. When the phone rang the caller ID said it was the home phone so I answered and asked: 

"What do you want Stella?" 

"I don't want a divorce Frank. You don't understand what was going on and we need to sit down and talk so I can explain it to you. I love you Frank and you know I do. We just need to talk it out." 

"You love me? Really? You sure have a funny way of showing it. You tell me that you are taking night classes so you can get a promotion while what you were really doing was spending two nights a week being your boss's fuck toy. Yep, I can see the love for me in that. And after the promotion you kept giving him a blow job every morning, fucking him on lunch hour and then coming home to me and letting me eat your pussy. Yep, you bet, the love comes shinning through there. And you sure showed me lots of love when you fucked Eddie and Jared over at Anna's and I wouldn't want to forget all the love for me that I heard in your voice in the month's worth of phone calls between you, Anna and Barb that I taped. Oh yes indeed Stella, I am well aware of just how much you loved me." 

"You don't understand Frank and that's why we need to sit down and talk. Please come home. I don't want a divorce and I'll fight it. I'll make it so expensive for you that in the end you'll drop it." 

"Ah, there's that love shinning through again. Tell you what Stel; you just go ahead and fight it. You will have to get an attorney and they don't come cheap. You are going to need every cent you have to make the house payment, and pay for the gas, phone and lights which, by the way, I've had taken out of my name and which will be shut off at the end of the month. That's two weeks away so you need to be thinking about how to keep them turned on. 

"Now let's see how you can hurt me. No kids so no leverage there. You take home as much as I do so no alimony to worry about. I filed using adultery as grounds and I have the evidence to back it up. Also one little thing that you probably forgot about. The business is family owned and my father explained to you that a prenuptial agreement that guaranteed that the business would remain totally in family hands had to be signed by you before we could get married and you signed it without even reading it. One of the clauses in that pre-nup specified that in case of a divorce because of adultery the offending party would leave the relationship with only what they brought into it. 

"So go ahead Stella. Get an attorney and fight it. Look on the bright side. You will be free to find some sick fuck who will suck your lover's cock and smile up at you while your lover fucks him up the ass. Got to get to work. Bye Stella." 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

That wasn't the end of it though. The next day when I left work Stella was parked behind my car and since I was parked nose in to the building I couldn't just ignore her and leave. 

"What do you want Stella?" 

"Quite simply, you. I do not want a divorce. I know you don't think I love you, but you are wrong." 

"Bullshit Stella. I told you the other day that I have over a months worth of phone calls between you and Anna that tell me exactly how you feel about your clueless twit of a husband." 

"That's just it Frank. You don't have anything that shows you that. What you have is a bunch of rubbish that I said to Anna because that is what she wanted to hear. Anna hates men. It was something that she let me know during the first week I met her. One of the biggest surprises of my life was when she moved back here and I found out that she was married. It turns out that she married Dennis because she found out that she could do to him what she wanted to do to all men. I can't say that I blame her. I'd probably have felt the same way if my life had been like hers." 

"Again Stella – Bullshit!! If she hated men why was she fucking at least two that I know of and by that I mean Eddie and Jared." 

"She fucked them, but she didn't like them. She fucked them to torment Dennis. It was sort of like religion. You know, the "Christ died for your sins" thing? Dennis was paying the price for what men had done to her. Her own father raped her every time he came home drunk. When he was killed in an accident her mother remarried. The man she married had two sons. Her mother went into the hospital for some reason or other and while she was in there the stepfather raped Anna. Her two step brothers saw it happen and decided that they wanted some and then the three of them took turns on her all the time her mom was gone. 

"The assholes knew they were toast if she went to the cops and so they taped themselves doing her and then edited the tape to eliminate the part where she fought them and made it look like she was willing. All that showed was the part where her body betrayed her and actually got into it. They showed her the tapes they had made of her responding and told her if she ever told anyone about what they had been doing or called the cops and hollered rape they would spread the tapes all over town. One night when they were sleeping she took a ball bat to them, cleaned out their wallets and left. Since then she has hated men in general. Everything I told her what was what she wanted to hear. I didn't mean a word of it Frank, not one word. Think about it Frank. Have I ever shown you any disrespect?" 

"Yeah Stella; as a matter of fact you have." 

"How and when?" 

"Every time you came home from work after fucking John and let me eat your pussy." 

"I've never done that to you." 

"Bullshit Stella! I've listened to you tell Anna all about it too many times." 

"And I've told you that everything I've told Stella is what she wanted to hear." 

"I suppose the next thing you will tell me is that you never fucked John and all that you told Anna about starting his day with blow jobs is baloney also." 

"No Frank; I'll admit to that, but you never ate him out of me and I never kissed you with his taste still in my mouth. I keep a travel bag with a douche bag and wash in my bottom desk drawer and I always, and I do mean always Frank, washed, douched and brushed my teeth before I came home to you." 

"You admit to cheating on me with your boss?" 

"Yes Frank, but it never hurt us. Did you ever see a lack of love or affection from me? Did I ever short you in the love or sex departments? No, I never did." 

"But you did cheat on me with your boss." 

"I didn't see it as cheating. At least not at first." 

"Not at first?" 

"We needed money Frank. If you'll remember business wasn't all that good and you were talking about maybe having to close the doors. We were behind on some bills and my getting a promotion would have meant another thousand a month coming in so when John made me the offer I took it. It was only blow jobs and to me cheating meant giving up pussy and I wasn't going to give up any of that. It was only supposed to be blow jobs until his wife had the baby and was cleared to have sex again." 

"Not that I don't consider blow jobs as not cheating, but what changed?" 

"The size of his cock. It was huge! I measured it once and it was almost eleven inches. You know I wasn't a virgin when I married you, but I had never seen a cock that big. I fought it Frank. Honest to God I did fight it, but after two weeks of giving John head I just had to see what a cock like that felt like. Once I started it just seemed natural to continue on until Linda had the baby and John could go back to getting his sex from her. I knew it was cheating, but I also knew that you would never know and the money from my promotion got us out of the hole. And it never interfered with us Frank. I gave you all the love and sex you could handle. There was no love between me and John; it was more or less a business arrangement. I love you Frank; honest to God I do and I did everything I could think of to make sure that you knew it." 

"As far as I know his wife had her kid six or seven months ago and yet you are still fucking him." 

"They are going through a divorce. The baby's father was obviously an oriental so he kicked her out. He asked me to keep on doing what I was and I told him that I couldn't so he sweetened the pot. He gave me a five hundred dollar raise and the company car that I've been driving for the last six months. He also gave me a company credit card to pay for the gas and upkeep. Again, you would never know so I gave in. To make sure that you would never find out I never let him do me anywhere other than work. He wanted to do me on a bed and I refused because going to a hotel or motel would be just asking for someone to see us and maybe tell you. He ended up buying a couch for the office that turned into a bed, plus he had that large motor home that he started parking at work. I was so careful to make sure you would never find out. How did you?" 

I told her about overhearing her comment to Anna at the barbecue and how that got me to wondering what else she had to say about me and how that led me to finding out everything. 

"So even if I bought into your affair with John as helping us financially that doesn't excuse what you did with Eddie and Jared. That was flat out cheating and you know it." 

"No it wasn't. I didn't do Eddie until after – after Frank – you had given me permission and to me that open marriage thing you talked about WAS giving me permission and I did bring them home with me once I knew you were really good with it. As far as you were concerned you were setting me up, but from my side I believed what you were telling me. I never would have done it with Eddie and Jared if I didn't believe that you were okay with it. Your exact words to me were that it would be okay as long as I came home to you. I did Eddie and Jared at Anna's and then I came home to you and gave you every bit as much as I gave them. I'll quit my job Frank. I'll never talk to Anna again. Don't divorce me Frank. Please. I couldn't bear losing you." 

"If you loved me so much why were you so set on turning me into a willing cuckold? I fail to see where there was any love in you wanting me to hold another man's cock in my hand and guide it into you and I sure as hell didn't see any love in you wanting to see me sucking another man's cock or watch him fuck me in the ass while – what was it you said to Anna? – while I squealed like a pig?" 

"In the first place Frank I never wanted you to do any of those things if you didn't want to. It is like my peeing on you in the tub. It was a major turn on for me and you didn't mind doing it because when I got turned on I rocked your world. What Anna did with her husband was a turn on and when I came home from Anna's I did my best to fuck your brains out. So I wondered if it would turn me on to see you doing it. The only way I could find out was to try. It was no different than when I wanted to see what it would be like to pee in your mouth. You shut that down immediately and I expected that you would do the same to anything else I wanted to try and you didn't. 

"Why wouldn't I try? You sat there and got turned on when Eddie fucked me in front of you and don't you dare try to deny it. Your cock was as hard as I've ever seen it as you jacked yourself off. After seeing that why wouldn't I try to see what else you might do? The squeal like a pig comment and talking about you sucking another man was just more of telling Anna what she wanted to hear. 

"Back to the pissing in the mouth thing; I knew that you would never do what you didn't want to do, but I had no way of knowing what you would or wouldn't do without trying to see. I can tell you that seeing you suck off another man or seeing you take it in the butt wouldn't do a thing for me. I watched Dennis do it and it was obvious that he hated doing it. It was one of the few things that he did that wasn't a turn on, but a turn off. 

"I really did want you to suck another man out of me, but I had no interest in seeing you clean another man's cock with your mouth, but again I had no idea of what you might or might not want to try. The night you set me up for Phil I honestly believed what you told me about what you had always wanted to do. Why wouldn't I have? I have a head full of things I've always wanted to do but was afraid to try. Why wouldn't I believe that you did to? 

"John was a major mistake, but I honestly had us in mind when I did it. I really did do it for the promotion and what the money would do for us. I let myself get carried away and I'm sorry, but again Frank it didn't hurt us and I always came home and gave you more than I gave him. I made a mistake and I'm asking you – no, I'm begging you – to forgive me. Don't leave me Frank; please don't leave me." 

"It is a nice fairy tale that you are spinning here Stella, but the fact of the matter is that you are still a cheating cunt. It doesn't matter what your rational is for putting out for your boss it was still cheating." 

"Then what can I do to pay for my crime that doesn't include my losing you? I love you Frank. Honest to God I do and I always have." 

"Maybe you do. I really don't know, but what I do know is that what you have done has made it pretty much impossible for me to stay with you. I could never trust you again. Who knows when you might fuck some other guy because you just knew that I'd never know about it. You know what they say Stella; once a cheater always a cheater." 

"I swear to you Frank that I'll never do it again." 

"You swore to God to be a loving and faithful wife in front of eighty-three family and friends, but you broke that vow so I see no reason to believe that you won't break the one you just made. We are through Stella. There is nothing that you can do that will ever make it right. Now please move your car so I can leave." 

"Please Frank; I'll die without you." 

"Then I guess I'd better make sure to keep your life insurance paid up to date." 

I turned and started to walk away. 

"Where are you going Frank?" 

"Since you won't move and let me out I'm going inside to use the phone to call a cab." 

"Please Frank, please don't leave me." 

I didn't turn back. I went into the building and called for a taxi.  

===

I sat there and stared at her incredulously. It took a few seconds for what she had said to register and in those few seconds my mind went back in time. 

I'd met Tanya Louise Marshall on the first day of school when I started the eighth grade. She had just moved to town and didn't know anyone in the class. From the first time I'd laid eyes on her I was lost. I introduced myself and she gave me a big smile and said that she was glad to meet me. 

My eyes followed her everywhere she went and when school let out for the day I asked her if I could walk her home and she said that it was sweet of me to ask, but she was going with some of the girls she'd met that day. 

That was just the first of a thousand rejections that I received over the next ten years. They were always nice and gentle refusals, but refusals none the less. When we graduated from college she took a job somewhere on the west coast and I went to work in the family business and did my best to forget Tanya. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Even though my mind was always on Tanya I didn't let my feelings for her get in the way of my dating others. I did have an active social life even if I wasn't having it with the girl I wanted to have it with. Pauline French relieved me of my virginity and Harlina Collins, Beverly Abbeg and Nancy Wilde saw to the furtherance of my sexual education. 

A year out of college I met and married Nancy Neubert. The marriage only lasted two years. It ended when I caught her in bed with her high school sweetheart. It was a cliché. I came home early one day and caught Nancy and her lover in bed. 

I was very civil about it and simply told him to get dressed and get out of my house and he dressed and left without a word. I told Nancy to pack a bag and go stay with her parents while I talked to an attorney to see where things would go from there. 

She begged me to let her stay and told me that it wasn't what I thought it was. I laughed at that and she said: 

"Its true baby; it wasn't what you think. I love you and you know I do. All that happened here today was closure. Closure for both Alan and me" and then she told me the story. 

She and Alan had been a couple from the seventh grade on. By the tenth they were already talking about marriage after high school graduation. Alan felt that since they were going to get married anyway it wouldn't matter if they started having sex. Nancy told him no. She told him that she intended to go to her marriage bed a virgin. He kept pushing and pushing and she finally broke down enough to start giving him hand jobs. By mid eleventh grade she had progressed to giving Alan blow jobs. 

Alan still kept pressing and she promised him that she would give him more sex than he could handle once they tied the knot, but not before. He told her he was going to hold her to that promise. 

During the summer vacation between eleventh and twelfth grades Alan's father took a promotion that required that they move eleven hundred miles away. Alan promised that he would come back for her as soon as he had his high school diploma and then he reminded her of her promise. 

Nancy and Alan had stayed in touch all through the next year and then suddenly she stopped hearing from him and all her letters to him went unanswered. After a while she figured that he had found someone new and she got on with her life. 

We met and married and then one day Alan showed up where she worked and they had a tearful reunion. Over lunch Alan brought Nancy up to date on what had happened to him. He and his mom and dad had been involved in a five car pile up on I-5 and his parents had been killed. He had survived, but was in a comma for nine months. When he had come out of it he had no long term memory. After a year in rehab and therapy his memory had come back and as soon as he was able he had come back for her. He was bitter at finding out she was married. 

They had lunch together a couple of times a week and according to Nancy she only did it because she felt so bad over thinking that he had found someone else and that's why he stopped communicating with her. Over one of those lunches he reminded her of her promise to him. She told him she couldn't because she was now married to me. He told her that she owed him for all the times she sent him home with blue balls and she kept saying that she couldn't, 

Alan kept working on her and she decided that she would do it one time with him more to settle what she thought of as a debt than because of love. It would give closure to their interrupted relationship. 

"I felt I owed him baby. After all he had been through he came for me only to find that I hadn't waited for him. It was only going to be the one time and you were never supposed to know about it. Honest to God baby it was only going to be the one time. I love you Frank and you know I do. Please try to understand and please, for God's sake, forgive me." 

I told her she still needed to pack a bag and leave because I had a lot of thinking to do and I didn't need her around distracting me. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

She went to stay with her folks and I spent a week thinking about the situation and in the end I decided to take a chance on Nancy. She came back home and then proceeded to do her absolute best to spoil me rotten and fuck me to death. 

After a couple of months it occurred to me that she was trying too hard and I started thinking that it was her way to keep me from thinking about what she might be doing so I decided to do some checking. I could account for all of her time in the evenings and on the weekends, but then I remembered that she said that she had met her old boyfriend for lunches. 

I took a couple of days off work and was parked down the block from where Nancy worked about a half hour before her lunch hour. Nothing happened on Monday, but Tuesday she came out of the building at twelve noon and I followed her to the Starlight Motel. She pulled up and parked in front of room 103 and sat there. Two minutes later a car with California plates pulled up next to her. Alan got out of the car, walked over to Nancy's car, leaned in her window to kiss her and then went to the office. He came back with a key and the two of them went into room 103. 

I sat and watched the door to 103 until Nancy came out and then I followed her back to work. Once she went inside I went back to the Starlight and a fifty dollar bill got me the information that Alan Pendergast had a standing reservation for room 103 on Tuesdays and Fridays. I'd never heard of a specific motel room being reserved so I asked if there was anything special about the room that would make it desirable and I found out that it was the only room with a hot tub. All of the odd numbered rooms on the first floor were supposed to have hot tubs, but the builder ran into financial problems before the other hot tubs could be installed. 

As I drove home a plan took shape in my mind. Surprisingly enough I felt no animosity toward Pendergast. All he had done was come back for the woman he loved. True, she was with another when he got there, but he loved her, wanted her and so he didn't give a rat's ass about me. I didn't doubt for a minute that part of the time he spent with her was spent trying to get her to leave me for him. The only question in my mind was why she didn't do it? It was obvious to me that she wanted to be with him. Why else would she be meeting him? 

That evening Nancy was her usual amorous self and I went along with the program as I did again Wednesday and Thursday. Friday when she pulled up and parked in front of room 103 I was in place and ready to put my plan into action. As soon as the two of them were in the room I backed the U-Haul truck I had rented up next to Nancy's car and started unloading boxes. I'd rented the truck Thursday and had purchased seventy-five moving boxes. I left for work at my normal time on Friday, but had only driven around the block and then waited for Nancy to leave for work. I went home and packed everything of Nancy's into the boxes. I packed up everything that we had bought because she wanted it and then I drove over to the Starlight and waited. 

I unloaded the boxes as quietly as I could and then I stacked the boxes in front of the door of the motel room. It built a wall three boxes deep and the only way to get out of the room would be to tear down the wall from inside the room and that wouldn't be an easy task since the wall went higher the door to the room. They would have to wrestle a box out of the first row only to find another row behind it. The last thing I did was lean the bed frame, box spring and mattress that Nancy had cheated on against the box wall. 

The last part of the plan would take place when the two of them had finally worked their way out of the room. They would find a process server waiting to hand Nancy an envelope and to tell her that she had been served. 

I drove home and prepared myself for the meeting that I knew was coming. Such preparation being three fingers of Jack over ice. I didn't bother changing the locks on the house. Nancy's name was on the title with mine and her paychecks helped pay the bills. I doubted that we could co-exist until the divorce was final so it was likely that one of us would have to move out, but it wouldn't necessarily be Nancy. 

The phone rang at 3:10 and in answer to my "Hello" I got a "Can I come home?" 

"It isn't a home anymore Nance, but yes, you can come to the house." 

She walked in at 3:25 and the first thing out of her mouth was a cliché. "It isn't what you think baby. I can explain if you'll let me." 

"Go ahead. It has been a difficult day for me and I could use a laugh." 

"I love you baby; honest to God I do, but I also have strong feelings for Alan. He was so much a part of my life that yadda, yadda, yadda..." 

I listened and let her run down and then I said, "What you are telling me is that you want us both since you can't seem to choose between us." 

I think I saw just a glimmer of hope on her face before I continued, "Since you can't seem to choose I guess it is up to me to make the choice and I choose not to be married to a cheating whore." 

I looked at my watch and then said, "If you hurry you might be able to get to Alan's place in time to fix him dinner." 

"But baby I ..." 

"Just go Nancy. You are damaged goods and I want no part of you." 

It was a pretty messy divorce since it turned out that Nancy was pregnant and I wasn't going to accept paternity until I could be sure that the baby was mine. It wasn't and because of that and a prenuptial agreement she had signed Nancy didn't come out of it all that well. The only surprise was that she didn't move in with Alan. He left town two months after I had her served and he didn't take her with him. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Three months after the divorce became final I was sitting at the bar in the Landing Strip Lounge which was my watering hole of choice. It was open mike night and a parade of would be standup comics was entertaining the crowd. 

A girl I recognized as a clerk at the gas station/convenience store I occasionally stopped at was doing her routine and since I knew her well enough to say hi to I listened to her routine. 

"A man said to his wife one day "I don't know how you can be so beautiful and so stupid at the same time." 

"The wife said "Allow me to explain. God made me beautiful so you would be attracted to me. God made me stupid so I would be attracted to you." 

That got a loud laugh and some foot stomping applause from most of the women in the audience and she continued on. The next one must have been for Bobby Denton because everyone knew about his penchant for blond jokes. 

"A mathematician, a philosopher and a blond go to Hell and receive a challenge from the Devil. If they can stump him they can go to Heaven instead of being roasted by the fires in Hell. The philosopher goes first and asks the Devil a very hard question. The Devil smiled and said, "That the best you got?" and then rattled off the answer. The mathematician went next and the Devil instantly gave the answer. When it was the blonds' turn she took a chair and bored three holes in the seat. She sat down on the chair and she farted. Then she looked at the Devil and said: 

"Now tell me which hole the fart came out of." 

"That's easy. It came out all three of them." 

The blond laughed at him and said, "No stupid. It came out of my butthole." 

That one got a decent laugh and then she said, "One more then I've got to get home and get the kids to bed. 

"In a dark and hazy room, peering into the crystal ball, the Mystic delivered the grave news to Laura. 

"There is no easy way to tell you this so I'll just have to be blunt. Prepare yourself to be a widow. Your husband will die a horrible and violent death this year." 

Visibly shaken, Laura stared at the women's lined face, then at the single flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to compose herself and to stop her mind racing. She simply had to know. She met the Mystic's gaze, steadied herself and then asked in a quivering voice, "Will I be acquitted?" 

That one nearly brought the house down and she blew kisses to the audience as Bobby Denton walked out to take the mike from her hand. 

I had only meant to stop for one beer before heading for home, but I was enjoying myself so I decided to have another beer. That decision was to lead to a startling consequence. Bobby asked if there was anyone in the audience who would like to come up and take a shot at making the crowd laugh and a hand went up from a woman at table with four other women. Her back was to me, but just as my second cold PBR was set down on the bar in front of me the woman turned and my heart damned near stopped. 

The woman was Tanya. 

Time had not lessened the effect that she'd had on me since the day I first met her. She took the mike from Bobby and thanked him for giving her the chance to embarrass herself in public and then said: 

"A nice, calm and respectable lady went into the pharmacy, walked up to the pharmacist, looked him straight in the eye and said: 

"I'd like to by some cyanide." 

The pharmacist asked, "Why in the world do you need cyanide?" 

The lady replied, "I want to poison my husband." 

The pharmacist's eyes got big and he exclaimed. "Lord have mercy! I can't give you cyanine to kill your husband. That's against the law. I'll lose my license! They'll throw both of us in jail! All kinds of bad things will happen. Absolutely not!! You CAN NOT have any cyanide!" 

The lady reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of her husband in bed with the pharmacist's wife. The pharmacist looked at the picture and said: 

"You didn't tell me you had a prescription." 

That got her a big laugh and she followed up with, "The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment. Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it. 

The next day the kids came back and one by one they began to tell their stories. They were all the regular types of stuff; spilled milk and pennies saved and things like that. She came to Janie who was the last one to tell her story. 

"Do you have a story to share Janie?" 

"Yes ma'am. My daddy told me a story about my mommy. She was a Marine pilot in Desert Storm and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a flask of whiskey, a pistol and a knife. She drank the whiskey on the way down so the bottle wouldn't break when she landed and then her parachute landed her right in the middle of twenty Iraqi troops. 

"She shot fifteen of them with the pistol until she ran out of bullets, killed four more with the knife before the blade broke and then she killed the last Iraqi with her bare hands." 

"Good Heavens" said the horrified teacher. What did your daddy tell you was the moral of this horrible story?" 

"Stay away from mommy when she's been drinking." 

The house went crazy and Tanya left the stage to a standing ovation. As I watched her walk back to her table I wondered if I should attempt to say hello, but I couldn't figure out how to do it. I didn't want to suffer the embarrassment of being dismissed in front of four women I didn't know. I decided to take a chance. 

I called the waitress over and ordered a round for the five women at the table. When she delivered the drinks she told the women who had sent them over all five women looked over at me and two of them waved thanks and then they went back to talking. I really didn't expect anything, but I had hoped that Tanya would have shown some sign of recognition. It didn't happen so I finished my beer and got up to leave. 

I was almost at the door when I heard, "Frank? Wait up Frank." I turned to see Tanya coming toward me. I stopped and when she got to me she handed me a piece of paper and said: 

"Call me." 

She turned and went back to her group. I looked at what she handed me and saw that it was a piece of a bar napkin with a phone number on it. I looked back at the table and saw four women looking at me with what I could only believe was astonishment on their faces. Tanya sat back down with them and it looked like the other four were all trying to talk at once. I turned and went home. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I woke up in the morning the first thing I saw when I got out of bed was that piece of bar napkin sitting on the dresser with all the rest of the stuff I'd taken out of my pockets before I'd gone to bed. 

There wasn't any doubt but that I was going to call Tanya, but when should I do it? I doubted that the number was her work number; the question I had was what number was it? A home land line or a cell? Should I wait until the evening and possibly end up playing telephone tag if it was a home phone and she wasn't there? Or should I call right away and possibly catch her before she went to work? If it was her cell and she was up and already on her way to work would she answer it? Or was she one who wouldn't talk on her cell while driving and let the call go to voice mail? What if she didn't drive to work and took the bus? Would she answer it or prefer not to because she didn't want to talk with a bunch of strangers around? 

As I stood there looking at that piece of paper while busily over-thinking things something my dad used to say when facing difficult decisions came to me. "No guts, no glory." I walked over to the bedside phone and dialed the number. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

She hadn't lost whatever it was that drew me to her. My heart beat faster as she walked toward me. I stood up and offered her my hand when she reached the booth. 

"So good to see you Frank. I'm delighted that you asked me to lunch." 

"The pleasure is all mine Tanya." 

She gave me a big smile when I said that and then she slid into the booth across from me. 

"So what have you been up to since I last saw you" she asked. 

"Working and trying to live the good life. You?" 

"Working and trying to climb the corporate ladder." 

"I seem to remember that you moved to the west coast when you graduated." 

"I did and after a couple of years and a promotion or two I took a promotion that brought me back here." 

"Been back long?" 

"About three weeks. You married Frank?" 

"Was. Not anymore. You?" 

"Never took the step. Too locked into my career to find time for it and to be honest most of the men I met and dated tuned out not to be worth a second look. Certainly not worth giving up my career for." 

We got into talking about careers for a bit over lunch and when the plates were cleared away she said: 

"Since you invited me to lunch I'll invite you to dinner. You free tomorrow night?" 

I did have plans, but they went instantly out the window and I said I had nothing going on. She gave me her address and I told her I would pick her up at six. She gave me a thousand watt smile and told me she would see me then and we both went back to work.  

===

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Friday I was at Tanya's at ten to six and I sat in my car until two minutes to six and then I went up and rang her doorbell. The vision that opened the door took my breath away. 

Over all the years in school that I yearned for Tanya I'd never seen her look the way she looked when she opened her door. Four inch 'come fuck me' pumps, mini-skirt and a blouse that showed enough cleavage to get lost in and that thousand watt smile. 

She was dressed to build hard ons and I knew that it wasn't accidental. I wanted to drop to my knees and beg her to be mine and I could tell that she knew it. I had to ask myself why? 

Nine years of smiling sweetly at me as she turned me down time after time and now she was deliberately trying to entice me? Why? "Shut the fuck up!" a part of my brain was screaming at the part doing the wondering. "Take it and run. Thank whatever gods that be that you are even here." 

I offered her my arm and said, "Your chariot awaits my queen" and she laughed, took my arm and I escorted her to the car. I asked where to and she gave me the name of a trendy restaurant and told me there was no rush as our reservation wasn't until seven. 

We made small talk on the ride to the restaurant. The usual stuff like "Have you seen so and so since you've been back" and "Have you kept in touch with any of our classmates" and she asked if I'd gone to the five year reunion. I told her that I didn't go and she told me that she had wanted to go, but was in Italy at the time. 

When we got to the restaurant I checked us in with the hostess and told the girl that we would be in the bar when they were ready for us. We found an empty table, sat and ordered drinks and when they came and after we had taken our first sip Tanya said: 

"You are dying of curiosity aren't you?" 

I looked into her smiling face and said, "I can barely contain myself from shouting out "Why, why, why?" Nine years of being pretty much dismissed by you and now you are, for lack of a better way of putting it, coming on to me? Of course I'm curious." 

"It is really very simple Frank; I want you to marry me." 

"You have got to be kidding me." 

"This isn't a joke Frank; I want you to marry me." 

To say that I was stunned would be a massive understatement. The girl I had pined for since the day I'd met her in the eight grade was asking me to marry her. I'd asked her for dates a thousand times between the day I'd met her until the day we graduated from college and she had never, not once, said yes. We had never even dated and here she was sitting across from me and asking me to marry her. 

Un-fucking-real!! 

I sat there with my drink halfway to my lips and stared at her speechless! Absolutely fucking speechless. She was smiling at me and she said: 

"Say something Frank. Don't just sit there; say something." 

I finally managed to get myself together and said, "Simple? You call that simple?" 

"I'll admit that there might be some details to work out, but it has been done many, many millions of times so the formula is pretty much down pat. License, blood tests and then the ceremony." 

"But we don't even know each other. God knows that for over nine years I tried to get to know you, but the bottom line here is that we just flat don't know anything about each other." 

"What's to know Frank? You're a boy and I'm a girl and we are of legal age. And don't even try to tell me that you aren't attracted to me. Don't forget I saw your face when I opened the door to you tonight." 

"I'll admit to that, but looks alone aren't enough as I very well know from my marriage to Nancy." 

Before I could go any farther the hostess came up to us and told us that our table was ready. As I walked slightly behind Tanya and the hostess I was looking at Tanya's ass move and thinking that if looks alone were enough I'd get us on a plane to Vegas that very night and have the deed done in a matter of days, but as I'd told Tanya in the bar I already knew that looks alone would not make a marriage. If I'd learned nothing else from Nancy I'd learned that. 

As soon as we were seated and had ordered I took the bull by the horns and asked: 

"Okay Tanya, just what is the story here? What is going on?" 

"I don't know what you mean." 

"Of course you do. I chase after you for nine years with absolutely no luck and then go four years without seeing you and suddenly after a forty minute lunch as our only date, if it could even be called that, you ask me to marry you. I might have been born at night, but it wasn't last night so what gives?" 

Her face lost it's smile and she said, "I just found out I'm pregnant and for reasons I don't want to go into right now I need to get married as soon as possible. I need to have a husband before I show and ideally it should happen so the date of the marriage and the arrival of the baby seem normal to people." 

"What's wrong with marrying the father of the child?" 

"I have no idea of who he is and even if I did I wouldn't marry the low life son of a bitch." 

"That brings up more questions that it gives answers and the one at the top of the list is why me?" 

"You bought me a drink that night at the Landing Strip." 

"How does that enter into it?" 

"I've only been back here a little over two weeks and I haven't met any guys I would consider. There were a couple who might have worked if I would have had the time to get into a relationship and get to know them well enough to ask them, but I don't have the time. I need it to happen now. The night you sent me the drink I recognized you when the waitress pointed you out. My immediate thought was that the guy who had spent so much time chasing after me might jump at the chance to be with me." 

"I might have jumped at the chance no questions asked if I hadn't already been married to a cheating spouse." 

"What does that have to do with this?" 

"Why after being married to a cheater would I want to marry a promiscuous woman?" 

"What?!! Where did that come from?" 

"From you. You've already said you are pregnant and don't have any idea of who the father of the child is. To me that indicates a level of promiscuousness that would make me doubt the long term fidelity of a relationship." 

"That's a pretty rotten thing to say about a girl you don't know a whole lot about." 

"Which brings us right back to what I said just after you asked me to marry you. We don't know each other and don't know anything about each other. What I do know about me though is that I'm not about to jump into the fire you might be after jumping out of the frying pan that was Nancy. And then of course there are those reasons that you don't want to go into." 

"Am I right in making the assumption that you are not against a marriage, but you won't go into it blind, deaf and dumb?" 

"No you are not. I wouldn't even consider thinking about it until I knew everything about it that there was to know." 

She gave me a long look and then she shrugged and said, "I had hoped that after dinner we could have gone for drinks and dancing, but I guess the mood for that is shot. I don't want to discuss my situation out in public so if you will take me home I'll put on a pot of coffee and tell you the whole sad story." 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

We made the trip to her place in silence and when we were inside her place she told me to have a seat on the couch and she went into the kitchen to make the coffee. 

I looked around the room and wondered why I was even there. I should have walked her to her door, kissed her on the cheek and then gone on home. But curiosity and the fact that I had crushed on her for so long drew me. I was remembering all the times she had turned me down when I heard her say something. 

"What?" 

"I asked if you used cream and sugar." 

"Just cream." 

She went back into the kitchen and returned carrying a tray that had a carafe of coffee, two cups and a small pitcher of cream. She set the tray down on the coffee table in front of the couch and poured us both a cup. 

"I'll let you do your own cream" she said as she sat down in the easy chair across from me. I fixed my cup, took a sip and then looked at her and waited. 

"It isn't a pretty story" she said, "and I don't come off looking too bright, but the plain facts are I was gangbanged at a promotion party. I don't know if I was drugged or I was just too drunk to know what I was doing. I don't know if it was rape or not. I do know that when it was over I was between a rock and a hard place. Two of the men involved were related to my boss who was the owner of the company. One was his oldest son and the other was his nephew. 

"If I would have hollered rape and then gone to the hospital for a drug screen my career would have been over. I had busted my ass to climb the ladder and I had earned my promotion to district manager twice over. I made the decision to put the night behind me and chalk it up as one of life's hard lessons. 

"It wasn't easy because four of the seven worked with me and they figured that since I done it once they could get me to do it again and they kept after me. I kept shutting them down, but it didn't stop them from keeping after me. I couldn't complain to management and claim sexual harassment because the gangbang would end up being brought into it. 

"Fortunately, for me anyway, the district manager in the office here had to leave the company for personal reasons and I was asked if I would be interested in relocating and taking the position. It was a no brainer for me. I made the move and the day after I got here I found out I was pregnant." 

"I don't see the problem. Being an unmarried single mom is almost common in this day and age." 

"That brings me to the other thing I didn't want to get into. My family is about as straight laced as you can get. Unmarried and pregnant would get me disowned in a heartbeat and I know this for a fact. It happened to my sister and outside of me no one in my family has spoken to her in over six years." 

"From a purely personal standpoint they don't sound like people that I would want to have anything to do with anyway. I could maybe see a father being an asshole, but a mother who would turn her back on the child she carried for nine months? And then raised? She must be a real piece of work." 

"I don't want to go there. Suffice to say I need to stay on the good side of my parents." 

"Why? You are a grown up now. An adult who can make your own choices and live your life the way you want." 

"This isn't going to put me in a good light, but I am a bit greedy. My parents are extremely wealthy and I stand to inherit quite a bit when they pass." 

"So you are willing to marry someone you don't know all that well just to get a couple of hundred thousands?" 

"No Frank; I'm willing to do it for six to ten million." 

"You have to be shitting me!" 

"Not at all Frank; not even a little bit." 

"You do have other options. You don't have to have the kid. Have the procedure and your family will never know." 

"I can't do that Frank. I may be a bit greedy and sometimes not to bright, but I can't get rid of something that is now a part of me." 

She looked at me quietly for several seconds and then asked, "Could you do it Frank? Get rid of a life you helped create?" 

"It would never get to be my choice Tanya. If it were mine I would argue against it, but the ultimate decision gets to be made by the woman. It is her body so it gets to be her choice." 

"There you go. I choose to have the child." 

"Even though you might not be able to get a husband and end up losing your inheritance?" 

"I said I was a bit greedy Frank, but I'm not fanatical about it. Sometimes hard choices have to be made and you have to live with the consequences. So how about it Frank? Want to help a girl out?" 

"What would be the mechanics of it? 

"What do you mean?" 

"A year? Two? How about the form of the divorce? What kind of prenuptial agreement to keep me from being raped in the divorce? Things like living arrangements? How to behave in social situations? What kind of front do we put up?" 

"Why are you talking divorce when we aren't even married yet?" 

"Don't pretend to be dense Tanya. It is a marriage of convenience. A marriage in name only. There is no love or affection involved here. It isn't even a business deal. There is nothing in it for me other than doing a favor for an acquaintance." 

"Nothing in it for you?" she said as she stood up and stripped. She stood there naked in nothing but thigh high stockings and high heels. "You call this nothing? You chased after this for years Frank and I saw the look in your eyes when I opened the door to you when you got here. You going to turn it down now that you have a chance? And what's this crap about living arrangements? If we get married it will be a real marriage. 

"If it will ease your mind to have a pre-nup write one up and I will sign it, but I'll tell you right now I'm as much against divorce as I am against abortion. Any divorce that happens will be because you went for it not me. There will not be separate rooms or separate beds." 

As she talked I stared at the near naked woman and the sight had the predictable results. She noticed and said: 

"I see part of you doesn't find the idea all that repulsive." 

She walked over to me, bent and rubbed the lump in my trousers and said: "Come on Frank; follow me into the bedroom and let me show you what's in it for you." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was an exhausting night and we ended up falling asleep snuggled up to each other. I woke up in the morning to the sound of the shower. I debated joining her, but decided not to. 

I dressed and went to her kitchen and found that she had the same make of coffee pot that I did. I rummaged around until I found the coffee and filters and then I got a pot started. I saw she had bacon and eggs in her refrigerator so I pulled them out, found the frying pans and started to build a breakfast. I fried the bacon and then as I scrambled the eggs I thought back on the night. 

I know that earlier I'd told myself that if looks alone were enough I'd have us on the next flight to Vegas and a quick wedding with an Elvis impersonator presiding, but I had known that looks weren't enough. But looks and the sex we'd had last night could do it. Tanya had been damned near insatiable and she had done things with me that no other female had ever done. 

She had let me cum in her mouth and no other girl had ever done that for me. Not even Nancy. Nancy gave a mean blow job, but she would never go all the way. Tanya did and she swallowed. Another thing I'd never done was anal. I'd always wanted to try it, but never had a girl who would allow it. Nancy had flat out told me that she would leave me if I even tried it. If I'd known how we were going to end up I would have just taken it and watched her go. I didn't even have to ask Tanya. She asked me! 

We started out missionary, switched to doggie and then went sixty-nine to get me ready to go again. I was on the bottom so when Tanya got me hard she just scooted forward and took me in reverse cowgirl. After a bit she turned and settled into cowgirl and when I got to where I had to get off I rolled her onto her back and finished. 

We rested a while and then she said, "I'll get you back to standing tall and then I want you to take me in my pooper. Will you do that for me?" I asked her if she was sure and she said, "I want you to know how far I'm willing to go to make things worthwhile for you." She was tight, but she had KY and she talked me through it. I have to admit that I liked it. I liked it a lot. 

As I added a handful of cheese to the scrambled eggs I was giving some serious thought to what Tanya had asked me to do. She came into the room I told her that the coffee was ready and breakfast was almost done. 

"Nothing fancy; just bacon and scrambled eggs with some cheese." 

"You're hired. When can you start?" 

I knew she was kidding and meant that I was hired as breakfast chef, but I decided to take it a step farther. 

"Depends on how fast we can get the legal stuff out of the way." 

"Legal stuff?" 

"Yeah. Stuff like the prenuptial agreement, the license and blood tests and lining up someone to perform the ceremony." 

"You'll do it? You aren't joking are you? You will really do it?" 

"If you are willing to meet certain conditions." 

"Conditions? What are they?" 

"First and foremost is a pre-nup that will protect me when the marriage ends. Next is a written agreement that will penalize you monetarily if you cheat on me while we are married." 

"I don't understand. Isn't that what the pre-nup is for?" 

"No. All the pre-nup is going to say is that if the marriage ends, no matter what the reason, both parties walk away with what they brought into the marriage and what they acquired jointly will be split evenly. The penalty agreement will see to it that I get a bonus for putting my life on hold for you only to have you go out and cheat on me." 

"I still don't understand. Why are you already thinking of me cheating on you and we haven't even gotten married yet." 

"Why would I expect you to stay faithful? We wouldn't be getting married for love. It is only a marriage of convenience. A way for you to stay tight with your family. You know nothing about me and after living with me for eight or nine months you may decide that you don't even like me. After the baby is born you might start looking for a replacement; someone more to your liking. 

"I'll say right now and up front that I can see it happening and I'll also say up front that I have no problem with it as long as you are honest with me about it. What I will have a problem with is you doing your looking behind my back. If you do that you are bound to be found out. Even if it isn't by me it will likely be someone who knows me or who knows of me. The word will get out and I will have people looking at me and thinking all kinds of things about me from I beat you or cheat on you and you are getting even with me to I'm no good in bed and you are getting your satisfaction elsewhere. 

"When I found out these things, and eventually I would, I would have to suffer the embarrassment and humiliation of dealing with the people who knew. The penalty agreement wouldn't make it go away, but it would definitely help assuage the bad feelings." 

"So how much would this penalty be?" 

"See my worry here? We aren't even together yet and you want to know what it is going to cost you." 

"Don't be stupid Frank. I need to know so I can tell the attorney what to put in the agreement." 

"I'll leave the amount up to you. You put in what you feel it should cost you if you cheat on me." 

"So, pre-nup and penalty agreement. Any other conditions?" 

"Two more. In public you will treat me as any loving wife would treat her husband." 

"No problem there since I would do that anyway. What's the last one?" 

"That I get at least two nights a week like the one I had last night." 

"Only two? Was I that bad?" 

"You were astounding." 

"Then why only two?" 

"Back to the beginning. We both know that this is a marriage of convenience. I'm giving up my freedom and to play it right I won't be able to go out and date and see to my sexual needs so I need to make sure that I lock them in ahead of time. Once again I need to point out that you might not even end up liking me enough to want to have sex with me. This last condition is to insure that whether you want to or not you will. The 'at lease two' is a minimum. It should go without saying that I will take as much as I can get." 

"There isn't any way I could give you a legal document that will cover that. Besides, an agreement like that couldn't be enforced." 

"Doesn't need to be in writing and enforcement is simple. You agree to the condition and I hold you to it. You don't honor the agreement and I simply go public about the marriage and the reasons for it and the people that you wanted to hide things from would know what you didn't want them to know."  

===

When I finished I could tell from the look on her face that things weren't going as she had expected (or hoped) so I asked: 

"Do we have a deal?" 

"She looked at me for a bit without saying anything and then she said: 

"I don't have much choice. I need to get things done and done quickly. I don't have the time to date and find someone suitable that I could then ask." 

She gave me another few seconds of silence and then asked, "Why? Why are you even willing to do it?" 

"The simple truth is that I don't have anything better to do. That and the benefit of a sex life that will be regular and that won't cost me an arm and a leg." 

"You don't have anything better to do?" 

"After Nancy burned me I haven't had any interest in entering into another long term relationship. Mostly I just go to work and then go home. Friday and Saturday I go out to see what I can pick up to relieve my sexual tensions. I score some, but not enough. I can go through a couple of hundred a weekend on shows, dinner, drinks and dancing and still go home with a case of blue balls. This arrangement will save me money and give me the sex life I need." 

The look on her face made me curious so I asked, "You having second thoughts now?" 

She shrugged and said, "No; no second thoughts. It just isn't going the way I thought it would." 

"Just how did you think it would go?" 

"To be honest, given the way you chased after me during our school years I thought that you would happily jump at the chance and that would be it. I didn't expect the somewhat cold business like way you have taken. It hasn't put me off; I just didn't expect it." 

She paused and then said, "There isn't much we can do until Monday. We can apply for the license and do the blood tests Monday and I can see an attorney and get him going on the legal stuff. I think there is a three day waiting period so figure on next Thursday or Friday to tie the knot. That okay with you?" 

"That will give us time to work out some of the other things that need to be looked at." 

"Like what?" 

"Like where we are going to live. Do you own this place?" 

"No. It is a sublet. I've got it for two months while the owner is in England on assignment. It is only supposed to be temporary while I look for a place of my own." 

"I kept the house in my divorce so unless you have an objection that is where we will live." 

"I've no problem with that." 

"Next we need to see my parents. I need to introduce you to them and they are going to want to know why we are rushing into things so I'm going to tell them that I got you pregnant and we need to do it in a hurry." 

"What will they think of me? A woman having sex while not married?" 

"They won't think anything of it. Mom will be overjoyed that she is finally going to be a grandmother. I'll leave it to you as to how and when we break it to your family." 

"That is going to be the toughie. I can' use the "I'm pregnant and we have to get married" story. I think I'll tell them that we met at a party, fell head over heels in love and eloped to Vegas and got married. They won't be happy, but it will be a done deal. My mom will be pissed because she has been planning my wedding for years. I expect that she will get over it when she finds out I'm pregnant. She has been after me for years to get married and give her grandbabies." 

"I thought she already had one. Didn't you say that your sister got pregnant?" 

"She miscarried." 

"That's a shame. Does she live close?" 

"No. She moved to Georgia when my parents disowned her." 

"We will have to go visit when we get a chance. Do you have any plans for the weekend?" 

"I was going to go grocery shopping either today or tomorrow, but nothing other than that." 

"That can wait. We can use the weekend to move you into my place and then you can check out what I have in the pantry and fridge before you grocery shop." 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

And that is just what we did. By Sunday afternoon Tanya was moved in and was making out her grocery list. We hit Safeway and got what she wanted and then stopped at Outback for dinner. 

When we got home I called my mom and told her I was getting married again and asked when would be a good time to bring my bride to be over to introduce her to them. She told me to come to dinner on Monday. 

Monday we applied for the license and got the blood tests. Tanya saw an attorney and he told her he would have the paperwork ready for signatures on Wednesday. 

That evening we went to my parent's for dinner. Dinner went well and mom and Tanya seemed to get along great. I could tell from the way that dad looked at Tanya that he approved of my choice, but he did pull me aside and asked me if I knew what I was doing. 

"It hasn't been all that long since you divorced Nancy. Are you sure that this isn't an 'on the rebound' thing?" 

I think I surprised the hell out of him when I said, "I'm marrying Tanya for the same reason you married mom. She is pregnant and I'm stepping up to the plate." 

"How long have you known?" 

"Years and years. I saw your marriage license when I was digging through your desk trying to find something. Paper clips I think it was. Given the date on it and my birth date it wasn't hard for me to put two and two together." 

"Well then all I can say is that I hope you will be as happy as your mother and I have been." 

Mom got me alone and said, "She seems like a lovely girl. I hope it all works out for you. I'd hate to see you go through another divorce." 

"What will be will be mom. But you have to remember that it wasn't love that got us here - it was lust." 

"If you work at it love can come along and you can trust me on that." 

On the way home Tanya said, "I like your parents. They seem real nice." 

"They liked you too. My dad even told me to make sure I did everything in my power to hang onto you." 

"Are you going to?" 

"It is a two way street babe. It will take both of us." 

We had made love every night since our Friday date and if sex alone could make it happen we would end up celebrating our fiftieth anniversary. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The paperwork was ready Wednesday afternoon and we signed and had the signatures notarized. Friday at eleven we were married in a civil ceremony with my parents as witnesses and embarked on our new lives as a married couple. 

Surprisingly things went well. We learned all the things about each other that you usually learn during a courtship. We found that we liked the same foods, mostly the same music and the same authors. There were some areas where we didn't quite match. She was into chick flicks and I was more of an action thriller fan. She was an avid bridge player and I couldn't stand the game, but we both played pinochle, euchre and cribbage. We were both runners and fitness freaks and she joined the gym where I worked out. 

We had been married two days when she took me home to meet her parents. The looks they gave me when Tanya told them that we had run off to Vegas and had been married by an Elvis lookalike pretty much told me that I was never going to be in the top ten on their favorite people list. It was a stilted evening as you might guess and I was happy to get the hell out of there when Tanya said that we needed to be going. 

"They will come around when their grandbaby arrives" Tanya said. 

The next two months saw us having dinner or attending barbecues with relatives from both families so they could meet the bride and groom. At the affairs Tanya told everyone that she had gotten pregnant on our honeymoon. With the exception of her parents most of her relatives seemed to like and accept me and my side of the family took to Tanya and told me that I had struck gold. Strangely enough my parents and Tanya's parents got along great. Tanya was proven right and her parents did come around some when they found out they were going to become grandparents. I still wasn't in their top ten, but maybe I'd moved up to eleventh place. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

There were a few hiccups along the way. Tanya's job was taking up a lot of here time and there were a lot of late evenings and some weekend work. I got on her about it and she told me that she had worked her ass off to get where she was and she was going to keep working her ass off to make it to the next level. 

"I'm going to be their first female vice president." 

"How in the hell are you going to do that? You are going to have a kid to take care of." 

"Day care. I'll work until the baby is born, take a short maternity leave and then go back to work." 

I thought she was whistling Dixie, but she was going to do what she was going to do and I had no say in it. 

Regardless of the hours she worked and how tired she was when she got home Tanya never slacked off when it came to our love life. I was getting way more than the twice a week I had insisted on. We were getting it on four, five and sometimes six times a week and two-thirds of the time Tanya was the aggressor and nothing was off the table. Tanya especially liked anal and her oral was state of the art right down to and including swallowing. 

Our sex life did slow down some the closer Tanya got to her due date, but we were still averaging three times a week right up to the middle of her eighth month. At that point Tanya said no more until after the baby arrived and she was cleared by the doctor to have sex again. Well that wasn't exactly true. She still gave me blow jobs and I got her off with my fingers right up to when her water broke. 

She was at work when it happened and she took a cab to the hospital. She called me on her cell as the taxi hurried her to Saint Josephs and let me know what was going on. My office was only three blocks from the hospital and I was already waiting at the entrance to the emergency room when her cab arrived. While I was waiting for her to arrive I called both sets of parents and brought them up to date. 

When she got there she was rushed into delivery and after a four hour wait the doctor came out and told us mother and child were doing fine. We already knew from the ultra-sound that the baby was a boy and we had already picked out the name. My father in law was pretty much speechless when he and my mother in law went to the nursery to view their grandchild and found out that he had been named after my father in law. It was what Tanya wanted and I could not have cared less. I got a handshake and a thank you from daddy in law and a big hug from my mother in law which came as a huge surprise since it was pretty much the first time she had more than look down her nose at me whenever Tanya and I were around her. I think maybe I'm in seventh or eighth place now. 

My folks showed up about a half hour later and they oohed and aahed over the baby and I almost felt guilty that the child was not really mine, but I had signed up to play the roll so play it I did. 

They had moved Tanya to a recovery room and as soon as the nurse told us we could visit we all tromped in to visit her. She was lying there with little Jason Alexander in her arms and I swear that I had never seen a more beautiful sight in my life. Tanya smiled at me and held the baby out to me as she said: 

"Meet your son Frankie." 

I took little Alex from her and something happened. My figuring to be a pretend daddy went out the window as the baby's hand closed around my finger and gripped it. As he looked up into my face and gurgled I made a silent promise that I would be the best daddy he could hope for. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I picked Tanya and little Alex up at ten the next morning and took them home and once there I got them settled in. I'd taken the week off from work so I could take care of Tanya until she was able to get back on her feet, but that plan went quickly into the toilet. It seems that both grandmothers had gotten together and decided that it was up to them to take care of Tanya and the baby. I was pretty much chased out of the house by the two of them and I had no place else to go so I went back to work. 

One thing was certain. If the grandparents had their way Jason Alexander Dalton was going to be one spoiled rotten kid. 

The day after I brought Tanya home from the hospital Tanya woke me up with a blow job and when it was over I asked her why. 

"It will be at least six weeks before we can make love again." 

"Before I can make love again" she said, "But I have to get you off at least twice a week. That was the deal right?" 

"Given the circumstances I'm not holding you to that." 

"I'm holding me to it. Besides, I like giving you pleasure." 

I decided not to argue with her. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

The next two years slipped by. Tanya took four weeks of maternity leave and then the grandmothers went nuts when they heard Tanya was going to put Alex in day care and go back to work. No day care for 'their Alex' at least not if they had anything to do with it. They worked out a schedule where they would alternate keeping Alex while Tanya was at work. 

Professionally Tanya was doing well where she worked and had made the jump from district manager to regional manager and was now only one step removed from the vice presidency she was after. I was doing fine although I didn't have to fight my way up the ladder like Tanya had to. It helps when it is a family owned business. 

On a personal note I found out that my mother was right. Love did come along if you worked at it and I did. Things were going along great and then one evening Tanya came home from work and told me that she had a problem. A very major problem. 

One of the men who had taken part in her gangbang had transferred into her region and during their first meeting in her office he told Tanya that he wanted her to meet him at his motel to have a 'long lunch' with him as he put it. She told him to fuck off and die and he laughed at her and opened his briefcase, took out a folder and handed it to her. She opened it and found a dozen or so 8X10 photos of her being gangbanged. He then told her that she WOULD meet him at his motel or copies of the photos would find their way to me and copies would appear in every office in her region. 

"He gave me until tomorrow to decide." 

"I don't see a problem with it. Meet with him." 

"Are you out of your fucking mind?!!" 

"Of course not" and then I went on to explain what we were going to do. She smiled at me and told me it made her hot just thinking about it and then she suggested that we spend some time in the bedroom before going over to her mom's and picking up Alex. I thought that was a pretty good idea and so we did just that. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

His name was William Bagley and William was having trouble looking me in the eye. Maybe it had something to do with his condition. He was naked and sitting on one of our kitchen chairs. He was securely bound and only his right arm was free and he had a rag stuffed in his mouth. The chair was pushed up to the kitchen table and there was a pad of paper and a ballpoint pen in front of him. Also on the table were a soldering iron and a small butane torch. 

How did Willie come to find himself in that situation? Tanya had called him into her office and told him that there was no way she could take off for a long lunch as there was too much going on in the office at the time and she needed to be there to handle it. She also told him that there was no way that she was going to meet him at his motel. She would not risk being seen by someone who knew her. 

Then she told him that I was going out of town on business Tuesday and would be gone for three days and she would send Alex to her mother's for the night and that he could come over to the house. She set it up for Wednesday. That way she could be sure that I'd made my flight and wouldn't walk in on them. 

When Willie arrived Tanya was naked except for a pair of 'come fuck me' heels when she opened the door and Willie had laughed and said: 

"You slut! You want this as bad as I do." 

Tanya smiled at him and told him to come in. He walked and then fell to his knees when I came out from behind the door and nailed him in the kidneys with a baseball bat. I dropped the bat and put him in a choke hold until he passed out and then I stripped him and drug him over to a kitchen chair. I manhandled him onto the chair, secured him and then Tanya and I went into the bedroom and knocked off a piece. 

When we came back into the kitchen we found Willie struggling to get loose from his bonds. Tanya and I sat down at the table across from him and I said: 

"I'm afraid you have upset my wife Willie and I'm the kind of husband that hates to see his wife upset and does whatever is necessary to rectify the situation. What we are going to attempt to do here tonight is remove the reason for her being upset." 

I reached over and pulled the rag out of his mouth and he immediately started hollering for me to untie him. 

"Not going to happen Willie. Not until you have done what we require of you." 

"I'll have your ass in jail for this asshole." 

I stood and backhanded him and then stuffed the rag back in his mouth. 

"Here is the way it is going to go Willie. You are going to pick up that pen and write down where every picture you have of Tanya can be found and then you will write down the names of anyone else who has pictures of that night. You will do it or I will use the soldering iron to burn "Blackmailing Asshole" into your chest and then I will use the butane torch to roast certain parts of your body. Your choice Willie; the easy way or the hard way." 

He sat there and gave me a hard look and made no move to reach for the pen. I shrugged, picked up the butane torch and lit it. When I started to move toward Willie with the flame hissing he suddenly grabbed the pen and started writing. When he was done Tanya read what he had written. 

"According to this the only place he has pictures is on his laptop and he says that he is the only one who took cell phone pictures that night." 

"Do you believe him?" 

She shrugged. I took the rag out of Willie's mouth and said, "My bride isn't sure that you have been totally forthcoming Willie so I guess I'm going to have to apply some incentive." 

I fired up the butane torch again and started to move it toward Willie's foot. 

"I'm telling the truth damn it; honest to God it is all there." 

I looked at Tanya and she shrugged and said, "We know where to find him if he lied." 

I shut off the torch and said, "If you go to the police over this all it will get you is the jail cell next to mine. In case it slipped your mind blackmail is a crime." 

Tanya placed a digital recorder on the table, hit the play button and Willie's meeting with Tanya when they set up the evening played. 

"You do know that I don't want to do this right? The only reason it happened the first time is because the seven of you drugged me and then raped me." 

"So what if we did? You have no way of proving it." 

"Please don't make me do this. I really don't want to chance messing up my marriage." 

"I don't care if you want to do it or not. You WILL do it or I will ruin your reputation and make you the company laughing stock." 

I stopped the recording and said, "We don't need to waste time listening to the rest of the recording. There is enough on it to charge you so if I do go to jail so will you. Where is your laptop?" 

"In my motel room." 

While I entertained Willie Tanya took his keys, went to his motel room, got the laptop and brought it home. There were a total of twenty-one pictures on Willie's hard drive and I copied them onto a thumb drive and then deleted them off of his computer. It embarrassed Tanya that I saw them, but I needed to know a few things. I had her tell me who the men I the pictures were. 

I cut Willie loose and told him to get dressed and then I handed him his laptop and said:  

===

"If you lied and any of those photos show up three things will happen. One, the gangbang will be out in the open and I will see to it that the pictures I now have will get to your boss thereby exposing what you, his son and his nephew did to Tanya. He may not be too pleased to have his son and nephew called rapists. He might even fire you and see to it that you get a reference that will ensure you never get a good job again. 

"That ties in with the second thing. There is no statute of limitations on rape and Tanya will press the matter. True, it will be her word against yours, but her word will be backed up by the recording we have and you will be drug out into the publics eye. And don't think for one minute that she won't do it. Once you have put her photos out there for all to see she has nothing to lose in coming after you. 

"It is the third thing that you need to seriously consider. I will hunt you down and when I'm done with you you will wish that I had gone all the way and killed you. Do you understand me?" 

He looked away from me and said, "Yes; yes I do." 

He left and as we watched him walk to his car Tanya said, "Do you think that we really got all of the photos?" 

"No way of knowing, but I saw the look in his eye when I told him what would happen if any turned up. He believed me and I'm betting that if there are any he will destroy them" 

"And if he doesn't?" 

"You of all people should know that I am a man of my word." 

"I'm not usually into porn, but looking at those pictures has given me some ideas. Care to follow me into the bedroom?" 

She headed for the bedroom and I smiled and followed along behind her.  

===

I didn't have a clue. Not even a smidgen. One day I had a wife and the next day I didn't. 

I got a call from my wife at work and she told me that her sister was in trouble and she had to go and help her. She told me that the kids were at my mothers and I would need to pick them up when I got off work. She told me she would talk to me later and then she hung up. I didn't get the usual "I love you" just the click of the phone being put in its cradle. 

I didn't understand why I needed to pick up the kids up at my moms. The twins were fifteen and could have walked home from school so why were they at my moms which was twenty miles away? Oh well, I thought, I could get the answers when she called me latter. 

It made even less sense to me when I drove to moms and found out that Janet had picked them up at school and had driven them to moms. That made no sense at all. It was only a ten minute walk from the school to our house and the twins were old enough to take care of themselves until I got home. 

I asked the girls why their mom had brought them to their grandmothers and they told me that they didn't know. All she told them was that they needed to go to grandmas until I could pick them up. The girls did say that she seemed agitated over something and I put it down to her being worried about her sister. 

When we got home I told the girls (Janice and Jessica) that we were on our own and to figure out what they wanted for dinner and I'd get started on it as soon as I changed out of my suit and tie. They told me that they would handle dinner and for me to sit down and relax. 

The first inkling that I had that something was not right was when I went into the bathroom. Something was off. It just didn't seem right. It took a minute for it to register that none of Janet's things were there. Her hair dryer and curling iron weren't on the counter where they had always been. None of her cosmetics were there. I looked under the counter and saw that the shampoo and all of the other things she used were gone. 

I went into our large walk in closet and found that her side was completely empty. A quick check of her dresser drawers showed that they were empty also. Concerned, I got on the bedside phone and called Janet's sister Jasmine. I found out that not only was Jasmine not in trouble of any kind, but that she hadn't spoken to Janet in over two weeks. Next I called Janet's parents and they told me that they hadn't talked to Janet all week. As I hung up the phone I had to accept the obvious. Janet had packed up and left. 

I went all through the house looking in all the places where she might have left a note and found nothing. It finally occurred to me that Janet had taken the girls to my moms to buy her time to pack up and get out. My having to go from work to my mom's and then get home would have taken me an hour and a half. More if mom had asked us to stay for dinner. 

I went on line and checked out our checking and savings accounts and found that she hadn't touched them. She had told me that she would call me later so all I could do was wait for her call. 

The call didn't come. 

At ten to eleven I accepted that the call wasn't going to come. I spent the next fifteen minutes on the computer and did some internet banking. I had no idea if Janet had overlooked the money in her haste to leave or didn't intend to touch it, but I was going to make sure that if it was an oversight on her part she was not going to be able to correct it. After moving funds around I got on the phone and cancelled every credit card she was on and then I went to bed. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I didn't sleep at all that night, but still, tired or not, I had things to do. I woke the girls up a half hour early and told them I was taking them out to breakfast before dropping them off at school. 

Over breakfast at the Village Inn I told them everything that I had found and then said: 

"It looks like your mother got tired of us and ran off and left us." 

The two of them looked at each other and then Jessica said, "She has been acting funny for a couple of weeks. I wonder if that has something to do with it." 

"Acting funny? How?" 

"Stuff like hanging up the phone when we walk into the room. Not being home when we got home from school and maybe a half hour or so later coming home and rushing upstairs to take a shower. Twice she put the clothes she was wearing in the washing machine. No other clothes; just the ones she was wearing when she got home." 

I doubt the twins knew it, but the behavior they had just described was the behavior of a cheating wife. And I hadn't a clue. What is it they always say? The husband is always the last to know? 

I told the girls that we would have to make some changes. They were going to have to take over some of the things that their mother used to take care of. Cooking, cleaning the house, doing the laundry and things like that. I told them I would cook on weekends and be responsible for my bedroom and my home office. I softened things somewhat when I told them there would be a hefty increase in their allowances to go along with their increased responsibilities. 

I dropped them off at school and then I drove downtown and was waiting at the bank when the doors opened. I took care of what I needed to do there and then I went into work. Not being one to let grass grow under my feet I got on the phone as soon as I sat down at my desk and called several friends who had gone through divorces. I got recommendations on divorce attorneys and then I called one and made an appointment. 

Next I called Jasmine and filled her in on what I knew. I figured that sooner or later Janet would call her sister and I wanted to stay in touch with Jasmine so she would call me and fill me in on whatever she was able to find out. Next I called Janet's parents and brought them up to date and then I called my parents and filled them in on what was happening. My father suggested I go down to the police station and file a missing person's report just to cover my ass. 

"The longer she stays gone and no one hears from her the more people will wonder if there wasn't some sort of foul play. Put the cops on it up front." 

I saw the wisdom of that and I made it my next order of business. I used my lunch hour to go to the station where I was told I couldn't file a report for another twenty-four hours and that even then there wouldn't be much effort put forth in looking for her. 

"See it all the time. Wife gets bored with her lot in life and takes off. They usually come back. We will send out notices to hospitals and other law enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for her, but if there are no indications of foul play we have to assume that she just wanted to get away." 

That was pretty much what I was thinking so it didn't really come as a surprise to me that Janet wouldn't be a high priority with them. But I had put them in the loop and that is all I was looking to do. I wasn't all that sure that I wanted to find her anyway. With what the kids told me added to the fact that Janet didn't have a car and so had to have help in moving her stuff convinced me that she had run off with another man. Why would I want her back? 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

Janet had been gone two days when I met with the attorney. Most of what I got from him wasn't encouraging. We lived in what was called a 'no fault' state and everything we had would be split fifty/fifty. The divorce would be expensive because we would have to find her to have her served. There were private investigative agencies that did that kind of work, but they were expensive. His best advice was for me to do nothing until she came back or let some one know where she was. Or let Janet do the divorcing and if she didn't after a year I could divorce her for abandonment. After careful thought that is what I decided to do. 

The twins and I had another sit down meeting after I had talked with the attorney. I laid it out for them. We were on our own. The thing that was most surprising to me was that the twins didn't seem to care one way or another. It was a couple of months before I found out why. 

It seems like over the past year their mother had been distancing herself from them. The connection that they once shared with their mother disappeared and they thought that they knew why. Janet was already making her plans to bail out on us. 

A month went by and then two and no one heard from Janet. And then what my father had feared happened. Janet's Uncle Steve began making noises that his niece would never have just up and walked away like that and he pushed the police to look deeper into her disappearance, Uncle Steve's best friend was the Mayor so his pushing had some weight behind it. 

The police dug and dug and they found nothing. I mean that literally. They got a warrant and some kind of ground reading radar and went over my back yard. They found readings that they didn't like in two places and they actually dug up parts of the yard. They found bones! Apparently the people that owned the house before us had a dog and a cat that had died and they had buried them in the backyard. 

They interviewed the twins, all of Janet's relatives and my mother and concluded that Janet had taken off on her own. Uncle Steve wouldn't accept it and one day, after having several drinks to build up his courage, he came after me. He told me he knew I'd done something to his niece and he would beat it out of me if he had to. I turned my back on him and started to walk away and he hit me from behind. 

I fell and he moved to kick me, but I rolled out of the way and got to my feet. Uncle Steve didn't know it, but he had just fucked up big time. Months of being totally pissed at what Janet had done to me and the girls plus all the shit I'd been put through because of his pushing for an investigation had built up a huge amount of anger in me and Uncle Steve had pushed the button to release it. 

I tore into him with a vengeance. I put him in the hospital with a broken nose, two eyes swollen shut, two cracked ribs and a dislocated shoulder. And there wasn't shit he or his good buddy the Mayor could do about it. I had fourteen witnesses, one of whom was a minister and two who were off duty policemen, who saw Uncle Steve attack me from behind. 

To add insult to injury I pressed charges and unfortunately for Uncle Steve the District Attorney and the Mayor were old enemies and the DA had his eyes on the Governor's mansion and was in no mood to cut deals especially for a buddy of the Mayor. It went to trial Uncle Steve had a pretty good attorney who was able to convince the judge and jury that he was so despondent over his niece being missing that it affected his judgment. Of the four counts against him the jury only found him guilty of simple assault and the judge gave him the minimum penalty allowed. Uncle Steve spent sixty days in county jail, was put on a year's probation and given five hundred hours of community service. 

Uncle Steve's actions did have consequences for me. Neighbors and others I knew were distancing themselves from me. If I walked down the street neighbors who used to wave at me and say hi would abruptly turn and go into the house or garage rather than acknowledge me. I mentioned it to a close friend and he told me what he thought it was. 

"A long as the cops left you alone everybody believed that Janet just ran off, but when the cops started digging up your yard looking for a body their thinking changed. They started thinking that although the cops didn't have proof you did anything they must strongly suspect that you had something to do with Janet's disappearance or why would they go to the trouble of digging up your yard? Ergo, where there is smoke there must be fire." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Regardless of her uncle's actions Jasmine and I stayed on good terms and she became a surrogate mother to the twins. They went to her for advice they couldn't (or didn't want to) get from me. Jasmine took them shopping for clothes and spent some quality time with them. She even helped me organize and hold a Sweet Sixteen birthday party for them. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Between my parents, Janet's parents and Jasmine the girls never seemed to miss their mother at all. I, on the other hand, did miss her or rather I missed a service she had provided. To put it bluntly I missed getting pussy and I didn't know what to do about it. I know it sounds crass to dismiss the woman I'd loved for nearly half of my life as nothing more than a sperm receptacle, but that is all that she was to me in my mind any more. I felt nothing for her. The way she had abandoned me and the girls had killed all my feelings for her. 

I know that some people say that you can't just turn off love like turning off a light, but I did. All the love that had built up over seventeen years of marriage and the two years of going together before we tied the knot was gone. If Janet had shown up and knocked on the door (I'd long since changed the locks) and I opened it to find Janet standing there I would have spit in her face and then slammed the door shut on her. But I did need pussy and I needed to do something about it. 

So I did what I'd done since the day that Janet left. If it pertained to me and the girls I sat down and talked things over with them and the way I saw it they were involved. I was still married to their mother even though she wasn't around and I wasn't going to do anything that would make my girls think ill of me. After dinner one night I said: 

"I have a problem girls. Your mother is gone and is never coming back. Even if she did come back I would have nothing to do with her. My problem is that I need feminine companionship, but I am still married to your mother. I can't divorce her since I don't where she is to have her served. What I need to know is how you feel about it. How is my starting to date again going to sit with you?" 

Janice laughed and said, "We aren't kids anymore dad. You don't need to sugar coat it. By dating you mean that you need to get laid. Am I right?" 

Then Jessica giggled and said, "Now look at what you have done Jan. He's blushing. You've embarrassed him." 

"So what? If he wants to sound us out on things we have to have everything out there in the open. It saves us a step." 

I had to ask, "What do you mean that it saves a step?" 

"You leave this meeting knowing that we are okay with you dating - and we are both okay with it by the way - and then given the way you involve us in the decision making process when you get to where you want to take the dating a step farther you will call another meeting and ask us how we would feel about it. Jess and I are eliminating that step. Go. Spread pollen. Just know that like we know you will always be here for us we are always going to be here for you." 

I looked at the both of them and wondered about the differences between my generation at age sixteen and the current generation of the same age. No way when I was sixteen could I have had this conversation with either of my parents. I couldn't have had it at twenty-one. Then Jessica really shocked me when she said: 

"I even know who you could date and she would be perfect for you." 

Jan spoke up and said, "I told you to leave that alone Jess." 

"You did, but I don't remember you being appointed boss. Besides, I'm older than you and I wouldn't pay any attention to what you said anyway." 

"Only six minutes older." 

"So? Older is still older be it one minute or twenty." 

"Okay" I said, "Now you have my attention. Just who is this person that you want to bring up and that Jan doesn't want you too?" 

"Aunt Jas" Jessica said. 

"You can't be serious" I said. 

"Why not? She is beautiful and I know that she has been lonely since Uncle Fred died and I know that she likes you." 

"I like her too, but it just isn't possible." 

"Why not?" 

"Think of what it would do to her side of the family. Just imagine how your grandparents would take their son in law moving from one of their daughters to the other. Thanks to Uncle Steve's efforts they are a bit leery of me anyway." 

"You are imagining things dad. We have talked with them and we have told them how mom was acting over the past year. They would probably be happy if you hooked up with Aunt Jas." 

"Why would you think that?" 

"Without mom here you could decide to move and that would take their granddaughters away from them. If you were with Aunt Jas you would be more likely to stay." 

"Why would I move in the first place?" 

"You work for a big corporation dad. What if they offered you a big promotion and raise to take a spot in some other city or state? You might just take it to get away from here and all the bad memories here." 

And then Jan piped up with, "Aunt Jas probably needs to get laid as bad as you do. I don't think she has dated since Uncle Fred pasted away." 

Somewhere along the way my sixteen year olds had become thirty without me noticing it. I just shook my head and got up from the table and started doing the dishes. As I was scrubbing the pots I thought about Jasmine. If she wasn't Janet's sister I could have very well been interested in her. That prompted the thought "What the hell does being Janet's sister have anything to do with it? Why should Janet have anything to do with anything in my life? She had voluntarily taken herself out of my life so why should I have her in mind as I moved forward with it? 

Fuck the cunt!! 

I finished the dishes and then went on a mission. I scoured the house for anything of Janet's that she might have left behind and things we bought just because Janet wanted them and it all went out into the trash except for some pieces of furniture that I would give to Goodwill or some similar organization. Then I sat down and gave some thought to my situation. 

Where did a man of thirty-nine who was nineteen years removed from the dating scene go to meet members of the opposite sex? There were several single women where I worked and I had socialized with them some, but the few work place romances I'd seen hadn't really worked out and the aftermath, with both parties still working there, was messy to say the least. 

I gave some idea to looking into a discrete escort service, but discounted that. I need more than just physical release out of a relationship. I was actually considering giving Internet dating a try when things were more or less taken out of my hands. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

I got home from work and Jess told me to clean up as we had company coming for dinner and then she headed back for the kitchen before I could ask any questions. I went upstairs to take off my suit and tie and get into something relaxed. I was slipping on my penny loafers when I heard the doorbell ring. I came back downstairs and didn't see anyone in the living room so I headed for the kitchen. 

Our dinner guest was Jasmine and Jan was pouring her a glass of white wine. 

"Yours is on the counter" Jess said as she carried some dishes into the dining room. Jasmine came over and kissed me on the cheek and said: 

"Nice to see you Frank." 

"Always a pleasure to see you too Jas." 

Jan ushered us into the dining room and we sat down to eat. Dinner conversation centered around the girl's day at school and what they were up to with their friends and Jasmine talked some about her day at work. I kept quiet and just listened. When dinner was over Jess said: 

"Sis and I will do clean up. You old folks can retire to the living room and socialize." 

Jan threw in, "You can talk about what you are going to do on your first date." 

Old folks? First date? I looked over at Jasmine and saw that she was doing her best to try and keep a straight face. 

"I don't know if I can make it to the living room" I said. "This old guy can't seem to find his walker." 

"Just go" Jan said.  

===

Once in the living room Jasmine said, "Feeling like you've been ambushed Frank?" 

"Ambushed? Why would I feel that?" 

"I don't know. Maybe because that is just what it is." 

I looked at her questioningly and she said, "The girls told me about the sit down you had with them and their suggestion that you consider me. I told them that I thought it was a great idea, but all three of us knew you wouldn't take the step so we decided to make the first move and here we are." 

"You think it is a good idea?" 

"No Frank; I said that I thought it was a great idea." 

"Have you given any thought to how your parents are going to look at it?" 

"No I haven't because it doesn't matter. Did it matter to you when you went after Janet? You weren't what they wanted in a son in law and you knew it, but did it stop you from going after Janet? If you didn't care what they thought when it came to marrying my sister why would you care what they think when it comes to dating me. Besides; you have a club you can use to beat them into line if it becomes necessary." 

"I do?" 

"Of course you do. You have their only grandchildren." 

"I would never use the girls like that." 

"I know you wouldn't and the girls know you wouldn't, but my parents don't know it. So tell me Frank; what are we going to do on our first date?" 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Dinner and a movie were first followed by dinner, drinks and dancing on the second. A day at the beach with the twins was third. The fourth was dinner and a movie again, but this time with a difference. Somewhere during the film I realized that we were holding hands. When it happened I didn't know, but once I became aware I didn't let go. On the previous dates I had gotten a goodnight kiss on the cheek, but that night I got my first goodnight kiss on the lips and I liked it. 

Over the next three or four dates the kisses got longer and longer and more and more passionate. I knew where I wanted to take things, but I couldn't bring myself to take the step. Given the circumstances I knew it was dumb of me. I did know that if Janet suddenly reappeared I wouldn't have anything to do with her, but I was still in the "I'm a married man and I shouldn't do this" mode. 

Since it was apparent that I wasn't going to make the move Jasmine decided that it was up to her. I arrived at her place one night to pick her up for our date and she answered the door in a bathrobe. 

"I lost track of time and I'm not ready yet. Get a beer out of the fridge and have a seat on the couch. I won't be long." 

I got the beer, sat down on the couch and I'd no sooner taken the first sip than she was back in the room. Without the bathrobe. She was naked except for a pair of high heels. She didn't say a word. She just walked over to me, knelt down in front of me and reached for my zipper. I reached to push her hand away, but she used her left to block my hand while her right pulled down my zipper. 

"Don't fight it Frank; I don't want to have to hurt you." 

She had trouble getting my hard cock (I did say she was naked right?) out to where she could get at it, but she managed it and all my resistance disappeared when her mouth closed on me. After that it was a very active evening as I made up for months of celibacy. 

The first time was too fast to suit either of us so we went again. And again. And still yet again. When it was over and we were lying on the bed cuddled up to each other I asked the question: 

"Why Jas? Why the initial ambush? Why did you want to date me in the first place? Why this tonight?" 

"Why this tonight? Because we both needed it. At least I know I did. It is my first time since Fred died. Why you? Because of who you are. I've known you for years Frank and I know what a good man you are. I've seen how you treated Janet and the girls and many were the times I wished that Fred was more like you. 

"I loved the man Frank, but he was a jerk. He cheated on me several times and each time I caught him he promised never again and I loved him so I always forgave him. You probably don't know this, but the accident itself didn't kill Fred. He died from loss of blood. When the fireman finally cut him out of the car they found his penis lying on the floor. The woman with him was giving him a blow job while he was driving and when they got hit by that delivery truck she bit his cock off and he bled out. The sad thing is that if he would have survived the accident I more than likely would have forgiven him again. 

"I don't want another Fred in my life. I want a man like you and I felt that I needed to make a move before some other woman got to you. I have five months to convince you that the two of us can make a go of it and tonight was the first step in locking you in." 

"Five months?" 

"That is how much longer you have to wait before you can divorce Janet for desertion and abandonment." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next four months flew by and Jas did her absolute best to 'lock me in' as she put it and I had to admit that it was working. Her parents were a little cool to the idea of Jasmine and me becoming a couple, but George and Martha got over it pretty quickly when the kids let them know just how much they were looking forward to Jas becoming their stepmom. 

With two months to go before I could file I finally convinced Jas to move in with me. The reasoning was simple and made perfect sense. Jas was either at our place or the twins and I were at her place all the time so why waste the money on maintaining to separate households and waste all the time running back and forth between the two. Jas moved in and rented out her place. 

We moved her into the guest bedroom thinking it would be better not to be too intimate in front of the girls. We over looked the fact that the twins were sixteen going on thirty and one evening we came home from an evening out and found that Janice and Jessica had moved all of Jasmine's things into my bedroom. When we saw what they had done we pretty much shrugged and accepted it knowing that it was a fight we wouldn't win. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

One month before I would have been able to file disaster struck. The police had not been actively pursuing Janet's disappearance, but it was still on the back burner. They still had notices out to other law enforcement agencies, hospitals and other places where Janet might turn up. One of those places was the Department of Motor Vehicles which was the agency that handled driver's licenses. 

The agency notified the police department that one Janet Mason had surrendered her license when applying for a new one in Detroit, Michigan. The police contacted the Detroit police and asked them to verify that the woman who had surrendered the license was the Janet Mason on their missing persons list. It turned out that it was indeed my missing wife. 

I saw my attorney and got the bad news. 

"Now that we know where she is we have to have her served and it becomes your standard divorce action." 

"But why? She still deserted and abandoned the marriage." 

"It is a matter of legal rights. She has the right to know that you are attempting to divorce her and the right to contest it if she so desires." 

"So what happens now?" 

"We file the paperwork with the court using abandonment as grounds and then we have her served and see what she does. She has thirty days to answer. If she doesn't get an attorney and contest it the divorce will go forward and the only changes will be the additional fees to have her served and another three months to wait until the divorce is final. If she does contest it I have no idea of how long it will take." 

"Why would she contest it? She took off and no one has heard from her since. She obviously doesn't care about the marriage, me, her children or the rest of her family." 

"All I can tell you is that she has legal rights and has to be given the opportunity to exercise them if she so desires." 

I left his office cursing the legal system. Why the hell did I have to jump through hoop after hoop to get rid of someone who obviously didn't want to be here in the first place? 

When I got home I gave Jas and the girls the bad news and Jan said, "So what? It is only another three or four months and you've managed to go a year without resolution. What's another ninety days?" 

Then Jas said, "There has been another interesting development. When you called mom and dad and gave them the information you got from the police dad promptly called the airline and got a ticket. He left for Detroit at two this afternoon." 

"Shit!! I didn't need to hear that." 

"Why not?" 

"What if he talks her into coming back with him? The bitch is gone and she needs to stay gone. I can't see any thing but problems if she comes back." 

"I doubt that she will come back" Jas said. "She has no interest in anything here. She never even made an attempt to let her parents know she was okay. I think all that will come out of this is that dad will come back and tell us why Janet did what she did. Assuming of course that she tells him." 

"It may come as a surprise to some, but I don't care why she did it. The only thing that counts is that she did do it." 

"I'm not with you on this one pops" Jessica said. "I would very much like to know why my mother valued me so little that she could just walk away from me without a word." 

"I'm with Jess on this dad. I'd really like to know the answer to that." 

I just shrugged and prayed that their grandfather would come back alone. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

He was back two days later and whatever gods had been listening when I prayed he would come back alone decided to cut me a break. George did come back alone. Alone and bitter. 

Janet would not talk to him. 

When she answered his knock on her door and saw who it was she closed the door in his face and wouldn't open it again. He pounded on the door and demanded she open it and talk to him, but she never did. After five minutes of knocking and yelling he heard the garage door opening and a couple of seconds later Janet backed out of the garage and drove away like a bat out of hell. It took several seconds for George to realize that he could go into the house through the garage and wait for her to come home, but he wasn't quick enough and the door closed. 

He got in his car and pulled it into the driveway and parked it in front of the garage door to block it and then he settled in to wait her out. An hour later a Dodge Ram pulled up in front of the house and a guy covered in tattoos got out of it and walked to George and told him to get out of the driveway so he could get into his garage. 

George told the guy that he was Janet's father and he wasn't going anywhere until he had talked to Janet. The guy said he knew who George was because Janet had called him. He told George that Janet didn't want to talk with him and that she wasn't going to come back home until George was gone. The guy told George he had two minutes to get out of the driveway or he would be calling the police and charge George with trespassing. 

While the guy was talking to George another tattooed guy showed up in a Ford F- 250 and came up to George's car and said Janet had called him and then he asked the first guy if he needed any help in getting rid of George. He said that Janet had told him she wasn't coming home until George was gone and then he said: 

"We got to get rid of him. I've been horny as hell all day and tonight it is my turn." 

When George heard that he gave up and left. 

"Both guys were ten to fifteen years younger than Janet" he told us, "And it was obvious from what the second guy said that Janet was having sex with both of them. As far as I am concerned my daughter is dead to me and I don't care if I ever see or hear from her again." 

Janet was served and she didn't respond so four months later I was single again. 

For almost a week. It took that long to get the license and blood tests out of the way. Jasmine and I were married in a civil ceremony with only Jan and Jess as witnesses. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

A lot of things happened over the next fifteen years. Jas presented me with a ten pound three ounce future linebacker we named Jeffery and two years later Jason joined us. 

The girls went off to college, met the boys they would eventually become my sons in law. Jess was the first one to make me a grandfather although she only beat out Jan by three weeks. 

George came down with cancer, but he lived long enough to see Jean, his first great granddaughter, but he was gone before Jan had John. 

Martha passed away four months after George. She went quietly in her sleep. She just hadn't wanted to go on without George. 

Jess gave me one more grandson when she had Jeremy (yes, the family did have a thing for J names) and then both girls apparently decided they had enough kids. They didn't tell me that, but at a barbecue at Jan's place one Saturday I overheard Ben (Jan's hubby) telling Ralph (Jessica's) about the discomfort he felt after his vasectomy. 

"But it goes away in a couple of days so don't sweat it." 

There was one more chapter in the story. It was a Wednesday and almost thirty years to the day since Janet had left when Jessica's doorbell rang. She answered it to find her mother standing there. Before Janet could say a word Jess shut the door in her face and locked it. Janet rang the bell and knocked on the door for five minutes before giving up. 

Jess watched from her living room window as Janet walked down the street carrying two suitcases. She was never heard from again.  

===

Debbie was a slut. She'd been one the entire time I'd known her and that had been almost ten years. Since the eleventh grade. For some strange reason known only to God my wife Tammy and Debbie have become best friends. 

Even though Debbie was a round heeled slut I'd never fucked her. Not that I didn't want to because the girl was hot! Seriously hot!! But just before I turned sixteen my dad sat me down and talked about the facts of life. Not the birds and bees talk, but about life. The good, bad and the ugly and I listened because I figured dad knew what he was talking about. 

During that talk I found out that dad and mom got married because they had to. Dad had gotten mom pregnant and when the families found out they forced the marriage on my parents. 

"You know that I have never bad mouthed your mother in front of you, but in order for you to understand where I'm coming from I'm going to have to do it now. Your mother was a slut! To be honest about it that is why I was with her. I was a horny guy and your mother was easy pussy. I knew she was a slut, but I didn't care because I was getting laid when most of the guys my age weren't. I wasn't thinking steady girlfriend let alone marriage. All I was thinking was pussy. 

"Oddly enough your mother stopped fucking other guys when she started fucking me so when she hit me with the pregnancy shit about four months after we started playing there was no question that you were mine. I dropped out of college and her father got me into the tool and die program at Kelsey. 

"I guess I was a little naïve. I thought that once she got married your mother would change into a housewife and a mother and for a couple of years she did. But there is a saying that "Once a slut always a slut" and the saying proved true where your mother was concerned. 

"It was three years after we married and I was working the swing shift. I was turning a piece of stock on a lathe when the piece shattered and a chunk of it flew into my arm. They ran me to the hospital where they removed the piece, stitched up my arm and sent me home. I walked into the house and found your mother in bed with one of my so-called friends. He jumped out of bed, grabbed his pants and bailed out the bedroom window. 

"There was a lot of crying and begging. She had gone out with your Aunt Ruth and a couple of girlfriends and they had done a lot of drinking and I let her convince me that he had taken advantage of her while she was drunk. We worked by it, but six months later I caught her again. There was the same begging and pleading as the first time, but that time I kicked her out of the house. Then both families went to work on me and I got weak minded and took her back. One year later I caught her again and tossed her out again and again both families went to work on me to take her back. I got some backbone that time and told them that she wasn't coming back into my life and if they didn't butt out they would be out of my life too. 

"Three months later she left town with some guy she met in a bar. One year later I divorced her for abandonment. A couple of years after that I heard that she died of Aids some place in Nevada, 

"I've always told you that she died of cancer because I didn't think you should know the truth about your mom while you were so young. My point here is that you are at the stage in your life when your hormones are going to be running wild. Learn from your daddy. If a girl is too easy to get you don't want her. If a girl is too easy to get stay as far away from here as you can. Let some other poor dumb ass ruin his life over her." 

I listened to what dad said and I took it to heart. I did ignore some of it and a couple of times I did dive into a girl who was easy, but I always wore a rubber to protect me from disease and keep me from becoming a daddy. That is I did right up until Fred Ingram had to marry Barb Beeler because the rubber broke. After that easy pussy was off limits as far as I was concerned and that is the reason that I never fucked smoking hot Debbie. 

Why this discourse? To set the scene. Because Debbie was in my living room sitting on the couch. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was a Friday night and Tammy was spending the night with her sick mother and wouldn't be home until her dad got home from his business trip sometime Saturday morning. 

Tammy was gone and Debbie was sitting on my couch and doing her best to tempt me into sinking my cock into her. Why did I think that? Call it an educated guess. A guess based on the fact she was wearing a mini skirt, CFMs with four inch heels, a low cut blouse with no bra and sitting across from me on the couch, legs spread wide with no panties to cover her shaven pussy. And let us not forget that Debbie was a slut. 

As she made some meaningless chatter I let my mind wander back in time. Debbie had tried to get with me several times. We had dated a time or two and had it been pre-Fred and not post-Fred she would have been successful, but it was post-Fred and so I ducked her. Deb went back east for college and I stayed local and went to State. In my second year I met Tammy and by the end of our junior year we were engaged to be married. 

Debbie had a death in the family that necessitated her transferring to State to finish college. State had a requirement that you had to earn a minimum of thirty credit hours at State in order to get a degree from them, but Debbie had a very influential family and they had good lawyers and they managed to get that number down to twenty. Debbie was determined to graduate on time so during summer school before senior year and during senior year she carried that twenty hour load (I said she was a slut. I never said she was stupid). 

Tammy, my fiancée, had been a bit of a party girl during her freshman year and had let a couple of classes slip. Being determined to graduate with me she also took classes prior to our senior year. I spent that summer working as an intern at an engineering firm in Dallas and when I came home just before the start of senior year I found that in my absence Tammy and Debbie had somehow bonded and were fast friends. 

I'd be lying through my teeth if I said that it didn't bother me. I spent many a night wondering if Tammy had gone out with Debbie in the evenings. It had been a few years since I'd last seen Debbie and she could have changed, but I remembered her as a slut and remembering my daddy's words "Once a slut always a slut" I assumed that she still was one. The question was "Did she do it while Tammy was along with her?" Fuck yeah I was worried. I snooped and sniffed around, but I never found out anything that clued me in one way or the other. 

We made it through our senior year and Tammy and I married. One year later Debbie met Dennis Fraser and they married and Debbie seemed to change. Debbie and Tammy maintained their friendship and we had Debbie and Dennis over for barbecues and we went to their place for pool parties. 

About a year after Debbie and Denis married she was back to her slutty ways. I didn't know if Dennis knew, but I had doubted it and if Tammy knew she kept it from me. I only knew because I saw Debbie and Mark Mosser going at it on the back seat of Mark's Impala in the parking lot at The Landing Strip the night of Gene Greniger's birthday party. When I asked Mark about it later he told me that he'd caught her doing Phil Reed during a party at Mike Mattson's house and thought he might give her a try. Mark told me I should give her a go if I ever got the chance. 

"That's prime pussy hoss. Never had better and don't expect to ever find better." 

After that I kept a close eye on Tammy's doings whenever she was around Debbie. 

I finished my musings as Debbie said, "We've known each other a long time Frank and I have a problem that I need your help with." 

"I'll help if I can Deb. What's the problem?" 

"It is really, really personal, but you have known me a long time and you know how I used to be in high school and if I was still that way I'd do what I did then and just hook up with some guy. I can't do that now that I'm a married lady." 

"What is it that you need Deb?" 

"It is something that I need for my mental health Frank. I'm coming to you because I know I can trust you. I know what happens here will stay here." 

"Stop beating around the bush Debbie. What do you want?" 

"I want you to make love to me." 

"Are you nuts?! My God Deb; Tammy would kill me and Dennis would probably try to do it before Tammy could." 

"Tammy would never know and Dennis wouldn't do a thing even if he found out. He would be too busy cowering." 

"Cowering?" 

"That's what this is all about. Getting even with Dennis. Dennis had an affair with one of the girls he works with. It is over now and he doesn't know that I know. I'm not happy with him right now, but I do love the schmuck and I see no reason to ruin the marriage over it. The problem is that the way I wired I can't let him get away with it without doing something to even the score even if he never knows about it. I have to get even, but it has to be with someone who I know will keep quiet about it. 

"How about it Frank? I know you wanted me when we were in school and I know you are interested and have thought about doing me. When we have gone out clubbing with Tammy and Dennis and you danced with me I've felt that interest against my leg. Our secret Frank; just the two of us." 

Something here was rotten in Denmark. Debbie and Tammy were as close as sisters and there was not any way that either of them would betray the other. It suddenly occurred to me that Debbie was trying to set me up. She wanted to get me to fuck her so Tammy would have something to hold over my head. That meant that Tammy had either done something or was going to do something that she might need a "Get out of jail free" card for if I found out and the only thing I could think of that she might need it for was cheating. It would be what Debbie said she wanted for Dennis. "You did it so I can do it too." In my case it would be: 

"What? You can fuck Deb and I can't do somebody? Oh no Frank; no double standards in this house." 

Apparently Debbie did not know that I knew she was out playing the slut again. If Dennis was doing a woman where he worked it was probably because he was trying to get even with Debbie. Either Tammy was cheating on me and she wanted some insurance in case I found out or she was planning on cheating and wanted some insurance. I didn't know which one it was, but I was damned sure going to find out and the way to do it was to play along. 

"That is one hell of an offer Deb, but I can't take you up on it. At least not tonight. My cousin Lou is on his way over to help me reline the brakes on my truck. He should be here any minute now and then of course there is Tammy. I have no idea when she will walk in. I can't help you out tomorrow because I'll be helping my dad re-roof his barn. Call me some time Monday afternoon at work and we will see if we can set something up, but you need to make damned sure that Tammy never finds out about it." 

"Don't worry about that Frank. She'll never know." 

I walked her to the door and as I watched her back down the drive I didn't know which pissed me off more; The fact that my wife thought that I'd fuck around on her or that Deb thought I was a cheater like she was. 

When she was gone I headed for the garage. Two years earlier Lou suspected that his wife was cheating on him and he asked me for help in finding out. Lou wasn't handy with tools. Hand him one and he would find a way to hurt himself with it. I went on line and found out how to tap a telephone line and then set up a tap on his home phone line. It turned out that Martha wasn't cheating on him and when the dust settled I removed the tap and I still had the recorder. 

I got the tools I needed out of my tool box and twenty minutes later I had a tap on my home phone. I doubted that Deb would call Tammy at her mom's house and risk my mother in law overhearing something and Tammy was currently without a cell phone. She had dropped hers in the toilet (don't ask) and we had ordered a replacement from AT&T, but it hadn't arrived yet so any talking between Deb and Tam would have to be face to face or on our home phone. 

Once I got the tap in place I got myself a beer and went out to sit on the patio and drink it while I considered what to do if my loving wife was straying or was planning to. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Tammy wasn't home by the time I left for the golf course. I had a standing golf date with my cousin Lou and two friends. We had a ten o'clock tee time and I figured that Tam would get home around eleven or so and if the day was normal it would be four in the afternoon before I got home. Plenty of time for Tammy and Debbie to get together on the phone and if they didn't talk that day there was always tomorrow since I wasn't fibbing when I told Debbie that I was going to help my dad on his barn roof. By the time I left the house for work on Monday I should have some idea of what was going on. 

I had a good day on the course and almost shot par for the first time in my life, but a nine iron into the sand trap on the eighteenth hole screwed it up. It took me two shots to get out and I was so pissed at myself that I three putted and ended up with a three over par seventy-five. Still, not a bad day for a weekend duffer. 

Tammy was home when I got there and I was not surprised when she drug me into the bedroom. We were used to a pretty good love life and she had been gone for three days. We had an exhausting romp and then I took her out to dinner. When we got home she wanted to play some more so I of course obliged her. 

When she fell asleep I got out of bed and went down to check the recorder on the phone line. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi. It's me. I just got home. Frank is out playing golf so I'm home alone. How did it go?" 

"He was interested, but wouldn't do it because his cousin was coming over and he wasn't sure about when you might get home. He told me to call him at work Monday afternoon. The way he was looking at my girls and my shaved pussy did give him a boner so I'm pretty sure I'm going to get him. You really sure that you want to do this?" 

"I'm sure. I've never had a really big cock before and I want to try one at least once." 

"You do know that there is no guarantee that even if I do fuck Frank he will go along with the "You did it so I can too" scenario." 

"He will go along. He loves me and he knows that I love him. Things may be a little sticky for a bit, but we will be okay." 

"He's your hubby so I guess you know him better than I do, but the Frank I knew before he married you wouldn't go along with what you hope he will. I'm not trying to talk you out of it Tams, but you have a damned good man there. Are you sure that you want to risk it?" 

"It will be okay Deb. He won't find out. I just need a hook in case he does by some weird chance find out." 

"Okay kiddo, but it is on your head. I've tried to warn you." 

"Hey girl; this is all your fault to begin with." 

"My fault? How do you figure that?" 

"If you had hooked me up with a big cock or two before I married Frank I wouldn't have this curiosity to know what a big cock is like." 

"That's not fair Tams. I didn't even know Dennis back then and until I met him you had every cock that I had." 

"Still your fault. You should never have let me know how hung Dennis was." 

"That's on Dennis not me. He's had the hots for you since the day he met you and he has pushed and pushed for me to find a way to get the two of you together." 

"You get Frank to do you and Dennis will get his wish. Call me and let me know how Monday goes." 

"You sure you want to wait? Frank said that he would be gone all day Sunday to help his dad. That would give you all day to satisfy your curiosity while Frank isn't around." 

"No. I'd rather wait until next week. Frank said something the other day about possibly having to fly to San Diego for a training seminar next week. If he goes he will be gone a couple of days and that's when I want to do it." 

"Okay. I'll call you after I talk to Frank." 

I went back to bed a troubled man. If Tammy went through with her plan we were toast. I wouldn't live with a cheating wife. I'd grown up without a mother because of cheating and it was just something that I could not live with. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I spent so much time thinking of what I should do about the situation that it is a wonder that I didn't fall off the barn roof because my mind was elsewhere and not on what I was doing. As I drove home from dad's I knew what I was going to do. I was going to go at it head on. 

When I got home Tammy wanted to play before dinner so we did and then while she fixed dinner I went down into the basement and checked the recorder. Tammy hadn't talked to Debbie, but she had talked to Dennis. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi there sexy." 

"You shouldn't call here Dennis. What if Frank had answered?" 

"Deb told me that he would be gone all day." 

"What if there had been a change in plans? What if he were sill here?" 

"He isn't so what's the harm? I know he's gone because I'm parked at the end of the block and I saw him leave. I can be walking in your door in less than a minute." 

"No Dennis. It isn't going to happen until next week." 

"Come on sexy lady; you know you want to feel my throbbing eleven inches inside you. We can have today AND next week." 

"I said no Dennis. Yes I do want to feel it, but not until I have a few things in place." 

"Oh come on se..." 

"I said no damn it and no means no!" and she hung up on him. 

After dinner Tam wanted to play some more and I figured that I'd better take advantage of it since after Monday things would more than likely be a little frosty around our house. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Monday at work was pretty busy and I was pretty much on the go until lunch time. Work is only ten minutes from the house so at lunch time I made a quick trip home. The mail is usually delivered between nine and ten and UPS and Fed- X usually deliver our neighborhood in the morning. I was in luck. AT&T had sent Tammy's replacement phone UPS and the package was sitting on the porch. I grabbed it and headed back to work. 

Tammy wasn't allowed to take personal calls at work and without a cell she was limited to face to face with Debbie or the home phone. I guess Tam could have stopped somewhere and used a pay phone, but I just couldn't imagine Tammy in a phone booth talking about personal stuff. 

At two o'clock I got the phone call from Debbie. And after exchanging greetings I went straight at it. 

"We won't be getting together Deb. I know that your story about getting even with Dennis is bullshit because I know about you doing Phil Reed at Mattson's birthday party and I personally saw you go at it with Mark Mosser on the back seat of his Impala and I know of several others that you have done. I don't know what kind of game you are playing, but I'm not going to be one of the players. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks." 

I guess she didn't take rejection well because she hung up without saying another word. 

I beat Tam home by ten minutes and had opened a bottle of Merlot and was sitting at the kitchen table with two glasses poured when she walked in. She came in, saw the set up and asked: 

"What's the occasion?" 

"Just need to clear a few things up. Sit down and take a sip while I tell you a story." 

She sat down and I said, "I've misled you. Well, to be honest I lied to you. I told you that my mother died of cancer when I was a young boy, but it was a lie. I told it because I was ashamed of the truth. My mother didn't die of cancer; she died of Aids." 

I told Tam what my dad had told me and then I said, "I can not abide cheaters Tam. My mother cheated on my father and as a result I grew up without a mother. He forgave her twice, but when it happened a third time he kicked her out. I have no room in my heart for cheats. Why am I bringing this up now? Because I need to clear the decks so to speak.  

===

"Debbie paid me a visit Friday night" and I went on to recount what the visit was about and what was said. "It was all bullshit Tam. I don't know if Dennis is screwing around on her or not, but if he is it is to get even with her." 

I told Tammy what I knew about Debbie and Mark and Debbie and Phil Reed and then said: 

"Debbie was a round heeled slut in high school and she still is one and that is how I knew that the story she told me was absolute bullshit! That brings up the question of why would she come here and lay that load of crap on me. I'm not stupid Tam. I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but stupid I ain't! You and Deb are as thick as thieves and I do not believe that either of you would betray the other. That leaves me with the inescapable conclusion that you knew about her visit. I asked myself why the two of you would pull such a stunt and I came up with another inescapable conclusion. 

"You were setting me up. 

"You wanted me to fuck Debbie so you would have something to hold over my head and the only reason I could see for you wanting that was that you either did something or were planning on doing something that you felt that you might need a get out of jail free card for. That thought led to the question of what that might be and that brought me to my third inescapable conclusion. You have already cheated on me or you are planning to cheat on me. If I would have taken Deb up on her offer and if you had cheated and I found out you would have said something along the lines of "You did so you can't bitch at me for doing it too." 

"Not going to happen Tam. I won't live with a cheat. You are a grown woman and I can't tell you what you can or can not do, but I can tell you what I will do if I find out that you have cheated on me. I will toss you on the trash heap so fast that it will take your shadow a week to catch up with you." 

As I talked Tammy's face had gotten redder and redder. She was boiling mad and couldn't hide it. 

"How dare you speak to m..." 

"Can it Tammy" I said to cut her off. "I've already told you that I'm not stupid. No amount of bluster and indignation is going to change things. I've given you my position. What you do with the knowledge is up to you. I'm going down to Bud's Bar for a burger and a beer. That will give you some time alone to digest what I've said and make up your mind as to whether you want a life with me or not." 

I left the house and headed for the bar. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Damn! Wouldn't you just know it. The first person I saw when I walked into Bud's was Dennis. My natural urge was to walk up to him and smash him in the mouth, but of course I couldn't and I couldn't ignore him because of our supposed friendship. I couldn't let him know that I was onto him because that most likely give up the fact that I had a way of getting information and that would probably give away the phone tap. 

I sucked it up and went over and settled onto the bar stool next to him. We made small talk as we watched the Avs skate against the Red Wings on the TV hung above the bar. After a bit he bought a round and got up to leave saying that he had to get home before Debbie got pissed at him. 

He left and I wondered if Debbie would get pissed at him if he couldn't get it up for her. If he ended up fucking Tammy I'd do my best to fuck him and his package up big time. 

Around ten I called it a night and headed on home. When I got there Tammy was already in bed so I went down into the basement and checked the phone tap. 

"Hello?" 

"Hey girlfriend; the news is not good. When I called him he shut me down. He knew my story was bullshit because he knows I'm out screwing other guys." 

"It's worse than that. He figured out why and warned me that if I got caught cheating on him he would throw me out." 

"So what are you going to do?" 

"Not get caught." 

"Are you sure that's wise? If he is suspicious he is going to be watching you like a hawk from now on." 

"How is he going to find out? I'm always over at your place visiting anyway. The only people who will know will be you, Dennis and me and we sure aren't going to talk to anyone else about it. He will watch me on my girl's nights out and check on me when I'm away from home, but he won't suspect a thing when I'm over at your place. Maybe if I was out with you, but not while I'm at your house. He would know that I wouldn't do anything with Dennis being there." 

"Maybe. I can see where he wouldn't expect you to be doing anything while you are here. He wouldn't know that the fox was the one guarding the chicken coop. Are you sure that you want to take the gamble? You have a pretty damned good marriage and I know you love the guy and I have no doubts at all where his love for you is concerned. Are you sure that you are willing to risk it all just because you are curious about what a big cock is like?" 

"I wouldn't under any other circumstances, but there is no risk here, no risk at all in doing it at your place. Frank will know I'm visiting you and he won't even give a thought to Dennis. While Dennis is doing me Frank will be sitting watching TV and if he thinks of me at all it will be about you and me sitting at your kitchen table and swapping recipes or talking about some other female stuff." 

"And when you go home and he wants to make love how are you going to explain your looseness?" 

"That's the reason I don't want to do it until next week. Frank will be in San Diego for three days attending a training session. He leaves Wednesday morning and won't be back until late Friday or early Saturday and my period is due to arrive sometime Friday. I'll have plenty of time to get back to normal for Frank." 

"I hate to keep harping on this, but are you absolutely sure you want to risk your marriage just to find out what a big dick is like?" 

"If you are so concerned about my marriage why did you even tell me about how hung Dennis was. Why did you get him to take it out and show it to me when I laughed at you and said no way any one had a cock that big? You know how big a slut I was before I married Frank and you had to know how I would react to seeing that huge piece of meat. This is all your fault girl. You set it in motion when you told Dennis to take it out and show it to me. I'm just surprised that I didn't do it then and there." 

"Okay girlfriend; next Wednesday it is." 

There was more, but I had the crux of it. And what I had pretty much ended my marriage. I unhooked the recorder from the phone line and then went upstairs and into the bedroom and turned on the light. 

Tammy was asleep, but woke up when I started opening and closing drawers as I took her things out and started moving them across the hall into the guest bedroom. She sat up and said: 

"What are you doing Frank? What are you doing with my clothes?" 

"I'm moving you out Tammy." 

"Moving me out? I'm not going anywhere." 

"Oh yes you are Tam. You are moving to the spare bedroom until you can find a place to stay. Maybe Debbie will let you move in with her and Dennis. You'd like that wouldn't you? Being able to be around his big cock and all?" 

"Have you lost your mind Frank?" 

"Nope. Just found out that I have a whore for a wife." 

"How dare you talk to me this way?!" 

"Easy Tam. All I had to do was listen to you while you made plans to cheat on me." 

"Are you crazy?" 

"No, but you must have been if you thought you could get away with what you planned." 

I took the recorder out of my pocket, set it on the dresser, hit the PLAY button and then watched as her eyes got big and the color drained from her face as she listened to herself spell out her plan to cheat on me. 

I took her arm, pulled her off the bed grabbed the recorder and pulled her over to the guest bedroom. I pushed her onto the bed, set the recorder on the bedside stand and said: 

"This was recorded after I told you that I had zero tolerance when it came to cheating. You either didn't believe me or you didn't care. Either way you are out of here. I'll give you a week to find a place to stay and if you aren't out by then I'll carry you out and set you on the curb. A week from today is also trash pickup day and how fitting is that? You can get the rest of your stuff out of the bedroom while I'm at work." 

I walked out of the bedroom and went down to the kitchen, got a beer out of the fridge and went out onto the patio. I sat down and drank the beer while I calmed down. I was almost finished with the beer when Tammy came out and in a weak voice asked: 

"Can we talk Frank?" 

I stood up and said, "No we can't" and I got up and headed for the bedroom. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got up in the morning and went down into the kitchen Tammy was already there. She didn't look like she had gone to bed or slept all that well if she had. She looked up at me when I entered the room and said: 

"Coffee is made." 

I got a cup, added cream and then went outside to the patio to drink it while watching the sun come up. Tammy came out and sat down. She was silent and I just ignored her. After a minute or so she said: 

"Are you really going to throw me out? Without even talking to me?" 

"What is there to talk about? I made my position clear last night before I went to Bud's. You knew exactly where I stood when it comes to cheating. I hadn't been gone from the house thirty minutes and you were all ready on the phone with Debbie setting up a time to cheat on me. All I'm doing is dumping you before you have a chance to do it." 

"That's what we need to talk about. I wasn't going to do it. After hanging up I thought about what Debbie had said. She was right. I do have a damned good marriage and I do have a damned good man as a husband. I thought long and hard on it Frank and I decided that I had it too good to take a chance on losing it. By the time I'd worked it all out in my head it was too late to call Debbie back, but I was going to call her as soon as you left for work this morning and cancel. Honest to God Frank; I wasn't going to go through with it." 

"That's what you are saying now that I've caught you, but unfortunately for you I don't trust you any more. For all I know you are lying to me about changing your mind. The way it looks to me is that you are doing damage control and every thing you say is self serving. I don't trust you any more and I'm not inclined to waste the time and effort it would take to make sure that you didn't go ahead with your plans. 

"I go on too many business trips and I have no intention of spending my time away from home wondering if you are being unfaithful or not. And you spend too much time over at Debbie's. Time that you could be using to fuck Dennis. No Tam; you screwed the pooch when you made your cheating plans after I'd warned you. I can't trust you and I won't spend my life wondering where you are and what you are doing when I'm not around. 

"And it isn't just business trips. When I go over to help my dad I'm usually gone ten or twelve hours. When I play golf I'm away for five or six hours. Debbie and Dennis are only five minutes away so while I was gone what you could be doing would be on my mind and I just will not live my life like that." 

"I'll sever my relationship with Debbie." 

"You say you will, but if I'm not here how will I know that you aren't over there visiting? See what I'm saying Tam? I just do not trust you any more. I sat and listened to you lay out your plans to fuck Dennis while I was gone. I listened to you plan for every eventuality. You set the timing so my trip and your period would give you all the cover you needed. It was a deliberately thought out plan to hang horns on me. You just had to try a big cock. It didn't matter to you that you were a married woman who had taken vows of fidelity. Finding out what a big cock would feel like was more important to you than my feelings or our marriage. 

"We haven't even addressed the possibility that you would like big cocks so much that you would want more. It is a slippery slope Tam and once you set foot on it you have no idea where you will slide to." 

"You can't do this to me frank. You know that I love you." 

"Do I? Thanks to the phone tap I know that you love me so much that you were here being a slut just like Debbie while I was in Dallas staying true to you. From what I heard it is a wonder that you didn't welcome me home from Texas by giving me a venereal disease. Given what I heard on the recordings I'm wondering if you have been cheating on me all during our marriage. I think of all the nights that you went out on girl's nights out with Debbie and other girls and I wonder if you were cheating on me then. You can tell me that you never did, but why should I believe you. You say you will end your relationship with Debbie, but why should I believe you? You say that you changed your mind about screwing Dennis, but why should I believe you? You can swear on a stack of bibles that you will never cheat on me, but why should I believe you? After listening to you carefully plan to make me a cuckold why should I believe anything you say?" 

"Damn it Frank; you have to give me a chance. You have to give us a chance." 

"How can I do that Tam? I don't trust you. How can we hold together when I don't trust you; when I don't believe a word that you say? Tell me Tam. How do I give you a chance under those circumstances? If you can figure out how I can do it Tam let me know." 

I got up and went up to the bedroom and dressed for work. Tammy was showering to get ready for work and I grabbed the recorder from her bedside stand and took it down to the basement and hooked it back up to the phone line. I gambled that Tam was way too shook up to notice that it was gone and that she would call Debbie after I was out of the house and on my way to work. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I had plenty to keep me busy at work and didn't have a lot of time to spend thinking on the Tammy situation. I left work early so I could get home before Tammy and check the recorder. Tammy hadn't made any calls or taken any calls so I played the old recorder and recorded what was on it on the new recorder and then dropped the old one on the floor behind the bedside stand and hooked the new one up to the phone line. 

I got in my truck and drove to Bud's Bar and when my beer arrived I called home and left a message on the answering machine saying that I wouldn't be home until late. There were a couple of guys at the bar that I knew so we got together and shot pool and drank beer until eleven which is when I decided to call it a night and go home. 

Tammy was in the guest bedroom and I didn't know if she was asleep or awake and I didn't care enough to try and find out. I went downstairs and checked the phone tap. There was a call to her sister and a call from her mother but it was the third call I was interested in. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi. It's me." 

"What's up"? 

"I've been busted." 

"Busted? What does that mean?" 

"Apparently your visit to Frank made him very suspicious and he put a recorder on the phone line. He has everything that we talked about. He knows the plan we had for me to sample your hubby's cock. He was less than pleased. He moved me out of our bedroom and is talking divorce." 

"So we are being recorded right now?" 

"No. He gave me the recorder and made me listen to it. It is sitting on the bedside table in the guest bedroom which is where he made me sleep last night." 

"So what are you going to do?" 

"I don't know that I can do anything. He was pretty adamant about the fact that he doesn't trust me any more. He won't believe anything that I tell him. He gave me a week to find a place to stay. Said that if I wasn't out by the next trash pick up day he would set me out on the curb with the trash cans." 

"You can stay with us. Dennis would love that," 

"That's the absolute last thing I'll do. In fact, after talking to you I decided that you were one hundred percent on the money and that I shouldn't risk what I had because of a curiosity. I was going to call you this morning and cancel, but by then it was too late because Frank had already listened to the recorder. I might have been okay if he had waited until today to listen because then he would have heard me call and cancel." 

"I can't see him following through on his threat to move you out. Anybody can see that the man loves you and I know that you love him. He just needs time to cool down." 

"You didn't hear him Deb. His tone of voice was the coldest I've ever heard. I really believe that he meant every word that he said. It doesn't help any that I can see where he is coming from. He does take business trips that keep him gone for days at a time and after what he heard on the recorder why should he trust that I'll behave while he is gone. What is even worse is that he heard how much of a slut I was when he was away in Texas so now he is thinking that I've probably been cheating on him our entire marriage." 

"I'm surprised that you haven't. I would have bet good money that you would have kept on being a cock crazy slut even after saying "I do" to Frank." 

"It is called love Deb. I love him so much that I never even thought about any other guys until you brought up your hubby's cock size and my curiosity overrode my better sense. I can't believe that I let it happen." 

"It's probably that seven year itch thing. You are coming up on your seventh anniversary." 

"Doesn't look like I'm going to make it and that sucks. I've already bought the card and gift." 

"I wish I could tell you what to do, but I don't have a clue. To be honest about it I can't even identify with you on this. I've only felt that strongly about one man in my life and other than a couple of dates he would never have anything to do with me. He could have saved me from being what I am. I know in my heart that if I could have gotten him no other man would have ever touched me." 

"You didn't stop when you married Dennis." 

"That's because Dennis and I aren't in love. A strong like maybe, but nowhere near being in love." 

"Then why did you get married?" 

"It is a marriage of convenience Tam. Dennis needed a wife for appearances sake. He needed to be seen as a family man at work, but he needed a wife who understood that he could never be a one woman man. On my part I was tired of being single and living in a one room apartment, but I needed a man who could accept that I was going to want to play on the side so Dennis and I were a perfect fit. And so far it is working, but I can tell you that there is a man who could make me walk away from Dennis and be a one man woman and I'd do it in a heartbeat. But it will never happen except in my dreams." 

"That doesn't make sense. On the one hand you say you can't be a one man woman. On the other you say you would be a one man woman if you had this mystery guy. It doesn't compute." 

"Of course it does girlfriend. You said it yourself. It is called love. How the hell did we get on this subject anyway? We were talking about your problem. As I see it the only thing you can do is somehow convince Frank that you were not going to go through with your plan and that you love him so much that you will never do anything that will cost you him and your marriage." 

"But how can I do that?" 

"You will need to find someone a lot smarter than me to answer that question." 

So she was going to call and cancel. Interesting. But did it change anything? She could change her mind at any time. The curiosity would still be there. She could swear on a stack of Bibles that she would never cheat on me, but could I believe her? Knowing what I now knew could I ever believe her? Her curiosity had her ready to cheat on me and it was only her boneheaded plan to set me up that screwed things up for her so could I ever be sure that her curiosity wouldn't cause her to cheat if she ever thought she was absolutely sure that she could get away with it?  

===

It didn't help the decision process any that I loved her and had from the moment that I met her. Did I dare give her the benefit of the doubt? I was relieved to hear that she had not cheated on me since we took our vows and she seemed sincere when saying that she loved me and didn't want to lose me or our marriage, but did I dare take the chance? 

The problem was that I had no way of knowing. She could do anything while I was gone and I wouldn't know unless I was willing to bankrupt myself paying private detectives to watch her while I was away. 

Then another thought hit me. 

What if Tammy noticed the recorder was gone and hadn't looked to see if it was on the floor? What if she saw it gone and figured that I had hooked it back up to the phone line? What if the call I was listening to was bullshit that I was meant to hear? 

That is the thought that made up my mind for me. It was indicative of the thoughts that I was always going to have if I stayed with Tammy. Doubt would always be there and everything she said or did would have my mind looking at it several different ways trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't and what was a lie and what wasn't. The bottom line is that the trust was gone. The love might still be there, but the trust was gone. I would be questioning everything she said and did and I could not – would not! – live like that. 

I would make an appointment to see an attorney as soon as I got to work in the morning. Report_Story
