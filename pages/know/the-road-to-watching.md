The Road to Watching

WARNING: If you have strong religious beliefs you might want to avoid reading this story. It is guaranteed to piss off almost every known religion. 

* 

What started me on the journey toward wanting to watch my wife with another man was an advertisement in a magazine. It was in "Argosy" a man's magazine that is no longer around. God, I don't even want to dwell on how long ago that was, but the memory of that ad still stands clear in my mind. 

"Become an ordained minister. Start your own church and reap the spiritual benefits of bringing The Word to your congregation. You will also be eligible for the tax benefits that all religious organizations are entitled to. 

For a limited time only the Chicago Archdiocese of The Church of The New Truth is accepting applications for the issuance of charters to establish our presence in areas were we currently have no ministries. 

Send $10.00 to: 

The Church of The New Truth 

Office of Spiritual Enlightenment 

Post Office Box 222 

Chicago, Illinois 

Act now while your area is still available." 

Now it needs to be understood that I am a stone agnostic, but I got to thinking about what a kick it would be to be an ordained minister and have my own church. I knew it was a scam, but I thought that I could get a hundred dollars worth of fun out of my $10.00 application fee. And I did! 

Six weeks after I mailed in my fee I received a packet in the mail. It contained a Certificate of Ordination; a wallet sized identification card that said I was a minister and a booklet telling me how to go about setting up my church; where to file the necessary papers with the local governments and most importantly - the things I could do to use my church to avoid paying taxes. 

I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but as I read that booklet I saw that it was an open invitation to become a tax fraud case when the IRS got my return. It told me how to use my house as a church which would allow me to escape having to pay property taxes and how I could claim my personal vehicle and vehicle expenses as a deduction. The biggie was that I should give all my paycheck from my regular job to the church as tithing, claim it on Schedule A as cash contribution to the church and then turn around and have the church give it back to me as my wages for being the pastor of the church as those wages were taxed at a much lower rate. I could just see the IRS agent rubbing his hands with glee as he read that return. No, I would use my ordination for entertainment purposes only. 

I started out by telling the guys I worked with that I had "found God" and was going to start my own church. I showed them my certificate of ordination and then asked them if they would like to join my church. They laughed, as I knew they would, and then one of them asked why, with so many established religions already out there, should they join my church. 

"Because the established churches spread a false gospel" I said, "They all, every last one of them are steering you down the wrong path." 

"How do you figure that?" 

"They all preach against sin." 

"Yeah, so?" 

"It is all just so wrong! Let me ask you a couple of questions. Do you consider yourself a Christian?" 

"Yes." 

"Do you believe in Jesus?" 

"I do." 

"Do you accept that Christ died for your sins?" 

"I suppose so." 

"Then answer me this. If Christ died for your sins and you don't sin are you not saying that Christ died in vain?" 

"What the hell are you saying?" 

"The other churches are preaching against sin; my church preaches for it! The doctrine of my church is that we must -- MUST -- sin in order to validate the death of Christ!" 

I got a loud "Amen brother: from Sam Taylor and Bennie Kotlarz took off his cap, put a quarter in it and passed it around as a collection plate and my ministry was off and running. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

Four the next several months the guys would come to me every Monday morning for confession. Sam Taylor started it. The first Monday following my "sermon" Sam came up to me and asked me where the confessional was. He caught me off guard with that and I said, "What?" 

"A booth where I can confess my sins." 

Suddenly I caught on and said, "No confessional booths in the Church of the New Truth Sam. Sins are not to be hidden away like someone's dirty laundry. Sins belong out in the light of day for every one to see. Sins are to be celebrated as an affirmation that our Lord did not waste his life. Tell us Sam; tell us about your sin." 

"I was at Rooney's Pub Saturday night and Mary Ellen McFee was there. I bought her some drinks and danced with her and talked her into going out into the parking lot with me. She gave me a hell of a blow job and then took me home with her and fucked me on her living room couch while her husband was asleep in the next room." 

"Where's the sin in that?" asked Eddie Catron. 

"I drank the last six bottles of beer he had in the fridge." 

"Oh you slimy bastard!" 

From then on it was like the old radio show "Can You Top This." Every Monday the guys would come to work and confess to some sin or other and then it was a case of the first liar not having a chance. Bennie would always end the session by passing his hat as a collection plate and I actually ended up getting a return on my $10.00 investment. In four months the Church of the New Truth collected $11.36 in Bennie's hat. 

Like most jokes the Church of the New Truth became stale and my certificate of ordination got pushed to the back of one of my drawers and was forgotten. 

++++++++++++++++ 

Several years and two failed marriages later I was working for a job shop in a small town just outside of Detroit. My co-workers were a bunch of hard drinking party animals and most nights after work we would hit a bar just down the street from the shop. Things never got outrageous at the bar during the week because we all had to be at work the next day, but Friday nights were a different story. 

There were a couple of manufacturing plants in the area and a lot of the office girls would stop at the bar after work. The place had a live band on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and a decent sized dance floor so the office girls were never left alone by the guys (but then really, wasn't that what they came in for?). It was basically the same group in there every Friday and after a while everybody knew everybody else. There were enough 'transients' to keep the group lively and interesting, but there was always the "core" group and it hardly ever changed. 

One Friday night I was sitting at a table with three of the guys I worked with and four girls from the wheel plant and the subject of religion came up. I had had several beers and was in a good mood and I dumped the Church of the New Truth and its philosophy on the table and got a bunch of laughs. And then Stella, one of the girls, asked me, "Are you really an ordained minister?" Even after all those years I still had the wallet sized card that said I was an ordained minister in the Church of the New Truth in my billfold and I took it out and handed it to Stella. She looked at it and said: 

"Does this mean that you can perform marriages?" 

"Of course" I said, even though I knew that in order to do so I needed to be registered with the State which I wasn't. The card was passed around the table and when it got back to me I put it away and forgot it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The following Friday was Vern's birthday and so we celebrated it at the bar and by midnight no one was feeling any pain. Vern came up to me with Gloria, a girl who worked across the street in the real estate office and said: 

"Rev, we want to get married." 

Vern and Gloria were both 'blotto' and I was just far enough along myself to go along with the program. I said, "You need a ring." Vern called Candy, the barmaid, over and asked her to get him the pull ring from a beer can. Then I told him we needed two witnesses so he asked Candy to stick around for a minute and he called Bill Miglio over. By then we had drawn a crowd so I turned it into a big production. I went through the wedding ceremony, or as much of it as I could remember in my drunken state, and when I got to the part about if there was anyone who knew why the two shouldn't be married Ray Hendrickson yelled out: 

"She promised me a blow job so she can't be married until I get it." 

I said, "Vern, would you mind if she cheats on you from time to time?" and he said "Fuck no." 

"There you have it Ray. She'll get to you sooner or later." 

Vern slipped the pull tab on Gloria's finger and I pronounced them man and wife and to the cheers of everyone there the two of them left the bar and headed down the street to the motel to begin their honeymoon. 

Wednesday night at the bar Vern and Gloria came up to me and Gloria said, "Rev, we need to get divorced. I kind of forgot that I'm already married." 

"No problem. The Church of the New Truth does not believe that the State has any right to meddle in the personal lives of private citizens so the Church has its own ceremony for ending the relationships we help establish. How about it Vern, you want this divorce?" 

"Hell no. She's just too good in bed." 

"That shouldn't be a problem. You said she could cheat on you with Ray so she can just cheat on her husband with you." 

"Works for me." 

"How about you Gloria?" 

"I can do that." 

"Okay, face each other and hold both hands. Gloria, I want you to say, "I don't want to be married to you anymore so I divorce you" and then let go of Vern's right hand. Vern, when she has dropped your right hand you say the same thing and drop her right hand." 

They both did it and then I said, "In the name of the Church of the New Truth I pronounce you divorced." 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Vern and Gloria were just the start. The Friday following their divorce two other couples wanted to get married and every Friday after that there were two or three and all followed by the divorce ritual sometime during the following week. I typed up a marriage certificate to use in my weddings, but it had a feature that the wedding licenses issued by the State never had -- an expiration date!! The last line on the certificate said: 

"This marriage valid for thirty days from the date affixed. At the end of thirty days the marriage is dissolved unless renewed by both parties or both parties choose to end it sooner." 

I changed the divorce ritual to include tearing up the wedding certificate, dropping it on the floor and having both parties trample it. The fee was the same for the wedding and the divorce -- they had to buy me a beer. 

The surprising thing about it all was that seven of the fake weddings that I performed over the two years I was doing them turned into legitimate marriages. The other thing that came out of it was a nick-name that stayed with me for the next ten years. That first night when Vern said, "Rev, we want to get married" he hung the tag "Rev" on me and it stayed with me long after I left the job shop. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

Anyway, all of this has just been the lead in to the event that made me want to be a wife watcher. It was a Friday night and the bar was getting ready to close. There were eight or nine of us sitting at three tables we had pushed together and none of us were ready to quit partying. Dan, the owner of the real estate office across the street said: 

"Let take the party to my house." 

There was a loud chorus of "Yeah, lets go" and we all left the bar and followed Dan home and went inside. I was right behind Dan when we walked in the front door and I hadn't taken two steps into the house when I heard a woman cry out: 

"Oh God yes! Like that lover, like that. Fuck me hard baby, fuck me hard." 

I looked over at Dan and he said, "Oh; that's just my wife taking care of one of her lovers." 

I looked at him in disbelief and said, "Say what?" 

"That's just my wife and a lover. She always has been a noisy fuck." 

The failed marriages that I mentioned earlier? They had both failed because both of my exes had taken on a lover or two and when I found out I had wanted to kill them all so to hear Dan calmly say that the noise was just his wife fucking one of her lovers blew me away. He saw the look on my face and he shrugged. 

"What can I say? She needs more sex than I can give her so I let her play around. She isn't supposed to be here. The guy she hooked up with tonight was supposed to take her to a motel. If I'd have known they were here I wouldn't have invited everyone over. We were trying to keep our arrangement a secret." 

His wife had made only that one outburst and it was over by the time the rest of the group came in so they didn't hear anything. Dan led us down into his basement which had been finished as a recreation room. It had a pool table, an air hockey table and a bar along one wall. Everyone else had brought the party mood with them and things had picked up right where they had left off when we left the bar. I was off to the side sipping a beer, but my mind wasn't in the room. It was busy reliving the night I had caught my second wife with one of her lovers. Dan came up to me and asked me what was wrong. 

"You were as ready to keep partying as anybody when we left the bar. Now you look like you're down in the dumps. Why the quick change?" 

I'd had enough to drink to be open and so I told him about the memories that his wife had just triggered. I and four friends were on a three day fishing trip. We had driven up to the lake on a Friday morning, pitched the tents and then had taken our poles and gone to catch dinner. One hell of a storm hit about four in the afternoon and howling winds had blown down the tents and a driving rain had soaked everything. We decided to call it quits and we packed and headed for home. By the time we had reached my place we had decided that there was no reason for the weekend to be a total waste and we decided to play poker. 

There was a car that I didn't recognize in the driveway, but I didn't think anything about it because Judy had told me she would probably have a couple of girlfriends over while I was gone. I knew as soon as I walked in the door that the car didn't belong to a girl friend. Girlfriends don't have cocks and what I heard as soon as I was in the door was: 

"I love your cock baby, it feels so hard and so good." 

I ran to the bedroom and as I came through the door I saw Judy with her legs up on a guys shoulders as he rammed his cock into her miserable cunt. Anger and rage were in control as I rushed toward the bed. The two of them were so wrapped up in what they were doing that they never saw me coming. I grabbed the bastard, pulled him off of Judy and threw him into the wall. His head hit hard and he was dazed as he slid down the wall. I hit him several more times, kicked him in the crotch a couple of times and then I turned back to the bed. Judy had pulled the sheet up over herself and was crying: 

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry." 

Rage was still in charge as I went over to the bed and grabbed a handful of her hair and started to drag her off the bed. I don't know what I would have done to her had the other guys not pulled me away from her. Ernie told her she had better get some clothes on and get out of the house while the getting was good. I found out later that the guy was only one in a string of guys she played with when I wasn't around. 

"Walking in your front door and hearing what I heard brought it all back." 

"And because I didn't want to run into the bedroom and kill them you think that I'm some kind of weirdo. Is that it?" 

I didn't say anything, but then I didn't have to because he knew. 

"Our circumstances aren't the same. You caught yours cheating behind your back. I gave mine permission before she even took on her first lover." 

"You gave her permission?" 

"She was a virgin when we got married, but she took to sex like a new born baby duck takes to water. She went from virgin to nymphomaniac in the space of one night. We were having sex seven days a week, two and three times a night and she was turning me into a physical wreck. I could not keep up with her and she still wanted more. I finally had to tell her no. I told her once a night, three or four times a week and maybe twice on a Saturday or Sunday. A year went by and one night she told me that she was leaving me. She said she loved me too much to stab me in the back by cheating on me, but she needed more sex than I could give her. She was going to divorce me and try and find someone with the same sex drive she had. I loved her and I didn't want to lose her so I gave her permission to play around." 

"That's it? Just let her play around and you both live happily ever after?" 

"No, it was a lot harder than that. The first year damned near killed me. I'd told her to go ahead, but I wasn't near ready for the mental anguish that occurred when she started taking lovers. I won't go into it, but believe me when I say that it wasn't pretty, but I eventually came to terms with it. Then something happened that changed everything." 

"What?" 

"I saw her with one of her lovers. I found out that I get fired up watching her have sex. We went back to making love twice a night, four or five nights a week." 

"You watch her?" 

"Yes I do, and believe me when I say it is one hell of a turn on." 

All I could do was stand there with disbelief written all over my face. 

"You ever see two people having sex?" 

"Just in porno movies." 

"Hell man, that isn't real, that's just actors faking it. You need to see real people going at it for real. Come on, I'll show you what I mean." 

I followed him upstairs and then down a hallway. I could hear moans and groans and a woman asking for it harder. Dan led me past the door to the room the noises were coming from it and into the room next to it. We went inside and he took a picture off the wall. 

"It covers a see-thru mirror" he said as he took it down. I looked into the room and got another surprise. 

"Gloria is your wife?" 

"No one knows. They know that she is married, but they don't know it is to me. They think she just works in my office. I believe you know the guy with her. Or at least you have seen him before. You married the two of them earlier tonight." 

I was looking through the glass at the two on the bed when Dan said, "Can you see the difference between porn movies and the real thing? No fake dialog that sounds phony when you hear it. No stupid sounding background music. Nothing fake in there! You don't see enthusiasm like that in porno movies either." 

I stood next to him and watched as his wife did her best to destroy Harry and wondered why I had never taken a shot at Gloria. She had a lovely face and a super body and she had always let me know that she was available. 

"One of the turn ons" Dan said, "Is seeing and learning things about her that you can't see when you are up close and making love. See how the toes of her right foot curl, but the toes on her left are straight? You would never see something like that while you were making love. Look how erotic her small hands look as she digs her nails into his ass. I know what the nails feel like, but I never had a clue that was she was doing could be such a turn on itself when you see it." 

In the next room Gloria cried out, "No! Oh God please no, I'm almost there. Please, please don't stop" but apparently Harry was too close to hold it. "Damn it, no!" she cried and pushed him off of her. She quickly moved and sucked Harry's softening cock into her mouth while one of her hands went to her pussy and she worked on her clit while working on Harry's cock. 

"I need to get back to my other guests. You want to stay here?" 

I wanted to, but I would have been too embarrassed to let him know that yes, I did want to stay and watch his wife, Hell, what I wanted was to run into the room, pull her away from Harry and have her myself. I shook my head no in answer to his question and he hung the picture back up and we went back down to the basement rec room to join the others. Shortly after that I went home.

+++++++++++++++++ 

It was three days before I stopped at the bar again and I was sitting on a stool at the bar sipping on a Pabst Blue Ribbon when Gloria walked in, saw me and came over and sat down on the stool next to me. 

"Hey sailor, buy a girl a drink?" 

I waved Candy over and she built Gloria a Tom Collins and set down on the bar in front of Gloria. Gloria took a sip of her drink and then said: 

"Dan told me that you watched part of the show the other night." 

I nodded a yes and Gloria said, "Too bad I didn't know you were there. I would have come out and got you. The twit you married me to wasn't up to the task. Did you like what you saw?" 

I was about to shrug my shoulders in a noncommittal way when she laughed and exclaimed, "You did! It is written all over your face. Did you wish it was you in there with me?" 

Before I could answer she laughed again. "I hope you don't play much poker Rev; your face can't hide anything." 

She knocked back her drink, got off her stool and said, "No time like the present" and she tugged on my arm and like an obedient puppy I followed her home. 

In her bedroom I stood and watched as she stripped and when she was naked she looked at me standing there fully dressed and looking nervously from her to the mirror on the wall and then back to her. She knew what was going on in my mind and said: 

"What's the matter baby, never been watched?" 

I mumbled a no and she said, "Don't sweat it sweetie, Dan isn't there. He has meetings until nine tonight. But then again; if you are as good as I hope you will be we will still be at it by then." 

I don't know if I was a good she hoped I would be, but it was ten to ten before she couldn't get me up again. I never did find out if Dan was home by nine and had maybe watched us. As I was dressing Gloria said, "I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. Maybe we can do it again sometime. 

"I'm free every night this week." 

"That's sweet baby, that you want me again, but my deal with Dan is that I can't do the same guy more than once in any thirty day period. I promise you though, I will plan on seeing you again in thirty days." 

Twice more in the coming month Dan had everyone over to his house when the bar closed and both times I snuck away from the party in the basement and went upstairs to take down the picture so I could watch Gloria, but she wasn't there either time. Before I could connect with Gloria again I was laid off and when I found another job it was on the other side of Detroit. I found an apartment close to the job and moved. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Almost a year went by and then one night I stopped at a bar close to where I lived and as I sat down at the bar a Pabst Blue Ribbon was placed on the bar in front of me. I looked up and saw that the barmaid was Candy. 

"How you doing Rev? Long time, no see. I haven't seen you in here before." 

"Never been in here before. How long have you been here?" 

"About six months now." 

"What happened to your job at the Strip?" 

"Place wasn't fun any more after you left." 

"Oh come on Candy, I know you didn't leave because I stopped coming in." 

"That's where you are wrong Rev. I couldn't stand the place any more after you left. Every time I went in to work the place would remind me of you and I finally reached the point where I couldn't take it any more." 

I sat there looking at her trying to make sense out of what she was saying and she saw the look on my face and said: 

"That's right Rev, I spent all my time behind the bar hoping that you would notice me and ask me out. I even had a ring that I bought at the dime store for when you did the wedding ceremony for us." 

"I thought you had a boyfriend. That guy Sam who was always hanging around." 

"Just a guy I liked enough to date a lot, but he was never anything special." 

"Seeing anyone now?" 

"Nope. You?" 

"No, no one for a while now." 

"I get off at eleven." 

And that started my relationship with Candy. I started stopping in at the bar every night on my way home from work and she always called me Rev and the other bar regulars picked up on it and started using it. No one ever asked me about it and so no 'Rev' games got played. Candy and I dated for almost a year before deciding to move in and live together and then we lived together for about three years. 

I was offered a job in Colorado and I accepted. I told Candy I'd try it for three months and if it worked out I'd be back to get her and move her and her two kids to Denver. I got the three months in and the job looked stable so I called Candy and told her to give her notice and start packing and that I'd be back to get her around Christmas time. 

I got back on the 23rd, proposed on the 24th and we got the blood tests done, got the license and were married just after the first of the year. I rented a U-Haul, loaded everything into it, handed Candy the airline tickets for her and the kids and then I got in the truck and hauled ass for Denver. I got to Denver and started unloading the U-Haul into a house I had rented with option to buy. The next day I was at the airport when Candy and the kids got off of the United 727 and I drove them to the house and when we got there I gave Candy the bad news. I was working the afternoon shift and it was the day I had to report back to work so she was going to have to do the unpacking alone. 

When I got home at one in the morning I was whipped. The drive from Michigan in the U-Haul, unloading it into the house and then having to go right into work had my ass dragging. Candy led me into the bedroom that she had decided would be ours and I hit the bed and was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. 

++++++++++++++++ 

When I woke up the next morning and sat up I was immediately disoriented. I thought I was back in Michigan. Specifically, I thought I was back in Gloria's bedroom. The bed, the dresser and the night stand were sitting in the same positions as the furniture in Gloria's bedroom and on the wall in exact same place that Gloria's see-thru mirror had been Candy had hung a mirror. It took me a couple of seconds to come fully awake and remember where I was. 

That night I made love to my new wife for the very first time in our new home and damned if I didn't keep glancing over at that mirror. It made no sense. I knew the mirror wasn't see-thru and I knew that there wasn't a hole in the wall behind it. I knew there was no one watching, but I kept glancing over at that mirror anyway. Luckily Candy had her eyes closed and her head was rolling from side to side so she didn't catch me at it. If she had she would have wanted to know why and I would have been hard put to explain it. 

What did happen that night was that as I was glancing over at the mirror I remembered watching Gloria with Dan and I remembered him pointing out things to me as we watched through the mirror. Over the next weeks and months I found myself wondering if Candy's toes curled when we made love. She had long legs and she was able to hook her ankles together behind my back and I wondered what that looked like. When she rode me reverse cowgirl was her facial expression different from when she rode me straight cowgirl. What was her facial expression when I did her doggie? When I had her doggie did her tits sway forward and back or did they just hang and jiggle? In short, I thought about and wondered about all the things I couldn't see and then I wondered how I could go about seeing them. 

After about a year of wondering I decided that I needed to find out the answers to the questions I had. I set up a video camera to tape us making love. Candy didn't like the idea and it took me a while to talk her into letting me do it. It didn't work out well. Candy was nervous and kept looking over at the camera and because she was nervous she didn't do any of the things that she normally did. She pretty much just laid there and looked at the camera. 

Then I decided to get cute. A couple of weeks later I hid the camera where it could tape us and didn't tell Candy. Things started out well, but then they went to hell in a hurry. Have I mentioned that I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer? I didn't cover the little red light that indicated that the recorder was on and Candy spotted it. She pushed me off her and then she went off on me. The gist of her rant was: 

"What the hell is with you and that stupid video camera?" 

I was busted so I thought; "What the Hell?" and I told Candy why I wanted to tape us. She heard me out and then said: 

"At least you didn't ask me to do another guy so you could watch." 

Remember Gloria telling me that with my face I shouldn't play poker because my face couldn't hide anything? Well, when Candy mentioned her and another guy I did have a fleeting thought about it and Candy was looking at my face when I had that thought and she read it on my face. 

"Oh no! No god-damned way in hell. If you value your balls don't you even dare ask." 

But the seed was planted. 

++++++++++++++++ 

Over the next year or so I began to think of ways to make it happen. I never said a word to Candy about it because I DID value my balls. I began buying magazines that had wife watching stories in them and visiting erotic story sites on the Internet hoping to read something that might give me an idea on how to make Candy want to do it. If it was her idea she couldn't hold it against me, right? 

I was smart enough not to leave the magazines out where Candy could see them. I'd read them when she wasn't around and the stash them in the bottom drawer of my roll-a-way tool box in the garage. Every once in a while I would find a story that would give me an idea that I might be able to make work and I would dog-ear the page so I could come back to it and re-read it. I was never able to put any of the ideas into play because the right situations never came up. 

Another year went by and then one Saturday Candy and I were sitting at a table in the food court at the mall when Candy said: 

"How about him?" 

I looked up from the flyer I was reading and asked, "What?" 

"That guy over there by the escalator. He has a nice looking butt and he looks fit. Think you could watch him fuck me?" 

I was stunned by what she's just said and before I could recover and say anything she said: 

"Too late; he's gone. I want to hit the shoe store before we leave so let's get going. We still have to pick the kids up in an hour." 

She tried on several pairs of shoes before she decided to buy the first pair she had tried on. As we were walking out to the car she said: 

"Too bad I wasn't wearing a skirt. I could have flashed my pussy at him while he was on his knees helping me try on the shoes. Maybe he would have followed us home. He was cute, but maybe he was a little on the young side. I might feel like I was robbing the cradle. What do you think? Would watching me fuck a guy half my age be a turn on for you?" 

Before I could say anything she exclaimed, "Oh shit! We forgot to get the sweat suit that Ginny needs for her PE class" and then she was off on a rant about the schools and how they didn't do 'this' or do 'that' and I just sat there and listened. I decided that I wasn't going to say anything and just let Candy be. I'd never mentioned watching her and all she had to go on was that fleeting facial expression way back when. Obviously she had my watching her on her mind or she wouldn't have said the things she did. I decided to just keep my mouth shut and let her talk herself into it. 

That night in bed Candy went after my cock like a starving woman. I was undressing for bed when she came over to me, pulled my briefs down and went to her knees in front of me. She took my cock in her mouth and when she had it rock hard she stood up, led me over to the bed and pushed me down on it. 

"Close your eyes" she said as she moved over me, took my cock and guided it into her pussy. "Keep your eyes closed baby. In your mind who do you see fucking me baby? Which one of your good buddies do you imagine me sliding up and down on? Kip looks like he has a big cock. Would you like that baby? Would you like to see a big cock sliding into me? I might like a big cock baby; I've never had a really big one. Keep your eyes closed baby. George would fuck me. So would Tom, Ralph and Tony. They have all hit on me at one time or another. Does that turn you on baby? Does knowing that your good friends want to fuck your wife turn you on?" 

As she was talking she was pounding down on me and I was getting close. I was arching up into her when she said: 

"Maybe the next time they are over to play cards I'll send you to the store for something and while you are gone I'll have them line up and drop their trousers so I can check out their cocks. And then maybe I'll fuck the one with the biggest cock. Would you like that baby? Would you like coming home and finding me with a big cock in me?" 

I blew my load into her hot pussy and she giggled and said, "I guess you would." 

She pulled off of me and moved into a sixty-nine. "You didn't get me off baby, so I guess we will have to do it again" and she wrapped her lips around my dick. 

We made love twice more that night and Candy kept up a running dialog on what she might do and would it turn me on through both of those times, but I kept my mouth shut. I would let her talk herself into doing it and it was looking like she was on her way to doing just that. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Sunday was a quiet day and Candy went to bed early with a headache so there was no sex that night. Monday was parent/teacher night at the kid's school and Candy and I went right from work to school and we were both whipped when we got home so we didn't make love that night either, but Tuesday as I climbed into bed Candy spread her legs wide and asked: 

"Do I have a good looking pussy?" 

"It looks good enough to eat." 

"Good; do it." 

As I settled in to feast on her cum muffin she said: 

"One of the guys from work hit on me today. Kind of handsome in a rugged sort of way. Oooh, that's it baby, oh yeah, work my clit. You going to do this when I fuck somebody baby? You going to eat me when he is done with me?" 

Candy's thighs clamped my head, but my ears still heard that "when." But they also heard the part about eating her when the guy was finished. That wasn't and had never been on the program and no, I had no intension of doing it. Luckily she had her hands in my hair and was pulling me into her box so I wasn't able to say "No way!" I say luckily because if I had said "No way" to her it might have caused her to change her mind. I had her heading in the right direction and I wasn't about to put up any detour signs. 

I gave Candy an orgasm with my mouth and she pushed my head away and told me to move up and fuck her. 

"Not make love baby, but fuck! Do me hard like Marv will if I let him. He wants me baby; I could see the tent in his trousers when he came over to my desk. It was a pretty nice bulge baby. Come on, fuck me hard. Pretend you are Marv hanging horns on my husband. Oh yeah Marv, fuck me, fuck me hard with your big cock." 

It went on like that both times we made love and I felt I was getting closer and closer to what I wanted. 

++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning just before I left for work Candy came into the kitchen and asked, "How do I look?" She was wearing a short skirt, high heels and a blouse that even though it wasn't low-cut still showed a bit of cleavage. 

"You look sexy as hell. You going to work like that?" 

"You want to catch something you need to put out attractive bait." 

"Bait?" 

"Yeah baby, bait. This is Wednesday remember? The day I stop after work for drinks with the crew? Your night to feed the kids? I may be late because Marv might stop with us. Think he'll like?" she asked as she did a pirouette. 

"Any man would be crazy if he didn't." 

She came over to me, kissed my cheek and said; "Wish me luck" as she headed out the door to her car. I watched her back out of the drive and I was saying to myself, "What the fuck!" I wasn't interested in her going out and getting laid. It was all about being able to watch and she hadn't said one word about bringing this Marv guy home with her. 

Half a dozen times during the day I caught myself reaching for the phone to call Candy and ask her what she planned on doing and each time I stopped myself thinking, "You are so close. Don't do anything to derail things." 

The evening was hell for me. I fed the kids, helped them with their homework and then we watched a Harry Potter DVD. They were in bed by nine-thirty and I took a book and headed for my bedroom. I propped myself up with a couple of pillows and tried to read, but I was having a hard time trying to concentrate. I kept looking over at the clock and the hands didn't seem to move at all. I'd read a page and glance at the clock, read a page and glance at the clock and finally I couldn't stand it and I dropped the book on the floor next to the bed and went to the family room and plopped down in front of the TV. I jumped channels trying to find something that would take my mind off of Candy and what she might be doing. In my mind I saw her in a motel room with that Marv fuck and I clenched my teeth so hard my jaw started to hurt. I was supposed to see it damn it, not sit on my couch and imagine it. 

At eleven-thirty I went to bed. I tossed and turned for another hour or so and was almost asleep when I heard the garage door opener start to run. I glanced at the clock and saw that it was almost one. I was pissed! So pissed that I knew better than to say anything to Candy until I'd had time to cool down so I rolled over on my side and pretended to be asleep. 

When she came into the room she called out, "Baby? Are you awake baby?" 

I didn't answer and I heard her undressing. She climbed into bed and put a hand on my shoulder and gently shook me. 

"Baby? Wake up baby, I need you. I'm horny as hell baby, wake up and help me out." 

She shook me again and I just lay there and pretended to be asleep. She took her hand off my shoulder and I heard her sigh as she settled in to go to sleep and several minutes later I heard the steady breathing that told me she had fallen asleep. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning I was up and out of the house before Candy woke up. I did not want to start the day out with a bad scene and then have to carry it around with me all day. I'd be carrying enough just thinking about Candy and that asshole Marv. 

I spent most of the day thinking about what to do. Candy had cheated on me and what was I going to do about it. There wasn't any doubt in my mind. She as good as told me she was going to fuck Marv before she even left the house. All that talk about needing bait and asking me if she thought Marv would like the way she looked. Then telling me to wish her luck and not wait up. Add to that having me pretend to be Marv the last time we fucked then throw in coming home four hours later than normal and of course it all added up to her cheating on me with the asshole. 

She would try to tell me that it wasn't cheating because I was the one who wanted her to fuck other men, but that would be a load of bullshit! I did not want her out fucking other men and she knew it. I did want to watch her with another man once or maybe even twice, so I could satisfy my curiosity about some things, but there wasn't anything said about me watching her with Marv. No, she had cheated and what was I going to do about it. 

I spent the entire day getting absolutely nothing done that I was being paid to do. All my thoughts were on my "Candy problem" and what to do about it and in the end I did nothing. Nothing at all! I loved Candy and I had no actual proof that she had done anything. I could suspect all I wanted, but in the absence of some sort of proof I was not going to fuck up my relationship with Candy by making accusations I couldn't back up.  

===

Dinner was a quiet affair as far as conversation between me and Candy went. We listened to the kids tell us about their day at school and then we spent family time until they went to bed. I slept in the nude and I was undressed, ready for bed and standing at the sink brushing my teeth when Candy came into the room. She came up behind me, reached around in front of me and took hold of my cock. It did what it always did when Candy touched it and she said: 

"I wanted this last night baby. I wanted it bad. I came home horny as hell and I needed it bad." 

"You told me not to wait up so I didn't." 

"I know that is what I said, but I still expected you to be up." 

"Why would you expect that?" 

"Oh come on baby, get real. I go out to try and hook up with another man and you didn't want to know about it?" 

"No Candy, I didn't. I didn't hear one word from you about my being able to watch so I went to bed." 

"You really didn't think I would put out for some guy without you being there, did you?" 

"It certainly sounded that way from what you said before you left." 

"Baby baby baby, you have to know me better than that. First of all I needed to find out if Marv was really interested and then I needed to find out if he could handle being watched while he did me." 

I rinsed my mouth out, spat it out into the sink and then turned and headed for the bed. Candy let go of my cock long enough to get undressed. She got on the bed with me and lowered her head to take me in her mouth and when she got me wet enough to suit her she moved over me and impaled herself. She moaned as she slid down on me and said: 

"God baby, that feels good. I bet Marv's would have felt good last night if I had let him do me. He has a big one baby; I measured it." 

I guess she saw my eyes widen when she said that because she said: 

"I did baby, I measured it. Nine and a quarter inches baby, long and as big around as my wrist. I could barely get my hand around it. He hit on me at work again the day before yesterday and I laughed at him and told him that I was sorry, but I only do guys with big cocks. He laughed and told me that if that was true he was my guy. He said he had an exceptionally large cock and I said, "Yeah, sure, that's what all you guys say. He told me he would bring in a measuring tape and I could measure him in the supply closet. I told him no, that we could do it when we stopped for drinks after work. 

"He didn't lie baby; it was fucking huge. I wanted to take him on right there on the seat of his car but I didn't because you weren't there to watch. I did give him a hand job though. He asked for head, but I didn't think that would be right with you not there. Would you have liked that baby? Would you have liked seeing that huge cock slide into my tight pussy? Would you have liked hearing me scream in pleasure as he plowed my pussy with his huge piece of meat?" 

"Bitch" I muttered as I pushed myself hard up into her and busted my nut. 

She laughed. "I let him suck my tits baby and he even got a finger into my pussy. I was hot baby and I wanted him bad, but I couldn't have him because you weren't there. God he was big and I wanted it so bad." 

"When are you going to bring him home with you?" 

"I'm meeting him for drinks after work tomorrow and if things go right I should have him here just after you get the kids to bed." 

The next day was a bad one for me. All I could think about was Candy on our bed with this Marv guy and them doing it. I was finally going to see the things I wanted to see and the anticipation was driving me nuts. It was all I could do not to send the kids to bed early and call Candy on her cell and tell her to hurry home. The kids were down at nine-thirty and I was sitting on the couch waiting when I heard the garage door opener. I wrung my hands as I wondered what the protocol was. Do I stand up and shake the guys hand and thank him for coming or just remain in the background as things happen. The door opened and Candy came in and closed the door behind her. She was alone. 

"Where is he?" 

"He isn't going to be coming baby. I'm never going to get to try out that big cock." 

"Why not?" 

"Because he is an asshole. When I told him that the only way he could have me was with you watching he said, "No problem. I'll be glad to come over and show him how it should be done. Maybe I'll even give him a lesson or two on how to take care of a hot piece like you." It pissed me off when he said that. I told him that you take care of me just fine and then I told him he was a jerk and I walked away from him. Take me to bed baby. I need your cock in me." 

+++++++++++++++++ 

A week went by and on Tuesday night Candy said, "They hired a really cute guy for the mailroom and I've talked him into joining us when we stop for drinks on Wednesday after work. You okay with me being with a guy who is ten or twelve years younger than me?" 

She paused and before I could say anything she giggled and said, "Silly me, of course you are okay with it." 

I had just cum for the second time that night and she had just sucked me hard trying to get me up for a third time. As she was swinging over me cowgirl I suspected what was coming and sure enough it did. Apparently her new thing was to ride me so she could look down into my face as she told me what she would be doing. 

"How would you like that baby? Watching me teach some young kid how to please a woman? He's too young to have much experience so I'll have to teach him almost everything. I'll suck his cock, teach him how to eat my pussy and maybe I'll even let him have my ass. Would you like to see that baby? Would you like seeing some young stud slam his hard cock in my ass?" 

She kept up the dialog until I shot off into her and then she fell next to me, snuggled up close and fell asleep. 

The next morning after the kids had left for school and we were dressing for work Candy said, "Don't forget that it is my night out baby. If things go right with young Jason I might be a little late so don't wait up." 

This time was different because I knew she was checking out the guy from the mailroom to see if he was suitable so I did wait up. While I was waiting I was thinking of what she might be doing as I sat and watched the hands of the clock do their slow crawl around the dial. Was she dancing real close with him? Did his hands slide down and cup her ass cheeks and pull her tight against him? Did she kiss him on the dance floor -- maybe slip him some tongue while her co- workers watched? Was Marv there and if he was what was he thinking as he watched some young kid get ready to take what had almost been his. Did she go out into the parking lot with Jason? Did she open his pants and check out his cock? Did Jason get a finger in her wet pussy? The questions were endless and not knowing any of the answers was making me crazy. 

The night drug on and finally, around eleven, I heard the garage door opener start running. I was in bed when Candy came into the room and when she saw that I was awake she smiled and said: 

"I was hoping you would be up. I'm a little keyed up and I could use a hard cock to help relax me." 

I pushed the sheet aside and she saw my erection pointing up at the ceiling. "Oh baby" she said, "Just what this girl needs. She got on the bed with me and swung over me in a sixty-nine and went to work on my cock. I looked up at her pussy as it slowly descended toward my mouth and I wondered if anything had been in it that night. Candy must have been reading my mind. 

"Taste it baby, and see if you can taste him. He got three fingers in there baby; he made me cum with his fingers. See if you can taste him" and she shoved her pussy down on my face. 

She was wet, but I couldn't taste anything different from the way she tasted every other time I'd eaten her and I told her so. She swung over me and used her right hand to guide me up into her and said: 

"You want to lick my fingers? Maybe you can taste him on my hand. I gave him a hand job in the parking lot baby. I cleaned up the mess, but maybe there might be just a little bit of flavor left." 

Again my face told her what I was thinking. 

"Oops. I guess not. My baby isn't into dicks. He has a nice one baby. About the size of yours, but curved like a banana. He is a good kisser and he knows how to handle a woman's breasts. I let him suck on them while I jacked him off. He begged me for a blow job, but I told him no; not until you could be there to watch." 

"When" I asked as I rolled and put Candy under me. I was pounding her hard and she had an orgasm that had her cunt muscles squeezing my cock and it brought me off. I held myself over her and let my cock go limp in her pussy and then I repeated my question. "When?" 

"I don't know baby, but when it happens it won't be Jason. He freaked out on me when I told him you would be watching us." 

I pulled out of her and fell to the bed next to her. She snuggled up close and said, "I'll find someone baby, just be patient." 

++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning as we were leaving for work Candy said. "I may have another candidate. A guy I met after Jason freaked out on me. I agreed to meet him for a drink after work." 

"Where did you meet him?" 

"He was at the bar. I've seen him there almost every time we stop, but last night was the first time he talked to me. I was kind of flustered when I came in from the parking lot after Jason roared off in his car and Jake saw me and asked me if I was all right." 

She was home by eight and after the kids had gone to bed she led me into the bedroom and told me she was horny. She got on the bed and got on her knees and elbows. She wiggled her ass at me and said: 

"Do me doggie baby. Fuck me hard and get me off." 

As I pushed my cock into her she moaned and said: 

"Jake says he loves doggie baby. Pretend you're Jake and fuck me hard. He's the one baby. He likes the idea that you will be watching. He says he would like to watch you do me after he is done. Tomorrow night baby; he is going to fuck me tomorrow night. I'm going to give him your pussy baby; he is going to use what used to be only yours. Fuck me Jake. Fuck me hard and make me cum." 

I did and she did and then I had mine. As we lay in bed Candy told me that she was going to meet Jake at the bar after work and that she would bring him home with her after the kids were in bed. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day I didn't get a damned thing accomplished at work. I spent all day thinking of what was going to happen that night. I fed the kids, played with them for a while, watched a DVD with them and then got them off to bed. At a quarter to ten Candy called me and asked me if the kids were in bed and when I said they were she said: 

"His fingers are in me baby. He wanted to play with my pussy while I'm on the phone with you. Get ready baby, we're on the way" and she disconnected. I hurried into the bedroom and made a last minute check that everything was ready. I had put a dinning room chair next to the bed and I had hidden the video camera (I remembered the light this time) and then I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally a car pulled up in front of the house and I quickly moved to the couch, sat down and pretended to be interested in whatever it was on the TV. I didn't want this Jake guy to think I was too anxious. The door opened and a flustered looking Candy walked in and closed the door behind her. I looked at her and she read my face and said: 

"He's not coming." 

She turned and headed for the bedroom and I got up and followed her. She undressed, brushed her teeth, gargled with mouthwash and then got in bed and pulled the covers up over her and then she told me that we wouldn't be making love that night. 

"What's wrong?" 

"I was stupid and you are going to hate me." 

"Why would I hate you?" 

"Because I cheated on you tonight." 

And then the story came out. She had met Jake at the bar and they had danced and he had kissed her and felt her up and then they had gone out into the parking lot and made out. He had finger fucked her and she had jerked him off and then she made the call to me. On the way he had unzipped and had taken his cock out and she had slid over next to him and stroked him as he drove and then she had bent her head and had taken his cock in her mouth. 

"I sucked him off. I sucked his cock and let him cum in my mouth. I didn't consider it cheating because we were coming here to fuck so you could watch. I thought if I got him off one more time in the car he would last a lot longer in bed and give you a better show. When we pulled up in front of the house he put his cock away and told me to get out of the car. I got out and waited for him to follow me, but he drove off and left me standing there on the sidewalk." 

I wasn't happy with her sucking the guys cock, but under the circumstances I knew what I had to do. I got in bed, pulled her to me, told her I could never hate her and then I held her until she fell asleep. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

I've mentioned that I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I'm not totally stupid either. As I held Candy and stared up at the ceiling there was a little something nagging at me and it was still there trying to tell me something when I fell asleep. The next day things were kind of quiet as Candy avoided me as much as possible. Around noon she asked me to run her over to the bar where she had left her car and then she took the kids and went shopping. 

As soon as she was gone I headed for the garage. I opened the bottom drawer of my toolbox and looked at my magazines. I immediately noticed that the magazines were out of order. The last issues of Penthouse Letters, Variations and Penthouse Forum should have been right on top, but they weren't. I dug down into the drawer until I found what I was looking for. It was a two year old copy of Variations and I leafed through it until I found the story about the married woman trying to seduce the boy who worked in her company's mailroom. Candy had even used the same name - Jason! 

A three year old copy of Penthouse Forum yielded the story about a man named Jake who conned a married woman out of a blow job and then kicked her out of his car. I was digging and looking for a story about a guy named Marv who was an arrogant asshole when the garage door opener started to run. I closed the tool box drawer, grabbed a screwdriver and stepped to my work bench and pretended to be working on something. Candy pulled into the garage and I put the screwdriver away and helped her carry the groceries into the house. 

Candy stayed clear of me the rest of the afternoon and as I watched her avoid me I came to realize that my wife was quite the accomplished actress and I also realized that she knew me better than I seemed to know myself. 

Something, probably something as simple as needing a screwdriver for some household repair, had taken her out to my tool box and she had discovered my magazine stash. She looked through them, read the dog-eared pages and realized what I wanted. She was using what she had read to lead me on - some sort of role play I suppose - but to what purpose? She was acting out a part and she knew that I loved her and would forgive her for what she had done (or pretended to do) with Jake. Once things began to clear in my head I even knew that she knew how and what I would do in the way of forgiving her. 

That night I pushed her down on the bed and shoved my cock in her face. 

"Suck it you little slut! Suck it like you sucked Jake's." She started to say, "But I ..." and I pushed my cock in her opened mouth. "Suck it Candy, suck it good and swallow my cum the same way you swallowed Jake's." 

She grabbed my hips, pulled me to her and deep throated me. As she worked on me I though that if there had been a Jake he would have gotten one of the best blow jobs of his life. 

I felt it building up and I said, "Here it comes you little slut. Take it all." 

She gulped and swallowed and then she pulled her mouth off of me a sputtered: 

"I am not a slut damn you." 

"Sure you are. What else would you call a married woman who sucks off a man she picked up at a bar on the front seat of his car while he is driving? You do it in front of me you are a hot wife, you do it when I'm not around you're a slut." 

I swung around and buried my face in her cunt and went to work on her clit. I gave her a small orgasm with my mouth and then I moved and got between her legs. I looked down into her face and said: 

"I could never hate you. There isn't anything you could do that would make me hate you." I pushed my cock into her. "Push that pussy up at me like you would have shoved it up on Jake's cock. Close your eyes and imagine that it is Jake fucking you." 

"No, no I won't. You are fucking me and that's what I want - you - only you." 

We fell asleep in each others arms. She woke me in the morning with a blow job and then we made leisurely love until it was time to get up and fix the kids their breakfast. We had a quickie that afternoon while the kids were playing at the park and then made love twice more that night. Candy went off to work on Monday morning secure in the knowledge that what ever game she was playing at was still working. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I hung up the phone and turned to stare out the window at the shop floor. I had made the call to verify something that had been on my mind all weekend. When the call was answered I asked for Jason in the mailroom. 

"Mailroom? I'm sorry, but we don't have a mailroom." 

"Then let me speak with Jason please." 

"There isn't anyone here named Jason. Are you sure you have the right number?" 

"Is this XYZ Enterprises?" 

"Yes, but we don't have a Jason working here." 

"Then please connect me with Marv Pallister." 

"You must have the wrong number sir. There is no Marv Pallister employed here." 

"Sorry. I'm must have gotten my wires crossed somehow." 

After lunch I called XYZ again and asked for Candy. When I got her I told her that I was going to be working late that night and then I called Mellisa, the girl we used for a baby-sitter and asked her if she would watch the kids on Wednesday night. When I got off work I went to the bar where we had picked up Candy's car on Saturday. I asked the bartender if he had been working Friday night and he said he had been. I slid a twenty across the bar along with a picture of Candy and asked him if he remembered her. 

"Oh yeah. You don't forget something that looks that nice." 

"What can you tell me about the man she was with?" 

"I didn't see her with no man. She and three other girls sat over there at that table near the end of the dance floor and shot the shit until they left." 

"Do you remember what time she left?" 

"As I remember it was close to ten." 

I stopped at the Goodwill store on Abbey and bought a few things and then I went over to the Apollo Lounge and checked it out for dark corners and good vantage points. 

That night in bed as Candy fondled my cock she said, "I might have another candidate." 

"Oh?" 

They let Jason go for calling in sick too often. The guy they hired to replace him is kind of cute. If he stops with us on Wednesday I might take a shot at him." 

"All I can say is good luck. Another young guy?" 

"About the same age as Jason was." 

"You have a thing for young guys?" 

"Well, they do say the young ones recover fast and can go on and on like the Energizer Bunny." 

"Fast recovery and long lasting is what you are looking for?" 

"I want to give you a good show." 

"Works for me." 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Wednesday evening found me sitting in a dark corner of the Apollo when Candy came in and sat down at a table. Within minutes there were four other girls and three guys sitting at two tables shoved together. I was confidant that if Candy looked my way she would not recognize me. I had on a wig and some old clothes that I had picked up at the Goodwill and with a pair of glasses with the lenses punched out and a ball cap she would be hard put to pick me out.  

===

I watched as the group drank, danced to the jukebox and talked. The three guys (none of them young) took turns dancing with the five girls and I noticed that none of the guys held Candy real close and none of their hands appeared to go where they shouldn't. 

Around eight the group began to break up and soon there was only Candy and one other woman and they got up from the tables and moved over to an empty booth. The two of them sat there talking until nine and then they both got up and left. I gave them a minute and then I got up and followed them out. They got in their cars and drove out of the lot and I got in my car and followed along behind Candy. She drove to a Denny's and went inside and the other woman joined her about two minutes later. They sat in a booth and talked over coffee and pie and at ten-fifteen I gave up watching and went on home. 

I paid off Mellisa, undressed and got into bed with a book and started reading. Twenty minutes later I heard Candy come home. And five minutes later she came into the bedroom, saw me awake and smiled. 

"Good! I hoped you would be awake. I'm horny baby and I need you to take care of me." 

She quickly undressed and got on the bed with me and pulled down the sheet to expose my erection. She giggled when she saw the hard on and she reached and took it in her hand and began to stroke it. 

"Were you lying here having nasty thoughts about what your nasty little wife was out doing tonight?" 

She lowered her head and took my cock into her mouth and sucked on me for maybe a minute and then she moved over me and took my hard dick into her tight box. 

"I was a bad girl tonight baby. I seduced that poor young boy. Well, not all the way, but almost. I'm going to take it slow with him baby. I don't want to scare him off like I scared off Jason. I went out to the parking lot with him baby. We sat in his car and swapped tongues and then I let him suck my tits and finger my pussy while I gave him a hand job. He has a pretty good sized cock baby and I really wanted to suck it. I almost did. My mouth was only an inch or so away when I remembered Jake. I promised myself that after Jake there would be nothing but hand jobs unless you were there. I almost broke that promise to myself baby; I was only an inch away and I really did want it in my mouth." 

I said, "You slutty little whore" and I rolled and pinned her under me. "Nobody likes a cock tease" I gasped and I drove myself into her and started to fuck her hard. "Next time suck his cock. If that doesn't make him want to follow you home nothing will." 

I pounded hard into her and Candy moaned and gasped as she had an orgasm and seconds later I had mine. I pulled out of her cunt and moved up so that my cock was close to her mouth. 

"Suck it slut! Suck it like you will suck his the next time you take him out to the parking lot." 

She did and when she had me hard we went one more time before falling asleep in each others arms. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Candy has no intention of ever doing another man while I watch. She knows that I would like her to from the magazines she found in my tool box, but since she isn't going to do it she is doing what she hopes is the next best thing and that is the modified role playing that she is doing. 

I have no doubt that since I told her to suck off the kid from the mailroom she will tell me all about how she did it the next Wednesday night she stops at the bar. I don't know what her excuse will be as to why he never comes home with her, but in a week or two he will be gone. I'm equally sure that Candy won't be long in coming up with another "candidate." Meantime, what she is doing has charged up our sex life and I'm just going to sit back and enjoy it. 

I am resigned to the fact that it is highly unlikely that I'm ever going to see Candy with another man, but I still have a small shred of hope. As much as Candy gets into this little game she is playing there is always the possibility, a small one to be sure, but still a possibility, that she may work herself into wondering what it might be like to really do it. I won't be holding my breath, but I will still keep hoping. Report_Story
