===

Author's note: Because I'm a romantic at heart I get a lot of static over the fact that the husbands and boyfriends in my stories tend to love their ladies enough to forgive them their peccadilloes. The most common comment is "Another damned wimpy husband story. Why can't you write a story about a 'real man' not some fucking wimp." All I can say is that the people who make those comments probably have never been deeply in love. Love can make a strong man stupid. Love can make a man forgive his lady of damned near anything, just as love can blind him as to what is going on where she is concerned. 

But a really strong love can turn into a really strong hate under the right circumstances. When I caught my first wife in bed with my cousin I was confused, bewildered and upset. I wondered what I had done wrong to make her do it and wondered what I could do to make things right between us. It only took the time necessary for her to say nine little words to turn everything around and plant a hate in my heart so strong that even now, thirty years later, I would still kill the bitch if I thought I could get away with it. Over the years I've thought of a thousand things that I wished I could have done to her, but never had the courage to try. Just the very thought of her makes me think dark thoughts and it is hard not to think of her at certain times, like this last Father's Day when I received cards and phone calls from the kids that we had. 

The three stories that make up The Dark Trilogy, written in the days following this last Father's Day, come from that dark place within me that she created and that her memory maintains. I haven't seen her in thirty years or spoken to her in twenty-eight, but the hate is still there and very much alive. These stories are dedicated to you Helen and may you rot in hell. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

It had been a very bad three weeks for me and I didn't think that it could get much worse, but I was wrong; very, very, wrong. 

It all started when I went in for my yearly physical. I was poked and probed, x-rayed and EKGed and I gave what seemed like half the blood in my body and then went home secure in the knowledge that I wouldn't have to go through it again for at least another year. 

Two days later the doctor's office called me and told me that the doctor wanted me to have an ultra sound and a CAT scan. I asked the girl what was wrong and she told me that she didn't know that anything was wrong, just that the doctor wanted the additional tests. To make a long story shorter it turned out that I had an inoperable cancer and the doctor told me that I had, at best, eighteen more months to live. I knew he had to be wrong of course; I was only forty- eight and had never had anything wrong with me. I had never smoked, drank only socially and lived a very healthy life style. He just had to be wrong so I went for a second opinion, and then a third and then a fourth before I was finally able to bring myself to accept the fact that I was going to die in eighteen months or less. 

Once I had put denial behind me I had to face the task of telling Becky. My wife had been making my days and my nights for twenty-one years. In a lot of marriages of that length the passion wanes and the couple settles into a comfortable relationship, but that never happened to Becky and I. It seemed like every year my love for her grew stronger and the passion stayed alive. We were still making love three and four times a week at a time when a lot of our friends were only having sex twice a month. 

I debated not telling Becky, at least until the pain got so bad that I couldn't hide it, but in the end I decided that she needed to know. She needed the time to emotionally prepare herself for what was coming so after several weeks of stalling I worked up the courage to face her. I didn't want the kids around when I broke the news to her so for the first time ever I took an unscheduled afternoon off from work and headed home. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

There was a strange car in the drive when I got home. I noticed the dealer plates on the car so I knew that my best friend Jerry was probably there and I wondered what he could possibly be doing at my house in the middle of the afternoon. I got the answer to that question as soon as I opened the front door. 

"Oh god, oh sweet fucking Jesus" rang through the house. "Harder damn it, fuck me harder" Becky cried as I stood at the bottom of the staircase and looked up toward the second floor where our bedroom was. I stumbled up the stairs like a man with a headful of fog as I listened to my wife beg my best friend to push it in deeper, pound her harder and make her cum. When I reached the top of the stairs I couldn't make my feet move any farther and I sat down on the top step and listened to what came from my bedroom. The doctors had given me eighteen months, but I died that day as Becky's cries of pleasure resounded through the house. And then the loud cries and screams stopped. 

"In all the years we have been fucking I don't believe I've ever seen you have as strong an orgasm." 

"Your cock brings out the best in me lover. I love it and I can never get enough of it." 

"Then why in the hell won't you leave Bob and come with me?" 

"We've covered that ground Jerry. I love your cock and the way you make love to me, but I don't love you. I like you, but I don't love you." 

"So what? You don't love Bob either." 

"You're wrong Jerry, I happen to love my husband deeply." 

"Bullshit baby. There is no way you could do to him what you do if you really loved him. No way on God's Green Earth you could let him eat your pussy with my cum still in it. No way you could keep giving him sloppy seconds and tell him to slurp up my cum and then tell him the wetness is just you being horny for him. No baby, you don't love him. If you truly loved him you couldn't do any of that. In fact, if you truly loved him you wouldn't have been fucking me for these last five years." 

"You're wrong Jerry, I love Bob, but he just isn't sexually satisfying. As for what I do with him after I've been with you, all I can say is that it excites me and in turn I do my level best to fuck his eyes out." 

"Still, I..." 

"Leave it alone Jerry before you piss me off. Are you going to get hard for me again or not?" 

"Use your mouth to get me up again baby and I'll fuck you until you make me leave." 

As I quietly left the house I was hearing Becky's words, "I love Bob deeply" and I was thinking 'big fucking deal. To be loved deeply by an unfaithful whore doesn't do a whole hell of a lot for me.' I went back to my office, closed the door and locked it and then spent the rest of the afternoon wondering what the fuck I was going to do with the short time I had left. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I still had no idea of what I was going to do when I went home that night, but I did know that I wasn't going to let Becky know that I knew what she had been doing behind my back. Even though Becky had been the light of my life my discovery of what she and Jerry had been doing had turned that light off. If I had another twenty-five or thirty years left to live I might have just turned my back and walked away from her. Unfortunately for Becky and Jerry the bitterness I felt from knowing that my time was short combined with the bitterness of finding out how the two of them had betrayed me had instilled in me a major desire for revenge and until I could take that revenge Becky had to keep thinking that things were fine between us. 

Becky was in the kitchen fixing dinner when I got home. When I walked into the kitchen she went to the fridge and took out a pitcher of margaritas and poured one for each of us. She brought me mine and as she handed it to me she leaned forward to kiss me and it was all I could do to keep from shoving her away from me as the lips that had so recently been wrapped around Jerry's dick touched mine. I didn't fight it as she slipped her tongue into my mouth and as it flicked against mine I wondered if she had taken Jerry's cum in her mouth that afternoon. 

She dropped a hand down and rubbed my cock and said, "Would you rather have dessert before dinner? I've been hot and horny all day and you won't believe how wet I am." 

"Where are the kids?" 

"Charlie has softball practice and Barb stayed after school for cheerleader try outs. We have at least two hours before they come home." 

"Then I guess we will have dessert before the main course." 

Becky gave me a wicked smile, "Some how I just knew you would say that. Come on lover, race you to get naked and up to the bedroom." 

Once naked Becky sat down on the edge of the bed, spread her legs and said, "Come on lover, see how wet just thinking about you makes me." 

It was 'moment of truth' time for me. I'd done it countless times before, but then I had believed the bullshit about it being her natural juices caused by her thinking of me and what we would do as soon as we got to bed. That was then and this was now and now I knew that she had been feeding me Jerry's cum for years. On the one hand it hadn't killed me and intellectually I knew that it wouldn't hurt me this time either, but this time I knew what it really was and I was afraid I might react badly, maybe even toss my cookies. It was all mental and I knew it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was sucking Jerry's cock by proxy and that was making my stomach queasy. It was expected of me and I needed to keep Becky thinking that everything was normal so I screwed up my courage and went to my knees in front of her. 

I spread the lips of her pussy with my fingers and for the first time I noticed that her wetness had a pearl grayish white color to it, just like the cum that came out of my own cock. I wondered why I hadn't ever noticed it before and I guessed that it was because I had never really looked. I leaned forward and drug my tongue down the length of her slit and she shuddered and moaned. 

"Oh god baby, I love that so much and you do it so well, promise me that you will never stop." 

I remembered an old perfume commercial from years ago, "Promise her anything, but give her Arpege" and promise her anything I would. I took my mouth from her unfaithful cunt and said, "I promise my love." I would promise, but I was damned well going to give her something else. I don't know why, since I had never done it before, but this time I was determined to eat Becky until she came just to give her something to miss when it was over between us. I went to work on her cunt like there would only be a tomorrow if I made her cum. I fingered her pussy, sucked her clit and even worked a finger into her asshole and finally she screamed out, "Oh my god! Oh god, so good, so fucking good." 

Her body shuddered and she got glassy eyed there for a minute and then she relaxed and fell back on the bed. "Jesus baby, that was something else. We have to try that again. Give me your cock lover, fuck me now, fuck me hard and then I'll suck you off and we can do it again." 

I did, she did and then we did do it again and I was just coming in her for the third time when Charlie got home and hollered, "Hey, where is everybody. I pulled out and whispered, "We can finish this later, but I guess we have to be good parents and feed the kids." 

That night she grabbed my cock as soon as we got in bed and went down on me and gave me one hell of a blow job and after I'd pumped a gallon down her throat she cuddled up next to me and whispered, "I do so love you Robert and you can't know how many times I thank God that you are mine." I lay there and held her while I thought, "You worthless fucking whore." 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning as I read the morning paper over breakfast I read an article on prostitution and what the city was trying to do about it. It had several case histories about repeat offenders and one particular case caught my attention and suddenly I knew what I was going to do to Becky and Jerry. It took a little work to make it happen and it took a large chunk of cash, but happen it did and I settled back to wait. 

The wait was fairly active for me because after making Becky cum by eating her worthless cunt she seemed to want a lot more sex. I knew that I was still getting sloppy seconds following Jerry and that I was licking his cream out of Becky's box, but I didn't care anymore. It wouldn't be for much longer if things went the way I hoped they would. 

Almost six months went by and then one day I came home from work to find a very upset Becky sitting at the kitchen table with a bottle of vodka in front of her and a half full glass in her hand. I'd just bought the bottle and it hadn't opened it so it was apparent that Becky had been drinking for a while. I asked her what was wrong and she looked away from me. 

"There isn't any easy way for me to do this and you are going to hate me, but I have to tell you now on the off chance I haven't given it to you yet." 

"Given me what?" 

"I haven't been feeling well lately and I went to see the doctor last week. The test results came back today. I have AIDS. I'm praying to God that I haven't given it to you. You need to go in and get checked as soon as possible." 

"I don't understand. How could you possibly have AIDS? Are you doing drugs or something like that and sharing needles?" And then I stopped talking and acted as if a thought had just entered my head. "Oh. Oh my God. Another man? Is it another man?" 

She looked away and I saw a tear run down her cheek. "Is that it Becky? You've been cheating on me with another man?" 

She gave a loud sob and got up and ran from the room. If she had turned and looked back she would have seen me standing there with a smile on my face. I gave her a few minutes and then I followed her. 

She was lying on the bed crying and I sat down on the floor and leaned back against the wall and waited. Eventually the crying stopped and I said, "I need to know Becky, what has been going on?" 

It all came out in a rush. She told me how she had gotten drunk at a party and Jerry had let Jerry seduce her. She told me how exciting it was to have sex with me after having been with Jerry and she told me that she didn't love him, but she did love what he could do for her sexually. 

"Honest to God Bob, I love you. You are the only man I have ever loved. All Jerry was to me was sex and the sex I had with him made the sex I had with you so much better. Please Bob, you have to believe me, I love you, not Jerry." 

"So the bottom line here is that you have been fucking the man who is supposed to be my best friend and he gave you AIDS which you have probably given to me. Does that about sum it up?" 

Becky started crying again and I got up and left the room. 

I slept in the spare bedroom that night and in the morning I left the house without eating breakfast or saying a word to Becky. At lunchtime I went home expecting to catch Becky and Jerry together, but Becky was alone. As soon as I walked in the door she asked, "Why are you home at this time of the day?" 

I didn't want her to know that I knew she had been fucking Jerry on our bed, even though I had hoped to catch them at it, so I told her that I had just come home to pack a bag. 

"Pack a bag? Why? Is the company sending you on a trip?" 

"Don't be dense Becky. After what you dumped on me yesterday you can't possibly believe that I'm going to stay in this house with you?" 

"But I told you that I don't love Jerry, that you are the only man I love. Don't leave me Bobby, I need you." 

"That's just too fucking bad Becky, because after last night I have no use for your cheating ass." 

She cried and she begged as I packed an overnight bag, but I ignored her. The last thing she said as I walked out the door was, "What should I tell the kids?" 

I turned to face her, "Tell them the truth Becky. Tell them you cheat on me with other men and that I found out and I didn't really care for the idea." 

I left and checked into a motel. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

A week went by and Becky called my office every day, but I refused to talk to her. She came down to the office once and when the receptionist buzzed me and told me that my wife was in the lobby I went down the back stairs and out the back door and went to lunch. 

It was a bad week for me. The cancer that was going to kill me was causing me a lot of pain and it was making some other changes in me. I was losing weight, but I wore clothes that would hide that fact for a while. I did my best to hide what was happening to me until the time was right. At the end of the week I checked out of the motel and went home. 

Becky must have heard the garage door opener operating because she came running to meet me as I came in the door. She threw her arms around me and said, "Oh God Bobby, I'm so glad you are home. I've been worried sick about you." She went to kiss me and I pushed her away. 

"Yes Becky, I'm home, but you can skip the happy welcome bullshit. I came home for four reasons, none of which you are going to like. First, I have been to the doctor and the tests are back so I just had to come home and thank you for killing me. Be sure to pass along my thanks to your boyfriend. Secondly, since I'm going to die from the AIDS you so generously decided to share with me I want it to be in the comfort of my own home. Next, I want to be here so you can watch me slowly die from what you gave me and lastly, I want to be here so I can watch you waste away. Since you have had the disease longer than me there is just a chance you might die before I do and I want to be able to watch it happen. With any luck I will survive you long enough to be able to stand on your grave and piss all over your headstone. Still happy to see me Becky?" 

Eyes downcast she turned and started to walk away. 

"What have you told the kids" I asked. 

She turned to face me and said, "Just that you and I were having some problems and you decided that you needed some space for a while. Why?" 

"They need to be told the truth." 

Alarm flashed over her face, "Why? What possible good could it do to tell them?" 

"It isn't a question of what good would it do Becky, it is a question of what harm can come from them not knowing. They need to know what we have and how to avoid doing anything that might give it to them. What if you fall down and cut yourself and one of them runs to help you and they get your contaminated blood on themselves. You and Charlie both have a bad habit of going to the refrigerator and drinking milk or juice out of the carton and then putting it back. Do you really want him to drink out of that carton after you? Unless of course your plan is to kill off the entire family." 

Becky turned and ran crying from the room. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I moved into the spare bedroom and began my coexistence with Becky. Not a day went by when she didn't make some effort at rekindling a relationship, but I wasn't having any of it. 

"The only reason I'm here Becky is so that daily you can watch what you did to me happen." 

Her relationship with Jerry ended when she told him that he had given her AIDS. He told her she was full of shit and that he had gotten it from her and not the other way around. Then he told he that he shouldn't have been surprised since after all she was a cheating whore. She had cheated on me with him so he didn't doubt that she cheated on him with some one else. They only talked once more when he called to tell her that she was a worthless, disease-ridden whore who had infected him. 

I had the meeting with the kids alone - Becky couldn't bring herself to face them - and I told them what was happening. They had a hard time accepting that their mother and 'Uncle Jerry' had been cheating on me and they were crushed when they found out that I was dying because of it. Following that meeting their relationship with their mother grew distant as Charlie and Barb showed their resentment at what Becky had done to me.  

===

I changed my insurance policy and made the kids my beneficiary and I also changed my will to leave everything to them. All I would leave Becky was bitter memories. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

The cancer will kill me long before the AIDS can and as it eats away at my body and I become worse Becky has to watch it happen. Every day she watches me waste away and it rips her guts out to think that her affair with Jerry is what has caused my pain. I'll tell her the truth, but not until I'm dead. 

I've left a letter with my lawyer to be given to Becky at the time my will is read. The letter spells out in detail what took place. It tells of my finding out about the cancer and coming home to break the news to her and how I found her and Jerry fucking in my bedroom and on my bed. I told her that I had died at that moment, that what she had done had destroyed my will to live and my intention to fight the cancer till the very last minute. 

The letter described how I had read the piece in the paper about the AIDS ridden prostitute who kept turning tricks even though she was probably killing her customers and how that gave me the idea on how to take my revenge on her and Jerry. It told how I had gone looking for a pimp and had paid him a thousand dollars to set me up with an AIDS ridden whore. I told how I had fucked the whore unprotected everyday for a month to get her disease and how I hoped and prayed that I would get it and pass it onto my loving wife who would in turn give it to her asshole lover. 

I'm praying that there are such things as ghosts and that as one I can be in the room with Becky when she reads that letter so I can see the look on her face. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

The clock is ticking down on me and as I write this I only have a few weeks left. Becky can't understand how I can be so cheerful and upbeat as the end nears, but she will find out soon and that knowledge is what keeps the smile on my face.

Author's note: This story will stand alone, but to understand the driving force behind it you should read the author's note in "The Dark Trilogy (1)." 

* 

It was the cliché‚ of all clichés. The husband coming home much earlier than expected and finding his wife in bed with another man and not just any 'other man', but his best friend. It wasn't supposed to happen to me. How could it? Dorothy and I loved each other. Or so I had thought. 

The day had started on a positive note. The project that I had been working on for almost six months had come to a successful conclusion. The client had signed on the dotted line and suddenly I was the star. I had single handedly increased the company's revenue by two hundred percent and the morning had been filled with people stopping by my office to congratulate me. I had cleaned up the paper work and at ten-thirty I had placed the finished package on my bosses desk. After promises of promotion and a large bonus he had given me the rest of the week off. 

"Go home and chase Dolores around the house" was how he had put it. I had to smile at that; I liked chasing Dolores around the house. I especially liked what happened when she caught me. As I drove home with my head full of images of my sexy wife I contemplated on how full and rich my life was. A beautiful and sexy wife who loved me as much as I loved her, three lovely daughters that I adored and a job that I really liked getting up in the morning and going to. Life was just so damned good. 

Dan's station wagon was parked in my drive when I got home. Dan had been my best buddy since the sixth grade. He had been the best man at my wedding and I had been his when he married Mellisa. Mellisa and Dolores had become good friends and were always going shopping and to Avon type parties together and at least once a month the two of them would get together for a 'girls night out'. Mellisa and Dolores must have had something planned that day and I saw my plan to chase Dolores around the house fade away. 

But it wasn't Mellisa who had something planned with Dolores as I found as soon as I walked in the front door. Before I could shout out, "Honey, I'm home" I heard Dolores cry out, "Oh God yes Dan, like that, just like that. Deep lover, push it in deep." 

Dan's "God, but I do so love your pussy" froze me in place and Dolores destroyed me when she said, "It's yours lover, it has always been yours." 

I have always been, at least in my own mind, a calm and rational person. For me, storming upstairs and barging in on the two of them was not an option. I had been betrayed by the woman I loved and who I thought had loved me and my best friend had also betrayed me. A shouting match and a couple of punches would not be enough to satisfy me. I turned and left the house with, "It's yours lover, it has always been yours" ringing inside my head. I had no idea what form my revenge would take, but when I took it they would never see it coming. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Once away from the house I pulled the car over and parked at the curb and sat there and thought about how I could best get back at the two of them and I finally decided that I needed more information. Three that afternoon found me sitting in the office of Sam Heinz who was a private investigator. I told him my story, signed a form giving him permission to enter my house in the course of his investigation, paid him a retainer and then left his office. 

Next I went to a jewelry store where I purchased a diamond pendant that I hoped Dolores would never see. It was important to me that Dolores not know that I knew about her and Dan or that she even suspect that I might be suspicious. The diamond would be in my pocket on the off chance that my boss might have called the house with a question on the deal I had just closed. If he had and Dolores asked where I had been I would haul out the stone and tell her I'd spent several hours visiting jewelry stores looking for just the right pendant for her. A suspicious husband wouldn't be giving her a three-carat diamond as a gift, right? After getting the saleswoman's assurance that I could return the pendant if my wife didn't like it I paid for it and headed home. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Going home to Dolores and acting as if everything was fine was one of the hardest things that I had ever done. Acting normal was a chore; I had a hard time putting strength into my hugs and steam into my kisses, but curiously, I had no problem getting erections. I found it somewhat strangely exciting to know I was fucking a whore. That was another curious thing. Our sex life had always been good and there had been no slackening in it that would indicate that she was getting sex elsewhere. I found myself wondering just how long I had been the recipient of sloppy seconds from Dolores. Sloppy seconds was just a figure of speech of course since Dolores obviously cleaned herself out after her trysts with Dan, but I did wonder how many times I had followed him into my wife. The answer to that question was shocking when I got it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was three weeks after discovering that my wife was a faithless whore that I got the report from the private detective. 

"It would appear that the affair has been fairly long standing. From available information it has been going on for at least eight years. I must warn you ahead of time that the content of the audio and videotapes will shake you to your core. My advice to you is that you destroy the tapes without looking at then or listening to them. Take my written report to your lawyer. It should be enough to get you favorable terms in a divorce action. I can't stop you from viewing the tapes since you did pay for them, but I heartily suggest that you don't." 

Human nature being what it is there was no way I was not going to look at those tapes after hearing the detective strongly suggest that I take a pass. In retrospect it would have been much, much better all around if I had taken his advice. 

There were taped phone conversations full of I love you's, I miss you's and I wish you were here with me now's and the arranging of the next meeting. The videotapes were, at least for the most part, nothing more than shoddy porn tapes. Dolores and Dan kissed, made out and sucked and fucked. They did it all including one or two things that Dolores never did with me like anal and oral sex. 

No, that isn't totally true. Dolores did suck a mean cock and she never refused to go down on me, but she never let me cum in her mouth. She would get me to the point of ejaculation and then she would finish me by hand. Not so with Dan, she swallowed every drop and then licked his cock clean. That upset me more than the anal part. Dolores and I had tried anal when we were first married and after about six months Dolores finally told me that she didn't like it. 

"It hurts me too much baby. I'll do it if you really, really want to, but I would prefer not to." 

Regular sex with Dolores was fantastic so it was no big deal to give up anal sex. Now here she was taking it up the Hershey Highway with enthusiasm. Several times she even asked for it. 

I had watched about twelve hours of video before I got to the one that Heinz knew I wouldn't be able to handle. It was the tape that had the first night of my last business trip on it. It started out like most of the others with Dolores sucking Dan's cock to get him hard enough to fuck her and then climbing on him and riding him until Dan came. Next they went sixty-nine until Dan was up again and then they fucked in the missionary position. Another blow job and they did doggie style for a while and after about five minutes of taking it from behind she asked Dan to fuck her in her ass. He slid his cock in her and she moaned out, "Yes, oh god damned yes baby. So good, so damned good." 

It took him several more minutes to cum and then they were lying on the bed breathing hard and Dolores asked Dan if he was staying the night since I was out of town and he said that he was planning on it. 

"How do you cover it with Mellisa?" 

"I just start an argument with her and sooner or later she will say something that I pretend pisses me off and then I stomp out of the house. The next day when I go home I tell her I went to my office and slept on the couch I have there." 

"She never checks up on you?" 

"Of course she does, but I tell her that I don't answer the phone after business hours and besides, if I wanted to talk to her I would have stayed home instead of storming out. It is all part of the plan for when it is time for the divorce." 

"How does that work toward a divorce?" 

"When we are ready I'll just start another argument, tell her I'm tired of all the bullshit and that I'm leaving her. It won't be a problem. No kids so there won't be any child support. She makes more at her job than I do at mine so there won't be any alimony. I'll let her have the house since I'll be living here with you. Have you decided yet when you want to do it?" 

"I wanted to wait a bit, let the girls get a little older." 

"You realize the longer we wait the harder it will be on them when we tell them that I'm their real father." 

"I have been thinking on that. Maybe we shouldn't tell them. Maybe we should wait a while and then file papers so you can legally adopt them." 

"Damn it Dolores, they are my kids and I want to acknowledge them as such." 

"If we tell them that you are their real father it will get back to Robert and then we will end up in a big fight over child support." 

"Why?" 

"You can't honestly believe that he will want to pay to support them if he knows that they aren't his." 

"If he brings it up you just tell him that it was something we told the kids to make it easier on them when we move in together." 

"What if he demands a DNA test? It will show that they are yours and given Veronica's age that will tell him how long we have been stabbing him in the back and he will probably get a lawyer and create more problems than we need. Just let it be Dan. You will be here with them doing the job of dad and in time they will come to see you as their father." 

"I still don't like it." 

"It will be all right baby. Oh look" she said as she reached for his erection, "He wants me again." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I sat there stunned into immobility as what I'd just heard registered. My three girls were really Dan's? Knowing that told me how long that Dolores and Dan had been hanging horns on me. Veronica was three weeks short of her tenth birthday and allowing nine months for the pregnancy that meant the two of them had been cuckolding me for at eleven years of my twelve year marriage. 

How in the name of God could they have been doing that? How could they have been doing that and me not notice something? Had my love for the unfaithful whore been so great that I was blinded to what she had been doing? Well, I wasn't blind anymore and it was a damned good thing the neither of them were close enough for me to get my hands on them or I would have surely been on my way to jail for murder. The murderous rage would be gone by the time I saw Dolores and I would have myself under control. I was a patient man and in time I would have my revenge on both Dan and Dolores and it would be harsh. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I did none of the things that you read about. I cancelled no credit cards, closed out no accounts and hid no assets. I did absolutely nothing that would tell Dolores that things were not right between us, but I did begin to think on what form my revenge would take. I knew one thing for certain - it would be a cold fucking day in Hell before Dan ever lived in my house! 

The first thing I did was make copies of all that I had gotten from the detective and then I rented a safe deposit box to store them in. After several days of thinking about it I finally decided on what I was going to do. The first step was to push Dolores into making a move. Knowing that she always went through the pockets of everything that went into the washing machine I put the receipt for the diamond pendant in the pocket of one of my shirts and dropped it in the laundry basket. Dolores did the laundry on Saturday, but I didn't expect her to say anything right away. She would find the receipt and think it was a gift for her and she would wait for me to give it to her. 

The next step was to start staying out late on nights that I normally wouldn't. I stopped at a drug store and bought some perfume and lipstick different from what Dolores used and put just a trace of each on the collar of my suit coat. The object was to make Dolores think I was out fooling around on her and have her confront me. I wanted her to confront me and then I would bring out her affair. She would know that I knew and had done nothing about it and that would give her a false sense of security and that is what I wanted to happen. She had to think that she had nothing to fear from me. 

It took five weeks, but confront me she did. I came home late one night and found her waiting up for me. 

"Hi sweetie, I thought you would be in bed." 

"I waited up for you Robert because we need to talk." 

"Can't it wait until the morning? I'm pretty beat and I need to get to bed." 

"No, it can't wait. There are some things that I want explained. Your late nights, strange perfume on your clothes, a lipstick color that I don't use on your shirt collar and this" and she pushed the receipt for the pendant across the table to me. 

I picked it up and looked at it and said, "Where did you get this?" 

"I found it in a shirt pocket while I was doing the laundry." 

I put the receipt in my pocket, "That was careless of me." 

"Careless? That's all you have to say, that you were careless?" 

"What do you expect me to say?" 

"Damn it Robert, I want to know what is going on. Are you seeing another woman?" 

"As a matter of fact I am." 

"You miserable rotten bastard! How could you do that to me?" 

"Whoa up there lady. Let's not be hypocritical here. You have been fucking some one else for a couple of years now and the bottom line is that if you can cheat so can I." 

"Are you accusing me of cheating?" 

"No Dolores, just stating a fact. I came home early one day and I was not even all the way in the door before I heard the two of you going at it. You're lucky I was in a good mood that day. If I had been in a bad mood I would have climbed the stairs and killed you both. But I was in a good mood so I just decided that if our marriage didn't mean anything to you, why should it mean anything to me and so I just turned and left. Shortly after that I got myself a girlfriend. I figured that I could get my quality time from her and just let you keep on whoring since going that route was cheaper than divorcing your sorry ass." 

I got up to leave and started to leave the room. "Wait just a minute Robert, we might as well get this over with right now." 

I turned and looked at her and she said, "The truth is Robert that I like you a lot, but I don't love you. I did once and I don't know what happened, but I don't love you now. I have been in love with Dan for several years now and he has been after me to leave you and marry him. 

"Dan? My best friend Dan?" 

"Yes. I have been putting this off waiting for a better time or an easier way to do it, but I now realize that there is no easier way and there is no such thing as a better time. I'm going to divorce you. I haven't seen an attorney yet, but when I do I intend to ask for the house, and custody of the girls with appropriate child support. Since I don't work and don't have any of the skills that would get me a job paying me enough to support me I'll also be asking for alimony. I want two-thirds of your savings - one third for me and one third for the girl's college fund and I want half of what you have in certificates of deposit. I'll also want a share of your pension and 401k when you retire." 

"That's it? That's all you want?' 

"I'm sure that the lawyer may have some ideas." 

"I'll just bet he will. Have you told your parents yet?" 

"No, why?" 

"There anniversary party is this Friday, remember? I think you need to keep this to yourself until after the party." 

"Yes, I suppose you are right." 

"Now that everything is out in the open you will need to move your things into the spare bedroom. As long as I'm still paying the bills I'm claiming the master bedroom" and I turned and walked away from her. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

For the next two days Dolores and I stayed out of each other's way. On Friday, just before I left for work, I told her I would be home early and to be ready to go to her parents party by six. At one that afternoon I met Mellisa for lunch and I told her what I had discovered and how long it had been going on. I gave he a copy of everything I had gotten from the private detective and then I asked her to sit on it until the next day. 

"I'm going after Dolores tonight and I don't want that sleaze bag of a husband of yours letting her know it is coming. After you break the news to him tell him to start running because I will be coming after him next." 

At six, after giving the babysitter the information she needed to get in touch with us if need be, Dolores and I got in the car to leave for the party and I saw her looking at me funny. 

"What?" 

"Nothing really, I just never saw you put on your seat belt before. I thought you didn't believe in them." 

"I don't, but Tom Baxter got pulled over for having a broken tail light and when they saw he didn't have his seat belt on they wrote him a ticket for that too. The light ticket cost him $25, but the seat belt ticket cost him $125 and the insurance company raised his rates when they ran a Motor Vehicle Records check and saw the ticket. I don't believe in them, but I can't afford those kinds of costs." 

"Well I certainly hope that you don't expect me to wear one. It would wrinkle this dress." 

"God knows we wouldn't want that to happen." 

Dolores gave me a nasty look as I pulled out of the driveway and then we rode in silence until I pulled out onto the Interstate and accelerated to the seventy-five mile an hour speed limit. Five minutes passed in silence and then Dolores said, "The other night I told you what I wanted and I was surprised that you accepted it so calmly. You didn't tell me what you wanted." 

"I have what I want Dolores." 

"Oh? What is that?" 

"I have my seat belt on and I have the air bag," I said as I turned the wheel and sent the car toward the concrete bridge abutment at seventy-five miles an hour. In the instant before we hit I saw the look on her face as she glanced at the dash and saw the indicator light that said "Passenger air bag off."

This story will stand alone, but to see where the driving force behind this dark tale comes from you need to at least read the intro to The Dark Trilogy (1). 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I found out strictly by accident. My boss had been in an automobile accident and his car had to be towed. He called me and asked me to come pick him up. As he was climbing into my car I saw my wife and my cousin Jamie walking into the Denny's restaurant across the street. Alarm bells started ringing in my head. My wife and my cousin were quite verbal about their dislike for each other so what were they doing together and why were they holding hands? I was not at all happy as I pondered the possible answers to that question. 

Seeing Helen and Jamie holding hands stayed with me for the rest of the day and I was not in the best of moods when I went home that night. Helen was in the kitchen fixing dinner when I got there and she came over to me and kissed me on the cheek as I got a beer out of the fridge. 

"How was your day baby?" she asked. 

"Same old, same old. Work like a dog to get a job done on time and then have some clown who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground pick it to death. How about you? Do anything interesting today?" 

Helen laughed, "Only if you call cleaning house and doing the laundry interesting." 

"Don't you ever go out of the house?" 

"No. There isn't anywhere I want to go." 

"I don't think I could stand being cooped up inside all day." 

"I don't stay inside silly, I spend a lot of time out on the deck working on my tan. And besides, if I went out I would miss my soap operas." 

"I'm going over to Jamie's for a while after dinner. I want to borrow his router. You want to come along?" 

"You know better than that baby. He's an asshole and I can't stand him. You know that." 

"Yeah, I keep forgetting." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

"I need the bits for making round corners and trimming Formica," I said as Jamie got the router out from under the workbench. 

"No problem. I'll just give you the whole case that has all my router bits in it. That way we can keep them all together. That do it?" 

"Yeah, that's all I should need." 

"You want a beer?" 

"I could use one." 

Half an hour later sitting at Jamie's kitchen table I said, "Can you tell me something cuz? Why can't you and Helen get along?" 

"Truth time?" 

"Anything else wouldn't mean spit." 

"She's a stuck up bitch and I can't stand to be around her." 

"Too bad. It bugs me that my two favorite people can't get along." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

It wasn't as expensive as I had thought it would be or as difficult to do as I had expected and two days later I had a voice activated tape recorder hooked up to the phone line. The next day when I got home from work I waited until Helen was doing the dinner dishes and I went and got the tape out of the recorder and put in a fresh tape. In my basement workshop I put the tape into a tape player and listened to the days phone calls. One call from her mother, two calls from telephone solicitors and then: 

"Hello?" 

"Hi baby." 

"Good morning lover, miss me?" 

"You know I do." 

"When am I going to see you again?" 

"I can't get off work today so it won't be until tomorrow." 

"God baby, it isn't fair. I'm so horny right now that I could just scream. I need your cock lover, and your fingers and your tongue." 

"You will just have to wait until tomorrow or settle for Bob when he gets home from work." 

"But he doesn't light me up like you do." 

"Sorry love, but I just can't get there before tomorrow." 

"Well you had better take a lot of vitamins between now and then because I'm going to wear you out when you get here." 

"Promise?" 

"Oh yeah baby, I promise." 

"Going to suck my dick?" 

"I'll take it so far down my throat the head will be looking at the polish on my toenails and then I'll swallow every last drop." 

"Will your pussy be hot?" 

"Hot and steaming lover." 

"What else?" 

"I'm going to take your beautiful cock up my ass." 

"Ooooh, nasty little girl." 

"Yeah, but I'm your nasty little girl." 

"I'll see you tomorrow about nine." 

"I'll be waiting and my pussy will be dripping." 

"Love you baby." 

"Love you too. Bye." 

I sat there staring at the tape player and trying to hold my rage in check. The fucking whore could swallow every drop of his, but she spit mine out into a rag? She could take him up the ass, but if I wanted to try anal I was a fucking disgusting pervert? I didn't light her up? Well we would just fucking see about that. I'd light the stupid bitch up and then I'd watch her burn. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I did my best to stay composed as I went back upstairs. "I need to run to home depot to get some Phillips head screws. You need anything while I'm out?" 

"Not that I can think of, but hurry back; I'm feeling a little frisky tonight." 

"Now that is what I call incentive," I said as I was thinking' you worthless fucking whore.' 

I managed to get to Radio Shack before they closed and I bought another voice- activated tape recorder and then went back home. Helen was in the shower when I got there so I hid the recorder where I thought it would pick up most of the sound, but still stay hidden. On a whim I changed the tape in the recorder hooked to the phone line and then I went down into I went down to my workshop to check it out" 

"Hello?" 

"Hi lover. I just had to hear your voice again." 

"Bob not there?" 

"He just left to go to home depot. I told him to hurry back if he wants to get lucky tonight." 

"You going to let him fuck my pussy?" 

"I have to lover, you know I do. If I cut him off he would get curious and he might start digging and we can't have that, now can we?" 

"How long you going to make me wait before you leave him for me?" 

"One more year baby, just one more year. As soon as he gets vested in his pension plan so I can get half of it in the divorce." 

"That doesn't make sense baby. The lawyer already told you he would get you the house and half of everything else. Why are you stalling over a pension that he can't begin to draw on for another twenty-five years?" 

"It is the principal of the thing lover. I earned it for having to put up with him." 

"You going to be thinking of me while he is fucking you?" 

"I always do baby." 

"Don't cum for him. Fake an orgasm if you have to, but don't cum for him. Save it for me when I come over tomorrow. My cock is already hard just thinking of what we are going to do when I get there." 

"I know baby, my pussy is dripping just talking to you. I need you baby, I need you bad. Get here as soon as you can. Got to go now before Bob gets home. Goodnight baby, I love you." 

"I love you too baby, see you tomorrow." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

That night I found out how thin the line between love and hate can be. In the time it took me to listen to that afternoon's tape I went from worshiping the ground that Helen walked on to wanting to put my hands around her throat and squeezing until she turned purple and died. But prison did not appeal to me (I had been there and done that and did not want to do it again) so I forced myself to put on a calm front while I figured out what to do about the situation. 

The rage had to go somewhere and where it went was into the head of my dick. When I got in bed with Helen that night I just grabbed her and took her. No foreplay, no hugs, no kisses, just slam it into her and fuck. I wanted to hurt her; I wanted to punish her and somehow my cock understood that. I couldn't cum! My cock wouldn't let me. I stayed hard and slammed it into Helen. Ten, fifteen, twenty minutes went by and I kept pounding into her. She was yelling, crying, moaning and holding onto me so tight that I couldn't have gotten away from her if I had tried. The next day I had bruises on the backs of my legs where her heels had drummed and I had claw marks all over my ass cheeks and back. 

Finally, gasping for breath, I came and wonder of wonders, Helen came at the same time - a first in our marriage! After lying next to each other and gasping for breath for several minutes Helen said, "What was that all about?" 

"I just felt the need for straight-assed animal sex." 

"I hope you don't make a habit of it. It is a little on the rough side." 

"Sometimes rough is good. You seemed to enjoy it." 

"I loved it, I just don't want to make a habit of it. Maybe once every couple of weeks or so. Otherwise I might have trouble walking." 

"I guess that means you don't want to suck my cock and get me hard so we can go again?" 

"Sorry baby, but you did a number on my poor pussy and it is just a touch sore." 

I didn't want to hear that - I wanted it to be real sore, so sore that Jamie wouldn't get much enjoyment out of it the next day. Maybe next time I thought as I rolled over and pretended to go to sleep. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Helen was fixing my breakfast and packing my lunch as I took my morning shower. Just before going downstairs I turned the sound activated tape recorder on. There wasn't any talk over breakfast and when I got up to go to work Helen leaned over to kiss me goodbye and I turned my face away and headed out. 

I spent the entire day at work saying "Why me Lord, why me" to myself. How could a woman that I loved so much do to me what Helen was doing to me and with a goddamned family member for Christ's sake! I thought about what she had said to Jamie about my pension, "I earned it for having to put up with him." What had I done to give her an attitude like that? Whatever it was it wouldn't hold a candle to what I was going to do to her. Helen and Jamie were going to find out that I didn't get mad, I got even and then some. 

When I got home from work that night Helen was still sunning herself on the patio so I hurriedly got the tape out of the recorder attached to the phone and out of the recorder in the bedroom. I took them down to my basement workshop and put the phone tape into the player: 

"Hello?" 

"Hi lover, did I get you up?" 

"You always get me up baby, you know that." 

"Silly, you know what I mean. Are you fully awake and ready to fuck my brains out? He just left and my pussy is starved." 

"Didn't you give him some pussy last night?" 

"Yes, but he wasn't any good, as usual. But he is acting strange. I wonder if he suspects something." 

"Have you given him any reason?" 

"Not that I can think of." 

"Just be careful. Keep on pretending that you love him, give him a little pussy every once in a while and you should be okay. But it is one more reason why you should hurry up and get out while you can still do it on your terms." 

"I told you lover, I'm not leaving until I can claim half of his pension. Now will you hurry up and get over here?" 

"Eager for some cock?" 

"Not just cock lover, your cock." 

"On the way sweetie. Bye." 

"Hurry lover, bye." 

I thought back to the morning when I had avoided Helen's kiss. I was going to have to watch things like that. I had to keep her thinking that I was still her loving husband. She and Jamie had to go on thinking that I was just some stupid dumb shit cuckold. 

After listening to the phone tape I headed upstairs and went out on the patio to let Helen know I was home. Helen was lying on the chaise lounge with a towel covering her lower body. I walked over to her and bent down and kissed her. 

"Hi sweetie, what's for dinner?" 

"After our session last night I thought that I would be your dinner" and she pushed the towel away. She was naked from the waist down and she spread her legs wide. "I'm still so keyed up from last night that I'm hot and wet baby and it has been so long since you last licked my slit. Please baby, please?" 

I knew the fucking whore was wet all right and I also knew that the wetness was what Jamie had dumped in her earlier in the day and not her natural juices which is what she wanted me to believe. I knew the bitch was going to get off on having me lick up her lover's leavings and it was just one more thing that she was going to pay for when the time came. But I had to allay her suspicion that I might be suspicious and the best way to do that was to do what she wanted. No way she would think I was on to her if I was willing to go down on her. I'd done worse things in my life, and what was important to me was that she not see it coming when I lowered the boom on her ass. 

"Not here baby, let's take it to the bedroom." 

I gave her my hand and pulled her up. Then I picked her up and carried her to our bedroom. I set her down on the bed and then I pushed her legs apart and looked down at her wet pussy lips. As I looked at the wetness I wondered how many times I had sucked Jamie's juices out of her and whether or not the two of them got a chuckle out of it. Steady on Bob I said to myself as I got down and buried my face in Helen's snatch. I out did myself that night. I brought the whore to orgasm twice with just my mouth and then I climbed aboard and gave her two more with my cock before rolling over and pretending to fall asleep. 

As soon as Helen's breathing settled and I was sure that she was asleep I eased myself out of bed and went to my workshop. I put the tape from the bedroom recorder into the player and then I listened to sixty minutes worth of what my loving wife did with my cousin Jamie. I'm sure that they were at it for a lot more that sixty minutes, but that was all the longer that the tape was. But I heard enough to feed the rage that had been festering in my heart. The derogatory remarks about me and my abilities (or lack of ability) in bed and comments on how worthless I was as a husband just firmed up my resolve to make the two of them pay dearly. As I climbed the stairs to go back up to the bedroom a plan was already taking form in my head. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I was younger, a lot younger, I did a very stupid thing. I got drunk one night and I stole a car and went joy riding. Being young and stupid I did not realize that when I drove that car from Detroit to Toledo I crossed a state line I had committed a Federal offense. To make a long story short I was caught, tried and convicted. 

I had the great good luck to be tried under a fairly new Federal law called the Youthful Offenders Act. Basically the YOA was a program pushed through with the thought of rehabilitation in mind. If you were between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, had no previous record and the crime for which you were arrested was non-violent in nature you could be tried under the YOA. 

The act mandated a six-year sentence, hard time and parole combined, and if you completed the sentence and kept your nose clean the conviction was expunged from your record. The sentence was called a Zip Six and you were usually sent to the Federal Reformatory at Chillicothe, Ohio to serve it. While at Chillicothe they taught you a trade, worked with you to finish your high school education if you hadn't finished school and even let you take some college courses. 

I did twenty-one months inside and the rest on parole and if you ran my prints now my record would come up clean - no record at all. While I was in I met a whole lot of people who had done a lot worse than I had and by the very nature of the place you developed friendships with a lot of people you never even would have looked at outside. Several years later I was sitting in a bar when some one tapped me on the shoulder and I turned to see a large, hulking black man. 

"Best you be careful who you be poking on the shoulder nigger," and then the two of us were in a bear hug. 

Johnny Walker had been my cellmate for seventeen of the twenty-one months that I had been inside. We moved to a table and caught up on what had happened over the last several years. He found out that I was straight and I found out that he was a drug dealer. After that meeting we had kept in touch and Johnny was the man I called on to see if my plan had merit. 

"You serious?" 

"Serious as death." 

"I can make it happen, but you best make certain sure that it is really what you want to do because once I put it in play I can't stop it even if you decide you want to." 

"No chance of that John, none at all." 

"Okay then, go ahead and set it up and give me a time table to work with." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

"I had to buy you a new Formica bit" I told Jamie, "I burned up the one you gave me." 

I handed him his router and his case of bits and he put them down on his workbench. 

"You want a beer?" 

"Yeah, I think I would like one." 

He popped the tops on two Buds and we sat down at his kitchen table. I put my briefcase on the table and opened it. I took out a set of drawings and handed them to him and asked him to look them over. 

"It is a gun cabinet that I'm going to build and I can't make up my mind what wood to use. You have any suggestions?" 

We talked for a bit about the project and then I put the drawings back in the briefcase. I looked around in it like I was looking for something and then I asked, "Have you got an envelope and a piece of paper I can borrow?" 

"I should have, let me go look." 

A minute or so later he came back with a legal sized envelope and a sheet of paper and set them down on the table. We talked some more and then he got up to use the bathroom and as soon as he was out of the room I took a latex glove out of my pocket, picked up the envelope and sheet of paper and put them in my case. Then I hurried to the family room and grabbed one of his videotapes and dropped it in the briefcase, dropped the latex glove on top of it and then closed the case. When Jamie came back I finished my beer, said goodnight and headed on home. For the next step I had to wait until Jamie's company sent him out of town on business. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

For the next two weeks I checked the tapes daily to keep up with what the two of them were up to and then what I was waiting for happened. Jamie was sent out of town on a two-day business trip and the day before he was due back I made my move against Helen. 

It was a Wednesday and I came home from work and entered the house and Helen came up to me and went to put her arms around me and I stiff-armed her. She stumbled backwards, lost her balance and fell on her ass. 

"Damn it Bob, what did you do that for? What the hell is wrong with you?" 

I ignored her and headed for the basement. She picked herself up off the floor and followed me down calling me an asshole and other things. I went into the storage area of the basement and grabbed two suitcases and when she saw that she shut up. I tossed one of them at her, "Get your miserable ass upstairs and start packing." 

"Have you gone crazy Bob? What the hell is wrong with you?" 

I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her along behind me to my workshop where I pushed her down in a chair. I hit the play button on the tape player, "Jesus Jamie, that feels so damned good. That's it lover, push that cock in my ass. Damn, but I do love you in my butt." 

I hit the stop button and said, "What is going on you cheating whore is that I'm packing you up and then I'm taking you and that tape over to your parents house. Then I'm going to play them that tape and a half a dozen more just like it for your mom and dad and then I'm going to drive off and leave your ass there. Next, I'm going to get a lawyer and get rid of your sorry ass." 

"Oh God no, please Bobby, don't do that. Please Bobby, not my mom and dad. It would kill them." 

"Good! Seeing it happen will make you suffer just that much more." 

"No Bobby, don't. It isn't what you think." 

"It is what I know Helen, not what I think. You have been fucking my cousin Jamie for God knows how long and I've got the last six weeks of it on tape." 

"Bobby please, believe me, it isn't what you think. Yes, Jamie has been sleeping with me, but it isn't because I love him. I love you Bobby, not Jamie. Honest to God Bobby, I love you."  

===

"You expect me to believe that shit after what I've listened to you saying on those tapes?" 

"It is true Bobby, honest to God. What I said I had to say to keep Jamie happy and I had to keep him happy because he was blackmailing me." 

"Over what?" 

"I got drunk at a party one night and a guy took advantage of me and Jamie took a picture of it. He threatened to show it to you unless I let him make love to me. 

"Bullshit Helen. You could have told me about it and I would have been a little pissed, but we could have worked it out." 

"I didn't think we could because more than one guy took advantage of me that night, it was three of them, and in Jamie's photos it looks like I'm willing. I wasn't, I swear to God I wasn't, but from the angles Jamie shot from it looks like I was having a good time. I wasn't Bobby, please honey, you have to believe me." 

I didn't believe her, not for one fucking minute, but part of my plan for the cheating bitch depended on her trying to convince me that she loved me and only me and that she would do anything to keep us together. 

"No Helen, I can't believe that. No way I can believe that after I heard all those things that you had to say about me and what a miserable husband I am." 

"I'll do what ever you want to prove it Bobby, anything that you want." 

"Really? 

"Yes Bobby, really. Whatever I have to do to prove to you that I love you I will." 

"Go on upstairs and move yourself into the spare bedroom. You stay there while I think on it." 

When she was gone I took out my cell phone and called John and when he answered I said, "It's a go. I'll bring her buy tomorrow morning." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning Helen was in the kitchen sipping coffee and she looked at me apprehensively when I came into the room. I looked at her for several very long seconds and then said, "I've decided what I'm going to do. You have one chance and one chance only. You do exactly what I tell you when I tell you and then we can try to put things back together. Balk at anything I tell you to do and we are on our way to see your mom and dad to visit and listen to some real fun tapes, understood?" 

"What are you going to do?" 

"You will find out when I do it. Yes or no?" 

"Yes, of course Bobby, I'll do whatever you say." 

"Good. Come on into the den." 

She followed me into the den and I pointed at a sheet of paper lying on the center of the desk pad. "Sign your first name on the bottom." 

"What is it? It is your confession. In it you admit to what you and Jamie have been doing. You sign it and it goes into a safe deposit box. If you ever fuck around on me again that confession and the tapes I have will be all that I need to get a divorce without you being able to rape me financially." 

Helen picked it up to read it and I said, "Put it down and sign it." 

"But I haven't read it." 

"Doesn't matter. Sign it or go upstairs and pack your bags." 

She put it down and signed it and then I told her to fold it and put it in the envelope lying on the desk. After she had that done I told her to get dressed, that we were going out. 

"Where?" 

"What did I tell you Helen? What I tell you, when I tell you and no back talk - do it!" 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

To understand this next part you only need to know that Helen and her family are from the South. She was born and raised in Bluefield, West Virginia and when she was sixteen the family moved north and brought their racial attitudes with them. The look on Helen's face when John answered the door was one of confusion and disbelief. She knew that I knew how she felt about blacks so why had I brought her to this place? I smiled as I thought about what was in store for her. 

"What is going on here Bobby?" 

"A little punishment Helen. You are going to be punished and at the same time give me a club that I will be able to hold over your head for the rest of your life. But first we are going to do a quick test on you for sexually transmitted diseases. John here is a doctor who lost his license when he got caught playing games with prescription drugs. He has a lab in his basement and he is going to find out if Jamie has shared anything with you. I'm not going to send you to a regular clinic because I don't want everybody else to know that I'm married to a cheating whore." 

She had the good grace to wince when I said that and she offered no resistance when I took her hand and led her to a chair and had her sit down. John came into the room with two vials and a syringe and then he carefully took enough blood to fill the two vials and then he left the room with them. I was counting on Helen being so shook up by what was going on that she wouldn't realize that there wasn't any way that John could run immediate STD tests. 

As soon as John was out of the room I said, "I don't believe one word that you have said to me Helen, not one stinking word. I think you are just stalling for time until Jamie gets home so you can run to him." 

"No Bobby, that's not true, I swear it." 

"Swear all you want Helen, but I didn't hear anything being forced on you when I listened to those tapes. In fact I heard an awful lot of you begging for what he had to offer. You swallowed his cum but you always spit mine out into a rag. You were happy to let him have your ass, but whenever I wanted to try anal you told me that it was disgusting and that I was a pervert for even wanting to try. And what about that bit about my pension?" 

"He wanted me to leave you for him Bobby. I had to stall him until I could find a way out of the mess I was in." 

"No Helen, sorry, but I just don't believe you." 

"I swear to God Bobby, I love you and only you." 

I sat there and stared at her for a couple of moments and then I said, "Okay Helen, I'm going to give you a chance to prove that you want to stay with me more than anything else in the world. You won't like it, in fact you will probably hate it, but it is what you are going to have to do to prove to me that you aren't lying to me and just trying to stall until Jamie gets home." 

"What do I have to do?" 

"You are going to fuck John while I videotape it. If you ever go near Jamie or any other man again the tape of you and John will be sent to your parents and every other living relative that you have. 

"Oh God Bobby, I can't do that, he's a nigger." 

"Exactly Helen, just what your family would love to see." 

"Please Bobby, don't make me do it." 

"Okay. Grab your purse and let's get going." 

"Where?" 

"To visit mom and dad, show them your written confession, listen to some tapes and let them know that you are moving back in with them." 

She looked at me and I saw the resignation come into her eyes and then she said, "What do I have to do?" 

"Just do what you do with Jamie and what you did with those first three guys you told me about. Suck him, fuck him with your pussy and ass and pretend that you are loving every second of it. Somewhere along the way I want you to tell John how happy you are that Jamie made you fuck him. Then John is going to say, "But what about your husband? Doesn't he care that you are a slut?" and you are going to say, The stupid shit doesn't have a clue." 

"Why would I do that?" 

"Because I said to." 

"But why?" 

"If I ever catch you with Jamie or anyone else not only will your parents see the tape but I will use it to get a divorce and the more callous it looks and sounds the better it will be for my case." 

"Please Bobby, anything else, but don't make me do this." 

"It is only another cock Helen and by now you should be used to cocks other than mine. Now, before John gets back, yes or no?" 

I saw a tear forming in her left eye and she said, "All right, I'll do it, but only to show you how far I'm willing to go to show you that I love you." 

John came back into the room while Helen was drying her eyes with a hanky and he said, "She checks out clean." 

"Good. She has agreed to her punishment so let's take it to the bedroom." 

On the way to the bedroom I said to Helen, "John's never had a white woman before and I want you to make sure that he has a memorable experience. Enthusiastic participation Helen. Anything less and we are on our way to visit your parents." 

While John and Helen moved toward the bed I set up the video camera and with my back to Helen I took a latex glove out of my pocket, put it on and loaded the tape that I had taken from Jamie's entertainment center. I took the glove off and turned around, "Okay guys, as they say on the Hollywood film sets, lights, camera, action!" 

Helen stood there while John undressed her and then she undressed him. She went to her knees in front of him and helped him step out of his trousers. His cock bobbed in front of her and John put a hand on the back of Helen's head. She knew what was expected of her and she opened her mouth and let him push it in. She might have hated blacks, but she could give great head and I had warned her to be enthusiastic and so she went to work on him. John was loving it. It took her about five minutes to get him off and when I saw the cum leak out of the corners of her mouth I knew that I was going to keep a copy of the tape. 

John pulled his limp cock out of her mouth and helped her stand up and then he pushed her back onto the bed and went down on her. He did such a good job that she either forgot that she didn't like blacks or she forgot that he was black. Her hands gripped the back of John's head and she pulled his face into her cunt. 

"Oh yes, oh yes, like that, right there, just like that" she moaned and she hunched her hips up at his face. John's cock began to grow and he redoubled his efforts on Helen's box and as soon as he brought her to orgasm he pulled his face away from her and mounted her. 

Helen grunted as John drove into her and then her legs came up and locked around his waist. 

"God bitch, but your pussy is so fucking tight. I would have thought from the way Jamie said he was always fucking you that you would be a lot looser." 

"Stop talking lover, just fuck me. Fuck me hard and make me cum. I need to cum baby, I need it bad." 

John picked up speed as he pounded into Helen and she moaned, "That's it baby, that's it, hard baby, push it deep. You feel good baby, I'm glad that Jamie is making me fuck you." 

"Damn, but you are one hot fucking slut. Does your husband know what a slut you are?" 

"The stupid fuck hasn't got a clue. Forget about him and fuck me, fuck me hard honey, fuck me hard and make me cum." 

John did make her cum and then he had her suck him hard again and he fucked her for a second time. He want to go a third time, but Helen said no. 

"No more lover, no more now. I need to beat my stupid fucking husband home." 

I turned the camera off and said, "Okay John, she's all yours now." 

John pushed Helen back down on the bed and put two fingers in his mouth and let out a loud whistle. A couple of moment's later three black men entered the room and started to undress. Helen looked at them, looked at me and then back to them: 

"Bobby? What's going on here Bobby?" 

"Just some friends of John's who have never fucked a white woman. When you are done with them they are going to show you their appreciation by taking you on a sea cruise. You have always wanted to see Africa, haven't you?" 

I saw her eyes go wide as the implication of what I'd just said registered and she started to struggle, but the three men were already on her. As I walked out of John's bedroom I heard Helen crying out, "Bobby? Bobby? For God's sake Bobby don't leave me here. Please Bobby, come back." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I collected the vials of blood from John's refrigerator and was putting them in the camera bag when John came into the kitchen. 

"She seems to have quieted down some." 

"She has a mouthful right now if you take my meaning." 

"What's the plan from this point?" 

"When they have drained themselves they will smuggle her onto their ship and by this time next month they will have sold her to some whore house in some godforsaken African country. There is a nine man crew on the ship and she will be well broken in by the time they sell her off." 

"Thanks bud, I owe you a big one. Now I'm going to take care of my asshole cousin." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I had a key to Jamie's place and he had one to mine. Whenever one of us would be gone for more that a couple of days, like a vacation maybe, we kept an eye on each other's place. I parked around the corner from Jamie's since I didn't want my car to be seen there - not this time. Jamie never drove his car out to the airport and left it parked there. He always caught a cab downtown and then caught the airport shuttle from there. I walked to his place, put on a pair of latex gloves and let myself in and went to work. 

I went to the bedroom and taking out a vial of Helen's blood I dropped some in several places around the bed and then I got a wet rag and did a half-assed job of trying to clean it up. Next I went to the kitchen drawer where Jamie kept a spare set of keys to his car and then I went out into the garage and opened the trunk of the car. Right where Helen's head would have been had she been stuffed into the trunk I poured some blood out of the vial onto the trunk mat. I took some of Helen's hair out of a little plastic bag and dropped them into the trunk and then closed it. 

I splashed some of the remaining blood on the floor in a line from the door into the house to the trunk of the car and then I got down on the floor and did a shitty job of trying to clean it up. I put the rags in a trash bag and then pushed the bag down to the bottom of a garbage can. Lastly I took the letter that I'd had Helen sign and I put it together with the videotape under the front seat of the car and then I locked the place up and went on home. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day I took a half-day off work to go to a doctor's appointment. There was nothing wrong with me, but I needed the cover for the day. I needed to be home when Jamie called and I needed to be there in case he decided to come by. If he did he would see my pickup and keep on going. The first call came around noon: 

"Hey babe, you there? Pick up the phone lover. Okay, I'll try later." 

An hour later he called again: 

"Helen? You there? Answer the phone babe. I'm back and I'm horny as hell and I want to come over." 

One more call came in at three: 

"Helen? Damn it, where are you?" 

That was enough to suit my purpose and I turned off the answering machine. I sat at the front window and watched, but Jamie never drove by. At five I left the house and drove over to Jamie's and acted as if I was just stopping by on my way home from work. We had a beer and I asked him if he had given any more thought to what I should build my gun cabinet out of and we talked about that for a bit and then I said that I needed to get home to Helen. 

Five minutes after getting home I called Jamie on the phone and after the greetings were out of the way I said, "Jamie, just what the fuck have you been up to?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"What I mean is that Helen isn't here and there is a message from you on the answering machine saying that you are horny and want to come over. What the fuck is going on?" 

"Hey man, I don't know what you are talking about" he said and I hung up on him. 

I jumped back in my pickup and drove over to Jamie's and when he answered the door I pushed past him, "Where is she?" 

"Where is who?" 

"Don't give me any of that shit. You know damned well who. She isn't at home and I have three calls on the answering machine from you and one of then says that you are horny and want to come over." 

He protested and I ignored him and I went through his place room by room. I even looked under the bed and in the closets and behind the shower curtain. "Satisfied?" he said as I was getting ready to leave. "Not by a long shot cousin, not by a long shot." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I drove home and watched TV for a while and then I called the police and reported my wife missing and then I told them that I suspected foul play. I told the cops when they got there that Helen had not been home when I got there. I played them the tape from the answering machine for them, told them whose voice it was. 

"I don't know about you, but that third call sounds pretty angry to me. I drove over to his place expecting to catch my wife there with him. I didn't find her but I did see what I think were blood stains on his bedroom rug." 

After that things happened fast. The police paid Jamie a visit with a search warrant and in no time they found the blood on the carpet, on the garage floor and the blood and hair in the truck of his car. They found the letter and the tape under the front seat of the car. The letter had only Jamie's and Helen's finger prints on it and the tape was covered with Jamie's prints. The letter said: 

Jamie, 

I'm putting this in a letter because I'm too scared to tell you face to face. I remember how bad you beat me the last time and I don't want it to happen again. I warned you to use condoms, but you wouldn't and now I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do. I won't have an abortion like you made me do the last time. Damn it Jamie, what am I going to tell Bob. We both know he is sterile so he is going to know that the baby isn't his. I'm scared Jamie. What are we going to do? 

Helen 

The only question the detective had for me was why she would type the letter out on a computer, why hadn't she hand written it? I showed him a sample of her handwriting. It was barely legible. 

"If she wanted him to understand what she wrote she had to type it out. Her printing isn't any better." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

It is very hard to get a murder conviction without a body and Helen's was nowhere to be found. But they had circumstantial evidence up the kazoo and it was enough for the jury. I was sitting in the courtroom the day Jamie was found guilty and I was there the day he was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole. 

Occasionally I wonder who got the worst of the deal, Jamie or Helen, but then I have to smile because I really don't give a shit because I do know who got the best of it. Report_Story
