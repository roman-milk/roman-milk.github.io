title: For The Love of Adele

#1 

===

I often wonder that if Adele, my aunt, hadn't forgotten her sunglasses that day, then would things have turned out as they have? After all, if she'd remembered to bring the glasses up to the sundeck there would have been no need for me to take a trip down to her cabin and collect them. If I hadn't gone to my aunt's cabin I never would've found the dildo and the book of erotica... And if I hadn't made that little discovery, my mind wouldn't have been filled with the images that followed; images of my lovely aunt using the rubber cock on her tight pussy... 

But, she did forget the sunglasses, and I did take that walk. The rest is history. 

My parents have always been well off. Not quite rich, but decidedly wealthy, wealthy enough to treat me to a celebration cruise around the Mediterranean when I completed my degree. As the fates would have it my girlfriend, who was also supposed to be coming along on the cruise, ditched me two weeks prior to the departure date and it was decided that Aunt Adele, my mother's sister, would come along instead. 

It didn't take much in the way of administrative juggling and as we set sail from Southampton all that separated my aunt's cabin from mine was a connecting door. I didn't realise at the time just how much of an influence that door was going to have on my life. In fact, I'd say that that door was as much a factor in what followed as the initial discovery I made when collecting Aunt Adele's sunglasses from her cabin. 

*** 

It took almost a week before the weather picked up enough for Aunt Adele to go sunbathing. I was bored shitless by that time. I was looking for adventure; I was free for the first time in four years. I had no studies to think about and no girlfriend to keep me on the ground. The cruise had seemed like a great idea, but apart from one or two available honeys there wasn't much on board for a randy tom cat like me. I couldn't wait for the warmer climes of the Balearics and the Eastern Med. 

'Shit,' my aunt swore. 'I don't believe it. I've left my sunglasses in the cabin.' 

I said nothing. I'd just smeared handfuls of sun lotion into Aunt Adele's back. We were both up on the sundeck and making the most of the first full day of sunshine, or so I thought. 

'I really need my sunglasses,' Adele whined. 

I sighed. It would be no problem for me to just slip on my flip flops and go down to her cabin and collect the fucking glasses. I knew that my aunt was reluctant to move again after being so precisely oiled. Also, I knew she was far too conscious of her exposed body to wander through the corridors below deck in her bikini. It was obviously a time for chivalry. 

'Do you want me to go, Aunt Adele?' I asked already knowing the answer. 

'Yes please,' she replied. 'Here's the card, they should be on my bedside cabinet.' 

I took the keycard and made my way through the labyrinthine twists and turns of the cruise ships decks until I came to my aunt's cabin door. I let myself in and went straight to the cabinet expecting to find the sunglasses easily enough. I found the glasses, but also made another discovery, one that made me sit on the bed in a virtual trance. 

I pulled open the middle drawer of the bedside cabinet by mistake. I was just about to close the drawer when I noticed something unusual poking out from under a pile of innocuous underwear. I reached in and was surprised to find a large rubber penis waggling in my hand. 

'Jesus,' I thought to myself... 'Aunt Adele!' 

I was shocked... I was taken completely by surprise. Of course I knew about such things, but I hadn't expected a face to face under these circumstances. My aunt was a divorcee of about two years standing, but even so, the discovery of her dildo had knocked me for six. Then I found the book. 

Aunt Adele obviously enjoyed a little read while she used the rubber cock on herself. The volume I found in the drawer was full of erotic goings on between masters and servants, teachers and pupils, mature women and young men... I read a few lines of several chapters and became quite immersed in the lewd, lascivious goings on. The mental image of my aunt, reading this very book and masturbating grew quickly vivid in my mind. 

I realised what I was doing and came to my senses. I stuffed the book and the dildo back in their drawer, found the glasses and left the cabin behind. It took the walk back to the sundeck before my erection subsided enough to enable me to put in an appearance with some degree of propriety. 

'Thank you,' Aunt Adele smiled at me and took the sunglasses from me. I couldn't look at my Aunt as she reclined on the sunchair, all oiled and shining. The mental picture of her flashed repeatedly across the screen behind my eyes whenever I tried to relax and enjoy the warmth of the sun. Aunt Adele's semi nude close proximity didn't help either, which prompted my excuses and forced me to leave her to sunbathe alone. 

I tended to avoid my aunt after that. I tried my best to miss her at mealtimes, and also made up excuses for missing excursions when the ship docked at various ports. Looking back, it must have been obvious to Adele that I was avoiding her. We'd been pretty friendly before the day I'd visited her cabin, but now, suddenly, it was as though she'd caught some dreaded, contagious disease. I couldn't keep far enough away. 

Of course my self imposed exclusion zone didn't include my bed. I found that when I was alone in my cabin at night I would begin to fantasise about Adele, just a few feet away in her cabin, separated by the adjoining door... 

In spite of the self loathing I inevitably felt for lusting after my own mother's sister, I would masturbate ferociously and imagine my aunt using that obscene rubber phallus as she read her erotica in bed. I envisaged how her hot, swollen pussy would look as she slowly slid the length of the cock into her body. I could hear the sound her undoubtedly dripping sex would make as the dildo squelched against her slippery, juicy cunt as well as her soft sighs and minute mewls of pleasure. In my mind's eye I saw her long, thick, scarlet nipples begging to be sucked... God, I was desperate for my aunt... and my semen gushed urgently from my cock end and pooled thick and shiny on my belly as I panted in that post masturbatory bliss, a momentary respite from the desire I felt for Adele. 

'Is everything okay, Russ?' my aunt asked one evening as we both climbed into a Cypriot taxi, bound for Ayia Napa. 

'Sure, everything's fine,' I replied evasively. I squirmed uncomfortably under Adele's scrutiny. I'd only taken the ride with her so that I could get into the lively resort. I intended to find a group my own age, or maybe even get off with a hot little holiday maker at the earliest opportunity, Adele could look after herself. 

'You've really been funny lately.' Adele wouldn't let it go. 'I hope I haven't done anything to upset you.' 

I looked at my aunt. I felt more than a little guilty; after all, she'd done nothing wrong, I was the one with the problem. So what if she used a dildo and read dirty stories, wasn't she entitled to do whatever she wished in the privacy of her cabin? She was a healthy thirty five year old woman, a divorcee with an appetite, my mother's sister perhaps, but still a woman - I really needed to get over myself! 

'You've been great,' I tried to reassure my aunt, 'really great. I think I'm just a bit wound up after my degree and all... It takes a bit of time to unwind.' 

I began to believe my own bullshit, and it seemed to put Adele's mind at rest. That was the main thing. I couldn't really blurt out that I fantasised about her... About how I pictured her using the thick, rubber cock against her silky, sodden sex... 

'Jesus,' I stopped myself from wandering further along the corridor of incestuous imagining. 'She's you're aunt, for fuck's sake... behave yourself.' 

The taxi dropped us of at the square and I made my excuses to Adele and left her to her own devices. I looked back and had to suppress a pang of guilt when I saw her standing all alone amidst the thronging crowd of somewhat rowdy revellers. She was a forlorn splash of familiarity against a backdrop of heaving anonymity. I looked away and then turned; I experienced a sudden, heady rush of affection for my aunt just then. I couldn't leave her alone in that place, but when I turned to find her I was too late. She was gone, swallowed up by the river of people heading for the clubs and pubs of Ayia Napa. 

I spent ten fruitless minutes searching for Adele to no avail, and eventually gave up the search. Three or four hours later I was arm in arm with a pissed up, but big busted and eager tourist en route to her hotel for a night of rampant sex. 

As we passed the less crowded bars I noticed my aunt sat on a tall stool. She appeared to be a little worse for wear on the drink, and was surrounded by three men who, in my opinion, looked less that savoury. It was obvious to me that the men were cajoling my aunt, egging her on and trying to lure her back to some hotel or other so they could take advantage of her inebriated state. 

I pulled up short and my companion gave a squawk of annoyance: 'What the fuck..?' 

'Sorry, babe...' I tried to explain. 'There's something I have to do.' 

I left the sweet young thing standing on the kerb, with her mouth hanging open. I heard her unflattering epithet, but was in no mood to take any notice of a drunken little trollop's outrage at being left on the pavement. I was too intent on the developments in front of me. How could I extricate my aunt and me from this little situation? 

'Adele!' I called and pushed into the centre of the little group. 'I've been looking for you... Jesus, you just wandered off... Are you pissed?' 

My aunt looked at me for a bleary moment and then smiled crookedly. 'Russ!' she shouted in that over the top way that drunken people have. 'Meet the lads.' 

"The Lads" didn't look too pleased to see me. They had homed in on the lone female; easy prey; and I was getting in their way. 

Adele was completely ignorant to the sudden tension in the bar. My intrusion was definitely not welcome, I could sense the palpable aura of hatred directed toward me from each of the group. I realised that I was in real physical danger here. 

'Hi Russ.' A big, shaven headed bloke smiled at me. There was absolutely no warmth at all behind that smile. I could see the man's icy stare challenging me even as he issued his faux greeting. 'Sit down,' the man mountain offered. 'Have a beer.' 

He nodded to the barman and I could tell right away that I'd get no help from the other side of the bar. As the barman opened the bottles, the bald man placed himself squarely and firmly between Adele and me. I was in the shit now. 

'I think,' the big man grinned menacingly at me after a swig from his bottle. 'I think you should just have a drink and then fuck off...' He grinned again, the empty eyed, implacable stare above that grin really made me want to pee desperately. 'The lady is having fun with us... So you just fuck off.' 

He delivered the last phrase with an accompanying poke in the ribs and I knew that this whole scene was seconds away from becoming ugly. The result was pretty certain, and probably included me being pummelled into a bloody heap, but I couldn't leave my worse-for-wear aunt with these men. 

It was just at that moment that two men in the uniform of the Royal Military Police put in an appearance. They were accompanied by their opposite number in the Cypriot Police, and after a quick analysis of the bars customers, they made straight for out little collective. 

'Evening,' one of the redcaps offered. 'Everybody having a good time?' He eyed our party suspiciously and I gave thanks for his presence. 'Where are we all from then?' he asked in a conversational tone. 

My bald companion seemed suddenly uneasy... then the penny dropped. He was a squaddie, he was in the army and quite clearly somewhere where he shouldn't have been. 

'We're from Paphos,' I offered and indicated my aunt. 'Our ship is docked there. We just came down here for a few drinks and met these guys here.' 

I took the opportunity to take Adele's hand and tried to pull her to my side. She was fairly well gone from the booze, but swayed next to me with a loose, stupid smile on her face. 

The police man looked at me, obviously noted my longer than regulation hair and decided I was telling him the truth. He turned to one of the men who had been keeping Adele occupied: 'And you, Sir? Where are you from then?' 

It was evident to me that these guys had been reported and that the police were there to take them back to wherever they came from and deal with them. I slowly eased my aunt away from the group and, once we were clear, led her outside. 

'Where did you get off to, Russ?' my aunt slurred at me she tried in vain to focus on me. 'You left me all on my own... a woman all alone... It isn't safe.' 

She was telling me? I felt a pang of guilt though and I shuddered at what might have been... Miraculously I managed to find one of the ubiquitous Mercedes taxis that wasn't gainfully employed and I bundled my blathered aunt into the back and climbed in beside her. 

The driver sped off and whizzed through the dark, Cypriot night towards Paphos, where the ship and safety lay. 

'Thanks for finding me,' my aunt murmured and wriggled close to me on the big back seat. 

She cuddled into me and rested her hand lightly on my thigh. I could feel the heat of her body, and could smell her scent and shampoo as she snuggled in close. Her hand was very close to my cock and the pressure of it, combined with the feminine scent of her, made my penis thicken with anticipation. 

I awkwardly curled my arm around my aunt's bare shoulder and I hugged her closer to me. She sighed and moved her body so that her head was resting on my lap. There was nothing I could do but sit, immobile and with my stiff cock aching in my jeans. The desire was growing inside me. I wanted my mother's sister physically. My cock ached for her and I felt a dull throb in the pit of my stomach. I ran my open palm down along Aunt Adele's body; down through her waist and over the swell of her hips until I reached the hem of her short skirt. I lightly fingered the soft skin at the top of my aunt's thigh and caressed her tight buttocks as hard as I dared. She was pretty well asleep by now, but even so, I was mindful of going too far. Hell... I'd gone too far for decency's sake as it was. Feeling your aunt's body isn't exactly socially acceptable behaviour, but I was just so excited by having her so close. 

All too soon the taxi dropped us at the harbour and I had to half lead, half carry my aunt back on board. Eventually, I got her back to the cabin and used her keycard to unlock the door. Aunt Adele was barely conscious so I pulled off her shoes and pulled her strappy top over her head. She slumped on the bed and I then pulled her skirt down over her legs and then just looked at her half naked body. 

The few days of sunshine had turned Aunt Adele's skin a light brown and gave her a healthy glow. I looked at her full, round breasts as the lovely flesh threatened to spill from the cups of her bra, and I could see the mound of her pubis clearly through the filmy front of her thong. There was no hint of any shadow through the material, so I could only assume that my aunt kept her bush trimmed or shaven. The crease of her labia was visible in the fold of the fabric and I knew I had to leave immediately before things got bad. I was already struggling to hold myself in check, but to take advantage of my aunt in her stupor would have been too vile for words. I took a final, lingering look before I clicked Adele's door closed behind me. 

*** 'What happened last night,' my mother asked at breakfast the next morning. 'Adele is still in her cabin, she looks awful... where did you take her?' 

My mother's emphasis on the "did" made me smile wryly; she was far too pompous for her own good. If only she'd seen the shit state her sister had been in the night before. 

'Hey, we got separated,' I said, palms out in supplication. 'I found her by accident... pissed as a fart, so I brought her back.' 

My father snorted in amusement but kept quiet and concentrated on his breakfast. 

'At her age...' my mother spluttered outraged. There was fifteen years difference between my mother and her sister; it may as well have been fifty. 

I ate my breakfast as quickly as was decent and then left the table. The ship was due out that afternoon and I couldn't wait to leave Cyprus and its recalcitrant British Army presence behind. I knocked on my aunt's cabin door and went in. 

'Oh, God,' Adele groaned. 'Who put me to bed?' 

'Me,' I replied quietly, my face flushing with the heat of the memory. 

My aunt looked at me in the dark of the room. 'I remember the bar... vaguely,' she stuttered. 'And I remember the taxi... after that...' My aunt shrugged and smiled weakly up at me from the bed. 'I think,' she began, 'that I should thank you. If you hadn't come along when you did...' 

Yeah,' I responded, but the cops were there pretty soon afterwards, so I didn't really do much.' 

'All the same,' Adele said quietly. 'You were still there. Those boys weren't playing. They... they wanted to take me back to their camp and...' 

She didn't need to elaborate. We both knew what the boys had in mind. I felt the creep of goosebumps when I recalled the bald man's expression as he poked me in the chest. My aunt had been swimming close to something bad alright. 

I left my aunt to her suffering and spent the rest of the day reading idly on the sundeck and drinking beers at the bar. I went back to my cabin around six o'clock that afternoon intending to get ready for the evening meal and the entertainment. 

I was just about to get under the shower when I heard a bump through the adjoining wall with my aunt's cabin. My attention had been caught by the mystery noise; otherwise I wouldn't have thought to press my ear up against the door that connected our two rooms. Why I made such a pathetic attempt to eavesdrop isn't very clear at all now, but I had a sort of 'feeling' that Adele wasn't just getting ready to go upstairs herself. I somehow knew on a visceral level that something exciting was going on just beyond the thin membrane of that wall. 

The arousal grew suddenly deep in my belly and as I looked down at the door handle I saw my hand inching towards it. I don't recall making a conscious decision to try the door handle, but while the logical part of me knew it would surely be locked tight, on another level I was feverishly imagining what possibilities lay beyond... 

My fingers curled around the cold, metallic surface and I twisted anti- clockwise. 

The handle turned! 

I was stunned; my heart hammered and I could barely breathe. What should I do? Decency screamed at me to leave it well alone. Just let the handle twist back and get away from the line I was so close to crossing. Decency could scream as loud as she wanted... the Devil on my shoulder was goading me, urging me to pull the door back and to allow me to see into Adele's cabin beyond. 

I pulled the door and was confronted by yet another door. Of course there would be two doors back to back... Damn, the disappointment bubble popped and I felt a wave of frustration at this second barrier. Maybe it was for the best? I felt a shiver of alarm when I realised fully the consequences of spying on my aunt... It was too terrible to think about. The results would have been devastating. 

I was just closing the door from my side when I noticed that Adele's door was actually ajar. The door itself could only be a few millimetres out of the jamb, but it was definitely open. Once again my heart pounded, my breathing was fast and shallow and my throat went suddenly dry. All prior thoughts about consequences vanished like a magician's sleight of hand as I gazed at that tiny, tiny gap.  

===

I pushed and the door opened slightly. I pushed a little more and was then able to see a slice of my aunt's cabin. I squeezed my eye right up as close as possible to the six inch wide gap and was instantly rewarded by a view of my Aunt Adele lying on top of her bed. It wasn't a full view of her, just a foreshortened side view, but I could see her nakedness quite clearly and I could tell by the positioning of her arm that she was using her dildo. 

The shock of what I saw flashed through me, but once that initial flare had died I could hear the soft sighs and tiny mewls of pleasure my aunt was making. I could hear the oscillating buzz of the vibrator as my aunt smeared it around her vulva and then pushed a length of it inside her body. Adele was reading her smutty tome, holding the book awkwardly with one hand while the other was busy with the toy between her soft thighs. 

Despite my restricted view my eyes drank thirstily and roved over every superb inch of my aunt's exposed flesh. I watched her thighs jerk and her hips buck with convulsive spasms as Adele grew evermore excited. I saw the profile of her lovely, big, round breasts as they trembled with her jerky movements. Adele's mouth-watering, enticing jugs were rudely tipped by her obviously excited, thickened nipples. The rubbery texture of her teats lured me like the Siren's song. I was almost physically drawn to move to Adele's bed and I had a wild, insane imagining that if I just went to her she would look up at me and smile... 

I was brought back to reality brutally by an insistent knocking at my cabin door. There was nothing I could do except to abandon my voyeur's post and answer the door. Not only did I have to leave Adele's door ajar, I had to leave mine in a similar position. Adele had already been distracted by the knocking, and I daren't push my door closed for the fear that the click of it shutting would arouse her suspicions. 

'Are you coming upstairs, Russ?' my mother asked when I opened the cabin door to her. 

'Yep,' I replied as well as I could manage under the circumstances. 'I'm just in the shower.' 

My mother left me in peace, which was a relief given my agitated state and I stared for a few moments at the accusing gap between the two adjoining doors. How the hell was I going to get my door closed before Adele noticed? 

I moved towards the doors and then halted. I turned away, but then reconsidered and turned back again. I dithered like this for a few more seconds, lost in an agony of indecision and then I heard Adele's door close gently. She had pushed it closed from her side. 

I showered and made myself presentable on automatic pilot. I was in a fugue of self absorbed anxiety. What would my aunt say? Did she know I'd been watching her? I groaned every time I thought about the situation. Why? Why had I been so stupid? I'd been led by my penis and a rush of hormones... Shit...Shit... Shit! 

*** 'There he is - My hero!' My aunt smiled at me as she took her place at the table alongside my mother. 

My stomach flipped. What did she mean? Was she being sarcastic and about to accuse me of my crimes right here and now? I needn't have worried; Adele was referring to the incident in the bar the night before. She'd spent the day in her cabin recuperating and so hadn't yet told my parents about her little escapade and subsequent narrow escape. 

I blushed while Adele insisted on how I'd rescued her from the clutches of wrongdoers, and how I'd seen her safely home. The entire meal was filled with her singing my praises, and my confused brain was having trouble keeping up. I was constantly distracted by the remembered images of my aunt masturbating on her bed. There was the burden of the dilemma I faced over the question of the adjoining doors, and whether or no my aunt knew I'd been spying. If she did know, she was hiding it well as she laughed vivaciously throughout the entire meal. 

My father slapped me heartily on the back and my mother beamed her approval, her earlier pomposity forgotten, when they'd heard the full story of my supposed rescue of my aunt. I just sat there with a sickly grin on my face and a queasy, slick feeling in my tummy. If they only knew what a voyeuristic little swine I was, and how I'd been close to wanking while watching my aunt in a moment of privacy. 

Eventually the trial of that meal was over and I walked off in search of a quiet corner where I could gather my thoughts. I hadn't gone very far when my aunt caught me up and tapped me on the shoulder. 

'Going anywhere nice?' she asked with a mischievous glint in her eye. 

'Nope, nowhere special,' I answered unable to look her in the face. 

Did she know, or didn't she? The suspense was killing me. 

'Well, I think I'll be laying off the booze tonight,' Adele said with a bright laugh. 'I had my ration last night... Which reminds me,' she continued. 'I didn't thank you properly.' 

Before I could react, and before my overloaded senses grasped what was happening, my aunt placed a light kiss on my lips. It was only a momentary touch, as light as a feather, but it was a kiss. I read an enormous amount into that fleeting touch of my aunt's bright-red, painted lips against mine. It wasn't quite a sensual kiss such as one shared between lovers, but it felt more than a Platonic moment... 

Maybe it was just my fevered imagination... I was so confused by the quandary I was in that I would probably have read more than was intended into any innocent look or gesture from my aunt. Nevertheless, we stood facing each other, inches apart and I leaned forwards slowly and placed a return kiss of my own lightly on my aunt's mouth. 

Just for a moment she returned the pressure, which was now definitely more than a Platonic sign of affection, but then Adele suddenly pulled back from me her eyes wide with shock. 

She lifted her hand to her mouth and looked at me for a lengthy moment. She shook her head quickly and without a word, turned and left me staring after her, more confused and bewildered than ever. 

I prowled the ship anxiously for a few hours. I couldn't settle anywhere. The entertainment seemed to be drab and lifeless and I couldn't concentrate for more than a few minutes at a time anyway, I was so distracted by the enigma of my aunt. 

I didn't have any yen for alcohol, so I stayed out of the bars, eventually returning to the one place I could be on my own. The one place I could shut out the intrusions of the outside world, but unfortunately it was the catch-22 of being the scene of my earlier crime. 

I closed my cabin door, took a shower in a vain attempt to wash the problem away and then tossed and turned in my bed for what seemed an age. 

I must have dozed, but didn't really fall asleep. My mind was too busy for real sleep, but I suddenly heard, or thought I heard, the metallic click of the door handle turning. I tried to peer through the dark, and was just about to flick on the light when I heard a soft, female voice: 

'Don't turn the light on...Just leave it dark.' 

'Aunt Adele?' I whispered ridiculously. Who was likely to hear me? 

'Yes, Russ... it's me.' 

I felt the bed give under her weight as my aunt sat on the edge of the mattress. 

'Wha... What do you want?' I asked stupidly. 

There was no reply, just silence. The darkness limited my sight severely and so my remaining senses were working overtime. I could hear the distant throb of the ship's engines and felt the slight sensation of gentle swaying as the big vessel cut through the calm Mediterranean night. I was also conscious of the more immediate heat from my aunt's close proximity, and I could hear her soft breathing through my over sensitised ears. 

'What do I want?' My aunt replied at last and sighed heavily. 'I don't know what I want,' she added. 'I must be insane...' 

'Aunt Adele...' I began, but stopped when I realised that I had nothing to say. 

I knew that my aunt was in my cabin for a reason, and I could guess what that reason was, but I didn't dare articulate my thoughts in case I was horribly, horribly mistaken. 

'You saw me, didn't you? You saw me this evening... through the door.' 

'Yes,' I croaked, surprising myself when I heard my hoarse voice. I hadn't meant to say anything; it was a completely involuntary reaction. 

'I knew it,' my aunt murmured. There was a long pause and I wondered if I wasn't actually dreaming. 'How much... how much did you see?' 

'I saw,' I started and then paused. 'I saw you on your bed...' 

'Shit,' Aunt Adele whispered, then continued. 'Did you enjoy seeing me? Tell me, I need to know. Did you?' 

'Yes,' I whispered hoarsely again. 'I enjoyed it... You were so... so... beautiful.' 

My aunt's breath hissed through the dark as she sighed heavily. 'Really?' she asked. 'You thought I was beautiful?' 

I sat up in bed; my voice was earnest in my desire to make myself clear. 'Aunt Adele,' I murmured. 'You're beautiful, full stop. I think you're just so damn sexy... Ever since I found...' 

I cut the sentence short. I'd gone too far. I shouldn't have let my mouth run away with me, but I was overcome by events. 

'Found?' My aunt asked, obviously puzzled. 

I had no choice, I had to tell. 'When I went down to get your sunglasses the other morning... Remember?' I sensed rather than saw my aunt's head nod. 'Well,' I continued, 'I found your... your... your vibrator and that book.' I paused and then rushed on blindly. 'I wasn't prying,' I gushed. 'I found them by accident... But ever since then, I've been thinking about you all the time... Then, this afternoon... And that kiss tonight' 

What else could I say? It was all out now. I sat quietly and just let my aunt think before she responded. 

'I knew you'd seen me,' Adele started. 'But, I didn't realise you'd found...' She paused and chuckled. I didn't know if that was a good sign or not, so I remained quiet. 'I knew there was something up with you the other day, but I had no idea...' Adele's hand came to rest on my uncovered midriff in the darkness. 'I didn't realise how you were feeling...' 

The pressure of Adele's hand focussed all my attention. Her fingers were scant inches from my cock, her hand was on the flat of my stomach and I gasped when my aunt leaned in close and kissed me again. 

This time the kiss was urgent, much more overtly passionate than the ones we'd shared quickly in the corridor that night. As my aunt pushed her wet tongue into my mouth, I felt her fingers close around the shockingly quick rush of my stiff cock. 

'Jesus, Russ,' my aunt breathed when the kiss broke. 'You're as hard as iron...' 

I groaned and pulled my aunt to me roughly. The mist of lust was fogging my judgement and I was overcome by an arterial burst of desire and wanting for my sexy aunt. 

Adele squeezed the shaft of my cock and squirmed her tongue around inside my mouth. My own lust flared brightly and I was on the verge of throwing my aunt onto her back on my bed and spearing her sex with my urgent, angry cock. 

Before I could take action, my aunt pulled back quickly. 'No!' she cried. 'This is so wrong... I'm sorry... You're Rebecca's son... my sister's son. What am I thinking of?' 

Aunt Adele,' I called out, but it was already too late. My aunt was off the bed and moving quickly towards the door that joined our cabins. I saw her amorphous shape briefly and then she was gone. The doors clicked loudly and I knew that I was alone again; alone in the dark with my hard cock and tormented thoughts for company. 

My immediate thought was to follow my aunt, but I quickly realised that she wouldn't be in the mood to listen to anything I had to say. Even in the midst of my hormonal turmoil I knew better than to pursue her. She was just as confused and bewildered as I was. She obviously felt something for me, but morality and decency were holding her back. 

I lay in the dark for a time thinking about what had just happened. The residual feeling of her hand on my cock... the feel of her tight grip caused my penis to remain hard and ready for a long time after Adele had done her disappearing act, and I masturbated quickly, desperate to find some respite from the yearning I felt for my mother's sister. It didn't take long and I grunted my pleasure into the dawning light as my semen spurted from me in a hot torrent of temporary release. 

*** The next day was agony. There was a palpable tension between my aunt and me when the family gathered at breakfast. 

'Are you alright?' My mother enquired of her sister after only a few moments of being together. 

'I feel a little ill,' my aunt lied and rushed away from the gathering. 

'Oh dear!' my mother turned to Dad. 'I hope Adele feels okay later; we're ashore tonight.' 

I spent yet another day of the cruise locked in my own thoughts. I might as well have not bothered with the holiday for all it was worth to me. All I could concentrate on was my aunt. I wanted her, badly. Every waking moment was filled with thoughts of my aunt's physical presence. I wanted to run my hands over her soft, bare skin; to feel the gentle sweeping curve of her waist and broad, generous hips. I longed to delight in the pliant texture of her big, swaying bosom as I cupped her jugs in my hands and felt their weight. God, I was becoming obsessed by her. 

I eventually made my way back to the torture chamber that was my cabin and was surprised to see a note on my pillow: 

"Don't go ashore tonight." 

That was all the note said. I felt a surge of joy. Was this from Adele? Of course it was. Who else had access to my cabin other than the ship's stewards perhaps? It had to be her. My heart thudded and my throat dried. It was only an hour and a half before we were due to leave the ship and take a trip into Egypt for the next two days. How could I reasonably get out of this? I couldn't go on the trip now that Adele had made her wanting obvious. I don't know what prompted her or motivated her to leave the note on my pillow, and to be honest I didn't care. My aunt wanted me to stay with her, and the whys and wherefores didn't matter to me. All that mattered was that my aunt had written that note. 

'It must be something you both ate,' my mother said, concerned late that afternoon when I feigned an illness. 'Adele's just the same... it's such a pity... both of you ill, it's just me and your dad then.' 

I lay on my bed, fully clothed and wishing the interminable interval away. It felt as though the time would never come for the tour party to depart, but eventually, inexorably the hands on the clock crept round to the allotted time. 

What now? 

I sat bolt upright when the metallic snick of the connecting door opening alerted me to my aunt's movement. I looked across and saw the wide gap between the doors. 

'Adele?' I called out gently. 'Aunt Adele?' 

There was no response so went to the door and looked into my aunt's cabin. 

'Come in,' I heard her whisper. 'Come to me, please.' 

I walked into my aunt's boudoir and stopped dead. There she was, under the covers, all I could see were the tanned, upper slopes of her breasts and the lovely golden smooth shoulders. I looked into my aunt's bright eyes and took in the image of her pretty face, dyed blonde bobbed hair and her oh-so-kissable mouth. 

'Come here,' my aunt whispered huskily and threw back the duvet. I swallowed hard and felt my penis stiffen savagely when I saw her naked body fully for the first time. 

I moved slowly, mesmerised by my aunt's invitation. Her big tits hung heavily, gravity only just managing to disturb their sweet symmetry. I moaned a, low, keening sound in the back of my throat when I saw my aunt's thick, distended nipples in the hot coral pink of her puckered areola, and my mouth actually watered at their succulence. 

As approached my aunt opened her smooth thighs and showed me the shocking, soft secret between her legs. I swallowed again at the picture of Adele's plump lipped vulva framed between her soft thighs, with the curled folds of her labia peeping almost shyly from the smoothness of her body. 

My aunt laughed when she saw my serious expression and then teased me further my licking the tip of her middle finger and running the digit through her sex. 

'Take your clothes off,' she sighed and swirled her sex under her fingers. 'Come on... Come to me... I want you naked.' 

My aunt sighed heavily and her eyelids closed while she enjoyed the sensation of her fingers against herself. I stripped hurriedly, never taking my eyes from her urgent rubbing. When I was fully nude I went to her, my cock jutting arrogantly from my groin, an obvious sign of my lust for my aunt. 

'Oh my,' she smiled when she saw my thick shaft waggling in front of her. 'Let me taste you, Russ. Please, let me taste your lovely cock.' 

I held my breath as my aunt reached for me again. I half expected her to stop at the last second, and for her to say it was all a mistake and that I shouldn't be there with her as I was. 

My aunt smiled and caressed my aching shaft for a short time. 

'This is so morally reprehensible, so, so bad.' Aunt Adele looked at me and smiled a strangely sad little smile. 'If we cross this bridge, there's no going back,' she whispered and continued to stroke my penis. 'It'll be our secret... our shameful secret...' She sighed and looked at my hard shaft only an inch or two from her face. 'Can you accept that? Can you accept that we're about to do something so terrible that we'd be pariahs in our family?' 

It was as though my aunt was actually relishing the taboo nature of our situation. She appeared to be revelling in the forbidden aspect, and I must admit that her words were having a profound effect upon me. I was aroused like I'd never been before. My cock was throbbing and I felt a deep, carnal lust warm the pit of my stomach. Okay, it was wrong... It would be incest... My own mother's sister, my Aunt, but I wanted her. The Devil could have me tomorrow if I could just have this lovely woman for the night. 

'Well?' Adele asked. 'Can you? Can you take the consequences... can you live with the guilt?' 

I couldn't speak. I felt like I was going to explode, so I just nodded. My aunt stopped her languid stroking and looked at me intently for several seconds, before finally, moving almost imperceptibly, she touched her red lips to the dome of my cock. My breath hissed from me as, at last, my aunt kissed my cock head and then took the bulb of it between her lips. 

'Oh fuck... Aunty...' I groaned when I felt her mouth on me. I looked down and saw my aunt's hollowed cheeks as she sucked at the end of my cock. 

I suddenly realised that I was well on the way to falling for my aunt. I had been thinking of her constantly over the past week or so... ever since my discovery... but now? Now she was sucking my cock like the lover she'd so unexpectedly become and I felt a reciprocal burst of affection for her. 

'I don't care,' my aunt murmured and smeared my leaking glans around her cheeks, leaving a trail of clear goo on her skin. 'I don't care how wrong or how bad this is... I want you. I want you to have me; just for this cruise. Just be my lover for the rest of our time on the ship. It's been an age since I had a man; since I had a man inside me, filling me with cock... Oh, God,' my aunt whimpered. 'I want you to fuck me tonight, baby. Just fuck me... Don't analyse it...' 

Adele slurped hungrily at my cock after her little outburst. She pushed me to the bed impatiently and took me into her mouth. She massaged my balls gently and slobbered her saliva over the dome of me and let the stuff dribble down my shaft until it pooled wetly at the base of my cock. Adele fellated me vigorously and I saw a silver string of goo bridging her lips and my cock when she stopped sucking for a moment. The thread linked us momentarily before the fragile strand broke, and I saw my aunt's pretty features stained with my ooze. 

===

Adele had left a foamy mix of her saliva and my precum around the head of my cock when she came up for air again, but she kept up the pressure by wanking her fist urgently up and down the slippery shaft. 

My aunt groaned and kissed me while keeping up the vigorous manipulation of my shaft. Her gooey tongue pushed into my mouth and coiled sinuously with my own tongue while my Adele groaned and moaned her arousal into my open mouth. 

'Shit, Aunt Adele,' I muttered when the semen flooded from the eye of my cock. 'I'm sorry,' I panted and grunted gutturally as several thick blobs of cum splashed onto my aunt's wobbling breasts. 

'Yes baby, yes!' Adele squealed when she saw my climax gushing from me so forcefully. 'Do it for me... show me the hot stuff.' 

Adele clamped her lips around my cock to catch the final, dying squirts and then smiled at me and swallowed when I'd finally finished. 

'That was so fucking good,' she whispered and kissed me again. 'I'm so turned on... I've wanted you all day. I've been using that dildo and dreaming of you fucking me all afternoon.' She lay beside me on the bed and smoothed her hand over my belly. 'I sent mental messages to you. Willing you to open the doors so you could come and fuck me; but you never came.' My aunt moved from me and opened her legs. 'I wrote that note out of desperation... and now you're here. We're going to be lovers.' Adele spread the soft flaps and showed the hot pink of her sex. 'Lick me there, Russ,' she sighed. 'Lick my cunt.' 

I'd never heard my aunt use such an obscenity before. It shocked in spite of what we'd just done together, but I felt a surge of blossoming lust rush through my veins and my cock twitched with renewed interest. 

I moved between my aunt's thighs and looked right into the slippery wet of her sex. I saw her opening pulse slightly in anticipation of what was to follow, and I lifted the soft hood that hid Aunt Adele's clitty from my gaze. 

'Suck it, baby,' Adele sighed when I sucked her stiff clit between my lips. 'Make Aunty come... Lick her dirty cunt and make her come.' 

My aunt's potty mouth was an incredible turn on for me. I'd never heard her use such a string of obscenity before, but the effect on my cock was inspirational. I slurped and licked at my aunt's hot sex and my erection was swift and breathtakingly ardent as I built myself up towards a frenzy of excitement. Aunt Adele's passion was just as obvious as she drove me onwards vocally to tongue her to a climax. 

As well exhorting me to greater feats of oral endeavour using her voice, my aunt was just as demonstrative physically. She held my head tight and rubbed the slick, slippery-smooth heat of her scarlet cunt over and around my face and tongue. 

I probed at her opening and felt her body open with a squelch as my finger slid into Adele's molten centre. I wriggled my fingers inside her and rubbed the spongy wall searching for the legendary g-spot. The girls I'd fingered and fucked so far in my twenty-four years had alluded to the 'special place' inside them, but so far my search had proven fruitless. 

Whether I found Adele's g-spot or not, I don't know for sure, but she was soon panting heavily and moaning loudly as I carried out a two-pronged assault on her quim and clit. 

My aunt sighed loudly and suddenly relaxed totally; she pushed my face from between her thighs and rolled over onto her front. 

I knelt on the bed and watched my aunt move her deliciously ripe, voluptuous body sinuously until she was knelt on the bed next to me. She had one foot on the carpet and one knee resting on the bed. She took her weight on her outstretched arms, palms down and pushed her hips back at me. The round globes of my aunt's generous derriere were there before me as she so obviously offered herself. 

I looked at Aunt Adele's body and ached for her. Her big breasts hung below her, soft and round and I had a fleeting thought of how I would love to hold those heavy tits in both hands while I stabbed my hard cock into my aunt from behind. 

'Please babe,' my aunt whimpered. 'Please it's time... I want to feel you moving inside me.' She wriggled her lovely peach of a backside and reached around with one hand to pull her buttocks wide. 

The sight of Adele's sphincter and the sticky way her labia peeled apart under the pressure of her grasp spurred me into a flurry of movement. I held my aunt's buttocks wide and spat a gob of saliva onto the dirty stain of her anus. I licked at the most intimate spot and heard my aunt groan deeply with appreciation. 

'You dirty, dirty boy,' she sighed. 'My arse... Oh yes! Wriggle your tongue in my arse...' 

I dabbed at Adele's rectum for a few moments and then rubbed the hard shaft of my cock between her piss flaps. I split the folds with my blunt cock head and finally eased the bulb into my aunt's clenching cunt. 

'Aunt Adele,' I whispered, unable to believe what was happening. 'I'm in... I'm inside you... Shit, you're so hot on my cock... so hot and so wet.' 

'I know, baby,' Adele groaned and flung her head back as I slid deeper into her body. 'I can feel your lovely cock splitting me... Fill me with it... Go on use your cock, fuck me.' 

I felt like I was going to blow my load into my aunt right there and then. I was so aroused, so turned on by the unbelievable notion that I was actually fucking her. Of course the whole situation was spiced by the sheer forbidden aspect of our coupling. My mother's sister! I was having carnal knowledge of my own aunt. 

I had a vivid picture of my mother and my aunt as I'd seen them in family photographs. My mother with her arm draped protectively around her little sister's shoulder... there was ten years difference between my mother and my aunt... If my mum could only see her baby sister now as she knelt on the bed on board ship and took her nephews thick phallus greedily from behind. 

I held my aunt's hips and slowly moved in and out of her. I wanted to imprint this sublime moment indelibly onto my memory. I wanted to savour each slide into the heat of my aunt's molten core. Each soft sigh and moan was music to my ears, and I even loved to hear the soft slap of my tight abdomen slapping gently against Adele's rippling buttocks. 

Then, I began to slowly increase the tempo of my thrusts. My aunt's grunts of appreciation were all the clues I needed as to whether I was putting in a good enough performance or not. I constantly changed the angle and depth of my penetration as well, until I was finally pounding into Adele with vigour. 

I remembered my earlier thought about my aunt's big tits and I reached under her body to finally take those big jugs in my palms. The feel of my aunt's soft, yet somehow pliant flesh bulging under my palms sent a fresh frisson of excitement through me and I knew it wouldn't be long before I came for the second time. 

'Aunty,' I grunted, the reference to our relationship seemed suddenly childish given the circumstances, but it was the force of habit. 'I'm going to come, Aunty,' I murmured and tried to close my mind to the inevitable surge. 

'That's okay, sweet baby,' she sighed. 'Do it in me... It'll bring me off as well... Fill me with your love.' 

My aunt's words sent me over the edge and I spurted my seed deep and hard into her. True to her word Adele cried out in rapture when she felt my cock pulse inside her, and I felt her insides clench and convulse around my shaft in a reciprocal rhythm. 

My aunt quivered and shook as she climaxed until she gave a final, low moan and slumped forwards onto the bed. 

I lay down alongside her, my cock dribbling the remnants of my own glorious orgasm, but I paid no heed to the mess I was making on my aunt's sheets and just cuddled against her soft body. 

The rest of that night was spent alternately dozing, talking and making more sweet love. Sometimes our coupling was savagely intense, with Adele swearing and blaspheming as she urged me on to fuck her harder and harder. Other times I thought I could cry with the beauty and frailty of the feelings budding in my chest. I lay in Adele's arms as the new day broke and wondered if my world would ever be the same again. 

*** Adele and I shared a bed for the rest of the cruise. It was difficult keeping my hands off her during the public hours, but in the privacy of our cabins I delighted in feeling the texture of my aunt's smooth skin as I ran my hands over her body. I adored her voluptuous figure, her big breasts with the permanently stiff, rubbery nipples. I loved to taste her syrup as she came onto my tongue. The noises she made... the language she used... the sight of her lovely, round buttocks... 

Everything about those intimate hours we shared were more than food and drink to me and on the penultimate night of the ship's voyage I finally blurted out the inevitable: 

'I love you, Adele,' I sighed heavily as my cock spurted its seed into my aunt's body yet again. 

It seemed I had a never ending supply of cum and that I was spraying it over or into my aunt with staggering regularity. 

Adele lay quietly, her legs wide and her cunt offered to me as I came. She didn't reply, but was strangely sombre for the remainder of the evening. My immediate thought was that I'd gone too far and that I'd upset her by my outburst. 

On our final night Adele rode me until her orgasm ripped through her. I watched as her beautiful face contorted with the concentration and delight she was experiencing as she rode me. Her breasts bounced and swung as she fucked and Adele used her hands against my chest to steady herself during that wild ride. I could sense that there was something special about this time, and that my aunt was being unusually vigorous as she sought her release. 

'That's the last time, baby,' she murmured as she lay in my arms immediately afterwards. 'We're home tomorrow... No more, it's over.' 

I was devastated. I knew the deal had been that we would commit our sin for the duration of the voyage, but I had shoved that idea to the back of my mind. Here it was however, the parting. 

I didn't sleep at all that night. I just held my aunt close and stared into the darkness. I was lost, I loved her and my life would never be the same. As difficult as it was, it was time to pay the piper. 

*** Two weeks after the cruise I answered the door to my flat after the bell rang one evening. It was late, gone eleven, and I cursed since I was in no mood for visitors. 

Since the cruise I'd had no contact at all with Adele. No phone calls, no emails, no letters... Nothing. I tried to forget the heartache by looking for a job. I had my degree and now it was time to make my way in the world. The trouble was that I didn't really have the stomach for job hunting. Nothing seemed to matter much; the world was drab and colourless as I wallowed in my self pity. 

Of course you can guess who was at my door. It was my aunt. She stood in the foyer and looked at me sheepishly. The sight of her jolted me awake and my heart really did seem to leap in my chest. 

'It's no good,' she said quietly as I stood and stared at her. 'I love you as well...' 

Epilogue: 

My aunt and I spent as much time together as we could under the restrictions of our circumstances. We took risk after risk, and it was inevitable that we'd eventually be found out. The results are too painful to describe, but Adele's predictions about the outcome of any discovery proved correct. 

We are outcasts from the family now. My mother was inconsolable, and I have neither heard from, nor seen her in three years. 

Maybe one day... 

These days I live in Canada, Alberta as it goes, and Adele lives with me. We're far enough away from anyone who knows us so as to be able to live as a couple. We go out together; hold hands, kiss, and do all the usual stuff a married couple do when they're in love. 

We share a bed and our lives. Report_Story
