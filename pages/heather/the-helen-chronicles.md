Foreword: 

A while back I wrote The Dark Trilogy, three stories that reflected my feelings toward my first wife even though she has been out of my life for over thirty years. I received a lot of feedback asking me what in the world she could have done to me to cause that much rage and for me to still feel that strongly thirty years later. 

I thought about it and decided to tell the story, but the story comes with a caveat - they are true, but they may not be 100% true. I do not know that much of what I'm writing actually happened the way that I'm writing it. With the exception of the last episode (The Best Friend) I only know what I've been told. I didn't catch Helen with any of her lovers except for Herb. It was only after catching her with Herb and our subsequent divorce that friends (and some relatives) came forward and told me about the rest. In each case they told me that they thought I knew, that I was one of those guys who got off on having a slut wife. I'm sure that I still don't know all of it, but I do now know of the following: 

- The Dishwasher 

- The Pizza Man 

- The Hamburger Man 

- The Cop 

- The Bar Tender 

- The Drummer 

- The College Boy 

- The Ups Driver 

- The Coca Cola Salesman 

And of course, The Cousin and Best Friend. 

I know of these men, but I have no way of knowing the real story of when, where and how. I am however, based on my knowledge of Helen's likes and dislikes and the circumstances at the time, able to make some fairly reasonable assumptions. So, while my description of what happened with her and the cop might not be accurate the fact that she did the cop is not in dispute. 

I received a lot of information after the fact that has helped me in putting together these scenarios. For instance, after the divorce I dated one of the girls that Helen worked with when she met the cop so I know how it started, how long it lasted and a little of how it ended. Herb's wife told me some of the story of Helen and the drummer and of Helen and the college boy and from others I got bits and pieces about the rest. A talk with Herb's wife Sally is a case in point: 

"Oh come on Rob, how could you not know what she was and what she was doing? I knew the night of the bowling banquet when you decided to go to that tournament in Madison. Christ Rob, she was all over that drummer and I half expected her to do him right there on the dance floor. You had to see it. I know you had to see it and you didn't do anything except let it happen. She had him over every night you were gone and then maybe two or three times a week for another month until she got tired of him. You telling me that you didn't know?" 

I remembered the night. I belonged to the Fraternal Order of Eagles and I bowled in the Eagle's Friday night league. The Eagles had a state bowling tournament and I and another guy had teamed up to compete in the doubles and we had won. At the year end bowling banquet we got our trophy and our prize money. The band was decent and they played a lot of Helen's favorite songs. I was busy talking about bowling and tournaments and Helen had wandered over to where the band was taking their break to make a request and they asked her to join them. During their next break I saw Helen standing with the drummer, but I didn't think anything of it. If I thought anything it was probably that she was requesting another song. 

Later in the evening, Mike, the captain of one of the other teams asked me if I would like to go to the Eagles national tournament being held that year in Madison, Wisconsin. They had already entered, but one of their guys had to drop out and they were looking for someone to take his place. We left the following Friday morning and I didn't get back until Monday morning. 

"And I suppose you are going to tell me you didn't know about Jason?" Sally said. I shook my head no. "He was nailing her a couple of times a week until you moved. I can't believe that you don't know any of this stuff; everybody else knows it." 

I remembered Jason. At the time we were renting the downstairs of a two-story house that had been converted into a two family flat. Jason was an eighteen- year-old college student who lived upstairs with his parents. I never noticed that he spent anytime around Helen, but then I was beginning to learn that there was a whole lot I hadn't noticed. I was beginning to ask myself if I had been really blinded by love or was I just naturally unobservant. 

"How did you know about Jason?" 

"Jason has a big mouth. He was bragging around school about this hot older woman he was banging and he named her. How did I know he wasn't lying? Because he described her, right down to the butterfly tattoo just above her pussy. Knowing what you know about her now you have to know that if he saw that tattoo he had already reached the Promised Land." 

I had to believe it. Helen kept herself shaved except for a six inch long 'landing strip' and just off to the right of the strip and five or so inches up from her cunt was a multicolored butterfly I had given her on her twenty-fifth birthday. 

That information allowed me to build the framework of the story, but the meat of the story is from my imagination. 

I have never known the why. After I caught Helen I asked her why and all I got was an indifferent shrug. So, as you read these stories bear in mind that they actually did happen; maybe not exactly as I've portrayed them, but they did happen.

The Dishwasher and The Pizza Man. 

I met Helen when I went to where my mom worked. Mom's car had broken down and was in the shop and I had stopped by to give her a ride home. There was a new girl working at the restaurant and she was a beauty. I was having a hard time keeping my eyes off of her and my mother noticed. She laughed and said: 

"I guess I'd better introduce you to her otherwise you will be bugging me all the way home with questions about her. I'll introduce you and you can get your information direct. Besides, it will do you both good." 

"How so?" 

"Well, you are back and don't know anybody and she has just moved here and she doesn't know anybody so the two of you have something in common." 

Helen had just moved to Detroit from Bluefield, West Virginia and had only been in town a week. I had only been in town for three weeks. I had joined the Army when I graduated from Ypsilanti High School and had been gone for three years. While I had been doing my sixteen month tour in Korea my mom and dad had moved to Detroit and on my discharge I had joined them there so I knew no one. 

Mom introduced me to Helen and things took off from there. We dated for six months and then I asked her to marry me and she said yes. When I told mom I expected her to be happy for me, but that wasn't the case and in fact, she tried to talk me out of it. 

"You are both too young. You need to meet some other girls and find out what other fish are in the pond. You really don't know much about each other" and a lot more stuff like that. She never did tell me the real reason why she was against the marriage until after the divorce by which time it was way too little, way too late. 

Helen and I got the blood tests and the license and then we called around and found a Justice of the Piece in Redford Township who could fit us in and we drove over there and got married. Unknown to me was the fact that Helen started being unfaithful to me about six weeks before the wedding. 

The Dishwasher. 

Mario was an Italian kid who had dropped out of high school and in those days in Detroit no diploma meant factory work or scut work. The factories weren't hiring so Mario ended up a combination janitor and dishwasher at the restaurant. He set his sights on Helen the first day he came to work and over the next couple of months he did everything he could to try to get close to her. It didn't seem to matter to him that she was twenty-two and he was only eighteen. 

Before long they were taking their coffee breaks together and their lunch breaks together. When she got stuck with closing at night he offered to give her rides home and offered to pick her up and bring her to work. My work schedule prevented me from being able to do those things and so she accepted. Her only other alternative was to ride the DSR and while the buses ran frequently during the day they weren't all that great at one in the morning. 

I wasn't all that happy when she told me about Mario giving her rides, but I could see where standing at a bus stop for a half hour at oh-dark-thirty waiting for the Grand River bus to take her to Fenkell would be less than attractive, especially when a ride was available. 

One night when Mario gave her a ride home she leaned over to give him a 'thank you' kiss on the cheek. He turned his head and took the kiss on his mouth and when Helen didn't jerk her face away from his he slipped her a little tongue. When she still didn't pull back he put his arms around her and pulled her close. They did some pretty heavy necking for a while and then Mario put his hand inside her blouse. At that point she pushed him away, got out of the car and went into the house. 

The next night it was the same except the necking started as soon as Mario pulled up at the curb and lasted much longer and that time he got to play with her tits for a while before she stopped him. By the end of the week he was finger fucking her and she was giving him hand jobs. 

It happened on a Wednesday. It was Mario's day off and Helen was working the three to midnight shift. Around seven-thirty the phone rang and my mother, who was working the noon till nine shift, answered it. The call was for Helen and mom thought she recognized the voice of the caller, but she didn't think anything about it at the time. She went and got Helen and then noticed that Helen seemed to be furtively looking around as if afraid someone might over hear what she was saying. That made mom curious, but the place was packed and she was busy waiting on customers so she had to get back to work. 

Helen's dinner break was at eight-thirty and mom just happened to be in the kitchen as Helen was going out the back door. Again mom thought Helen looked like she was trying to hide something and she went to a window and looked out in time to see Helen climb into Mario's car. Mom knew that Mario wasn't scheduled to work that day and she wondered why he was there and why Helen was getting in the car with him. She saw the car move to the back row of the parking lot and park there. 

Her curiosity now in full force she grabbed her coat and went outside to see what was going on. Staying out of the light she walked to the back of the lot to see what she could see. She cautiously moved up on the right rear quarter and looked in the car to see Helen's head bobbing up and down on Mario's cock. Her uniform top was unbuttoned and her tits had spilled out and Mario was fondling them. After two minutes of watching Helen blow Mario mom saw Mario push Helen away and mom stepped back as the two in the car changed positions. It wasn't until she saw Helen's legs come up that she edged forward to look in the car again. Helen's legs were spread wide and Mario was between them and sliding his cock into her cunt. 

Mom had to get back to work so she turned and left. She was in the kitchen when Helen returned. "Did you go out for lunch?" mom asked. 

"Yeah. I'm tired of eating the same old stuff here. I needed a change" and then the two of them went back to waiting on customers. 

Every night after that Helen took her dinner breaks in Mario's car. On the day we were married I had no idea when I slipped the ring on her finger that less than fourteen hours earlier she had been getting fucked by Mario in his car and I had no clue that it would happen again and again over the next three months and that it would only end when the next player took the stage.

The Pizza Man. 

The restaurant was Italian and their specialty was Scilian Pizza. This was in the days before Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, Domino's and all the other chains. The owner of the place, Salvadore Bellandini, was also known as Stutz and some times called Pizza man. The restaurant was on the corner of Grand River and Dumbarton and on Dumbarton there were several large apartment buildings and it was in one of those apartment buildings that Helen and I began our married life. 

I was working the swing shift at the Ford Motor Company River Rouge complex and since I worked swings Helen stayed on the three to midnight at the restaurant even though she had enough seniority to move to days. 

Since she only had a three minute walk to get home to our apartment she was usually home and in bed when I got there. I say usually because some nights she worked late to help close. She always waited up for me and I usually found her waiting with her legs spread wide and telling me to hurry. I would quickly strip, climb into bed and unknowingly slide my cock into Mario's leftovers. Helen was always wet and she told me that it was because she was always hot and horny from constantly thinking about me and what we would do as soon as I got home from work. 

I didn't know any better. Excluding the paid whores I'd been with in Japan and Korea I'd only been with two girls, both one night stands, so my experience was almost nil. And why would I have wondered about it anyway? We were just married and I was crazy about her and she certainly seemed crazy in love with me and she spoiled me rotten. She fucked me into exhaustion when I got home from work, woke me up with blow jobs and gave me 'nooners' before sending me off to work. I was happy with my life and had no reason to believe there was anything wrong with it. 

Back at the restaurant Stutz became aware of what was going on between Mario and Helen and he decided that he wanted some of Helen's pussy. He wasn't about to share her with an eighteen year old dishwasher so he fired Mario and then called Helen into his office and went straight at it. 

"Does Rob know that Mario is fucking you almost every day?" 

Helen, suddenly alarmed said, "God I hope not." 

Stutz stood up and said as he unzipped his fly and took out his cock, "If you don't want him to find out you will get over here and take care of this" and he pointed at his erection. Helen, being the slut that she was, didn't say a word, just walked over and went to her knees in front of him and took his cock in her mouth. She got him off, swallowed and then he told her to get back to work. Just before she opened the door to leave he said: 

"Just a minute. Two things. One, I fired Mario and I want you to stay away from him from now on and two, I want you back in here when you go on your dinner break." 

She went back to his office on her dinner break and Stutz bent her over his desk and fucked her from behind. 

This is all supposition of course, as I have no way of knowing if this is how it started with Stutz or not. Mario was fired and Helen did start fucking Stutz in his office and I know this because of my mother. Mom had been keeping an eye on Helen since finding her fucking Mario. She took Mario's termination and Helen's suddenly frequent visits to Stutz's office, put two and two together and got four. 

Stutz's office was originally part of the store room. He had put up a stud wall, nailed up some drywall and that is as far as he went with it. The drywall had several holes in it caused by carelessness when the desk, file cabinets, and couch were moved in. 

Mom was pretty sure about what was going on, but her curiosity being what it was she wanted to know for certain. She waited until Helen took one of her dinner breaks and then mom went into the store room and looked into the office through one of the holes in the drywall. Stutz was sitting in his desk chair, pants down around his ankles and Helen was on her knees in front of him and sucking on his cock. 

"That's it baby, suck it, suck my cock. You are such a good little cock sucker." 

Helen's head was bobbing up and down and her mouth was making slurping noises. It went on for several minutes and then Stutz said: 

"I don't want to cum in your mouth this time. Let me up." 

Helen stood up, moved to the front of his desk, took off her panties and then bent forward over the desk. Stutz moved up behind her, lifted her skirt up to her waist and then shoved his cock in her. He fucked her steady for about five minutes while she moaned and begged him to fuck her harder and make her cum and then he told her to get ready: 

"Here it comes baby, her it comes. God but I do like cumming in your tight ass pussy." 

As he was zipping up his pants he said, "Are you staying away from Mario like I told you?" 

"He calls me almost every day and I keep telling him we are through, but he just won't leave me alone." 

"Just you make sure you leave him alone. I have to share you with your husband, but I'm not sharing you with anyone else." 

Helen walked over to him, put her arms around him and gave him a deep kiss. "Not to worry lover, I got no time for young kids when I've got you around." 

"Plan on staying late tonight. My wife is visiting with her mother so I don't have to hurry home and you know what a kick I get sending you home to your hubby freshly fucked." 

"I love giving him sloppy seconds after I've been with you." 

"Have you gotten him to eat you while you are still dripping with my juices?" 

"Not yet baby, but I'm working on it." 

"Be sure you let me know when it happens. My dick gets hard just thinking about it so God only knows what it will do to me if you ever get him to actually do it." 

Mom still worked the noon to nine shift so she never saw Helen and Stutz when Helen stayed late. Helen was a fucking whore, but I will give her a little credit - I liked eating her pussy, but she would never let me eat her on the nights she came home from work late. I never knew why at the time, but then I never really thought about it either. One day mom looked in Helen's locker at work and saw a douche bag hanging from one of the hooks and the feeling was that she used it after her dinner breaks and before she came home. 

I'm not so naive that I don't know that there were still some traces of Mario or Stutz in her after she fucked them, but as far as I know she never brought a full load home and let me go down on her. 

+++++ 

Stutz fucked Helen on the average of five times a week for the next year and again I know this because my mom saw it happening. I can see the question coming: 

"She's your mother! How could she let that happen to you and not do something about it?" 

I asked her the same question five years later after the divorce was final and she finally decided to tell me what a fuck pig Helen was. 

"You were so in love with her that you wouldn't have believed me and it would have just ended up poisoning our relationship. Even if I had called you and said, "Come on down during her dinner break and see what she is doing" you would hold it against me for being the one who destroyed your relationship. And there was always the chance that she would burn the wildness out of her and settle down." 

I thought that was a bunch of horse shit and I told her so and we ended up not talking to each other for almost two years. 

+++++ 

Stutz's affair with Helen came to an end when I changed jobs and we moved. Ford was expanding their Wayne Assembly Plant and I put in for one of the Line Supervisor jobs and got it so we gave up the apartment on Dumbarton and moved to Romulus. We found an apartment on Wayne Road and moved in. 

We were still trying to save money for a house so Helen's first order of business was to find another job. Within a week she found a job as a waitress. Her job screwed up our established routine because it was day shift, eight to four-thirty, and I was still working afternoons. When I say it screwed up our established routine I guess what I really meant was that it screwed up mine. All it meant to Helen was that the Pizza Man was replaced by The Cop.

To be continued...

The Cop. 

About a year after my divorce from Helen was final I was sitting in a crowded restaurant in Ann Arbor having dinner when a voice said, "Hello stranger" and I looked up to see Linda Fenlander. 

"Linda" I said as I stood up and offered her my hand. "How have you been?" 

"Fine Rob, and you?" 

"I've been better and I've been worse, but tonight seems okay so far. What are you up to?" 

"I stopped in for dinner, but the place is full and they say there is a half hour wait so I decided to go elsewhere. I was just leaving when I saw you and I thought I would just come over and say hi." 

"Good thing you did because, as you can see, I have room for you here. Would you join me?" 

She sat down across from me and as she did I remembered the last time I saw her. It had been at her wedding. I glanced at her left hand and saw that her rings were missing. I wondered if she noticed that mine was gone too, but her first question answered that. 

"How's Helen?" 

"No idea, but hopefully she's lying in a ditch somewhere slowly bleeding to death." 

She glanced at my left hand and said, "You two split the blanket?" 

"No. Split means equal shares. It came out more like 80/20 in her favor." 

"You had kids, right?" 

"Three of them." 

"That always makes it worse for the man. Luckily Phil and I didn't have ant children to complicate our split." 

"Sore subject?" 

"Very." 

"Hoping that he is in the ditch across the road from Helen?" 

"No, it wasn't his fault that things didn't work out. Enough of the maudlin, what are you up too?" 

"Still with Ford. Working the day shift at Rawsonville. You?" 

"Waiting tables at the Red Fox Inn." 

The waitress came and Linda ordered. We made small talk until the food came and then we ate and chatted and carefully avoided mentioning either of our ex spouses. 

I had met Linda on the first day I stopped at the restaurant where Helen had gotten her job. I'd had a doctor's appointment that morning for my annual physical and so I had taken a day off from work. The physical came with the instructions that I not have anything but water after seven in the evening. As a result I was pretty hungry when I left the clinic so I decided to stop where Helen worked for lunch. The hostess seated me and Linda showed up to take my order. I asked if Helen was around and was told she was in the back filling the salt and pepper shakers. 

"Could you do me a favor and tell her there is someone here to see her?" 

"And whom shall I say is calling?" 

"Her husband." 

"Hello Helen's husband, I'm Linda" and she offered me her hand. "Call me Rob" I said as I took it and shook it. I gave her my order and she left and several minutes later Helen came out and sat with me. After that it seemed like every time I went into the restaurant I ended up sitting in Linda's section and one day I joked about it. As she took my order I asked: 

"So when are you going to make your move?" 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"Just curious as to when you are going to make your pass at me." 

"What the hell are you talking about?" she said in a tone that indicated she was becoming a little upset. 

I laughed and said, "Every time I come in here I end up in your section so I assumed you are bribing the hostess to put me where you can get at me." 

I saw the tightness go out of her and she said, "Oh hell Rob, you were never supposed to figure it out. I was going to do it today, but now that you've caught on I'm too embarrassed. I'll have to pick another time." 

I remembered that as I sat there dining with her. She was a fine looking woman and on a whim I asked: 

"Are you over Phil yet?" 

"Pretty much. Why do you ask?" 

"If you were over him you might be open for a date." 

"Are you asking?" 

"I guess I am." 

I think I'd like that." 

+++++ 

On our third date Linda invited me in when I took her home. She offered me a drink and we ended up on her couch talking. I was on my second drink when she said: 

"You haven't mentioned it, but I am curious. What happened between you and Helen?" 

"Another man." 

"She run away with him or something like that?" 

"No. I came home early one day and found her in bed with him." 

"Oh poor baby. I know that hurts. That's how Phil and I ended. I can't say that I'm surprised. I warned her that might happen if she kept it up." 

"Kept it up?" 

"Seeing other men." 

"Other men? As in more than one?" 

"Three that I know about and I guess that I was responsible for one of them." 

"You were responsible?" 

"In a way." 

"You know you are going to have to tell me about it now that you brought it up." 

"All right, but first you have to understand that I didn't deliberately set out to do what happened. When Helen started working at the restaurant we clicked. We took an instant liking to each other and by the end of her first week I was asking her to stop and have a drink after work with me. I stopped almost every night, not because I was a boozer, but because of Phil. He got off shift a half hour after I did and I didn't feel like sitting around the restaurant waiting for him so I went down to the Landing Strip and waited there. I had half an hour to kill so I asked Helen to join me. She didn't have to hurry home because you were working swing shift so she stopped with me every night. Phil would show up, we would have one drink and then leave. 

"You knew that Phil was a cop, right?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"About three weeks after Helen started stopping with me Phil showed up one night with Brian. Brian was Phil's partner. Brian and Helen seemed to hit it off and suddenly Brian was showing up every night with Phil. Where before we would have one drink with Phil when he arrived and then the three of us would leave all of a sudden Phil and I would leave and Brian and Helen stayed. 

"Two weeks went by and one Thursday night Brian told us he had it big on the numbers and he was springing for dinner at the Red Fox. We all decided to take one car and then come back later for the others so we all got in Phil's car and headed for the restaurant. Phil and I were in the front seat and Helen and Brian were in the back. We hadn't gone two blocks when I heard the unmistakable sound of a zipper being moved. I looked into the back seat and saw Helen taking Brian's cock out of his fly. She saw me watching and she winked at me and then lowered her head and started sucking Brian off. 

"I just sat there and watched. I couldn't believe that it was happening. It was still daylight outside and there we were driving down Wayne Road while Helen was giving Brian a blow job. Anybody who wanted to could look into the car and see what was going on. It was then that it occurred to me that from the way she was doing it, it probably wasn't the first time. I found out later that night that she had been fucking Brian since the third night he had stopped with Phil. 

We were driving along and we got caught by the light at Ecourse Road and there was a Pabst Blue Ribbon truck waiting there and the driver looked down and saw what Helen was doing and he blew his air horn. Helen looked up and he gave her a 'thumbs up' and Helen smiled at him and blew him a kiss and went back to sucking on Brian. The light changed and we took off. A couple of minutes later I heard Brian say: 

"Here it comes sweetie, let me watch." 

Helen took her mouth off him and held it about three inches away from the head of Brian's cock and she jacked him off until the cum spurted out of his dick and jumped across the three inch space into her mouth and then she lowered her head and finished sucking him dry. The she sat up, wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and winked at me again. 

"Later, at the restaurant, we went to the ladies room together and while there I asked her if she knew he was married and she giggled and said: 

"So what? So am I." 

We polished off two bottles of wine at dinner and then we headed back to the Landing Strip to pick up the other cars. We were just pulling out of the parking lot when I heard the zipper noise again and Helen sucked on Brian all the way back to the Strip. 

"The drinks before dinner and the wine with dinner had us in a good mood and the Strip had a live band on Thursday, Friday and Saturday so we decided to go in. Some drinks and some dancing, a few more drinks and suddenly the four of us were in a room at the Airport Ramada Inn. Brian and Helen were on one bed and Phil and I were on the other. 

"I don't even remember what Phil and I did that night because all of my attention was on Helen. I'd never had sex in the same room with another couple before and I was fascinated by Helen. She was an absolute wanton whore in bed. She sucked Brian hard and then pulled him on top of her and begged him to fuck her hard. He did and she came twice before he did. The she moved into a sixty- nine and got Brian hard again. Once he was hard she got on her knees, told Brian to fuck her in the ass and then she buried her head in a pillow and squealed like a pig as Brian took her butt. She moaned, she cried and she begged and Brian fucked her so hard I was afraid he might have a heart attack. Sweat was rolling off him and he was gasping for breath when he finally gasped out: 

"Here it comes baby, here it comes." 

Helen screamed out, "No damn you, no! Not yet, not yet" but Brian was done. Two blow jobs in the car and two cums in the motel room and he was wiped out. Helen was on the bed moaning and begging Brian to get hard again and finish her off, but it just wasn't going to happen. At that point Phil whispered to me, "Can I?" 

"Can you what?" 

"Can I finish her off?" 

Phil saw I was about to blow up on him and he said, "Come on Lin, you won't do anal and I've always wanted to see what it's like. Since you won't do it this is going to be my only chance." 

"On the other bed Helen was fingering her pussy and moaning, "Please Linda, please. Let him, I need it Linda, I need it bad." 

So I went and got all weak minded and told Phil to go ahead. He moved in behind her and started fucking her butt and the sight of it turned Brian on so much that he started getting hard again. He went and washed off his cock, came back and then he and Phil double teamed her - Brian in her mouth and Phil in her ass and later it was Brian in her pussy and Phil in her ass. 

"That was the only time for the four of us. Helen ran with Brian for another six months and Brian would tell Phil what they had done and Phil would tell me. She did some really outrageous stuff if Brian was to be believed. He said they once got in on going through a car wash and another time she gave him a had job when they were at the movies watching Star Wars. She supposedly sucked him off in the men's bathroom at the Landing Strip and one night he took her into the station and they fucked in one of the holding cells. According to Brian he had to let the desk sergeant have a piece of her in order to pull it off. I don't know if any of that is true, but Brian said it was and after the evening we spent at the Ramada I had no reason to doubt him. Then his wife got suspicious and he broke it off with Helen." 

"You said you know of two others?" 

"About a month after Brian dumped her she took up with a UPS driver named Cliff. She told me he had the personality of a grape and bad breath, but she was hanging on to him because he had a ten inch cock. She stayed with him for about two months and then she broke it off with him and took up with the Coca Cola driver. Those are the only two I know about. I do know that she managed to sneak away from you at my wedding reception long enough to have a quickie with Brian. Right after the wedding I quit the restaurant. I talked to her on the phone after that and we did get together for lunch a couple of times and then we kind of lost touch." 

I sat there looking at Linda without saying anything and she asked, "What are you thinking?" 

"I was remembering that day in the restaurant when I asked you when you were going to make your pass at me." 

"As I recall it I said I'd have to pick another time." 

She started to unbutton her blouse and said, "Is this blatant enough?" 

+++++ 

Linda and I dated for another eight months and we seemed to get along great so one day I asked her if she would like to give marriage another try. 

"No thanks baby. I know me a lot better now than I knew me back before Phil and I got married. I'm not the marrying kind." 

"Why do you say that?" 

"I told you. I know me better now. I'm as big a slut as Helen sweetie, and I won't stick another man with that." 

"What does that mean?" 

"Remember when I asked you what happened to you and Helen and you told me you caught her bed with someone else and I said that was how mine ended too?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"When I said that you assumed, because you are a nice guy, that I had walked in on Phil, but that isn't the way it was. Phil walked in on me and what made it really bad was that it was Brian I was with and Brian was fucking my butt which was something that I had never let Phil do. So no sweetie, I wouldn't like to try marriage again unless I found the right man." 

"And what would the right man have to be like?" 

"He would have to be a swinger and into wife swapping or at the very least a man who would get off on knowing his wife was fucking other men." 

"Well that sure isn't me." 

"I know sweetie and I'm sorry, I really am. I'll play with you for as long as you want, but marriage is out." 

I dated Linda for another two months or so and then we slowly drifted apart. I liked her, I liked her a lot, but I had no room in my life for another slut, not even an honest one.

I found out about the Hamburger Man from the Hamburger Man himself. 

+++++ 

I came home from work one night and found a note on the kitchen table. It told me that Helen had set the clock for nine in the morning and asked me to make sure that she got up. I was curious because she normally got up at seven to go to work. The clock went off at nine and Helen rolled over to snuggle up next to me and I pushed her away. 

"Not today honey, you told me to make sure that you got up." 

She crawled out of bed and headed for the bathroom and I got up and made the coffee. I heard the shower and ten minutes later Helen came into the kitchen. 

"A little late for work aren't you?" 

"No, not today or any other day for that matter." 

"What does that mean?" 

"I got laid off yesterday. I need to get out and start job hunting today." 

I found out later that she hadn't been laid off, she had been fired because two of her boyfriends kept coming into the restaurant and causing trouble. She was warned twice to keep them away from the restaurant and when she didn't they let her go. 

She went out job hunting and two days later she told me she had found a waitress job at a restaurant that specialized in charbroiled hamburgers and steaks. It was day shift until she learned her way around and then she would be moved to swing shift and she would be working weekends with Tuesday and Wednesday for days off. I wasn't happy about her hours, but we were still trying to save for a house so I had to accept it. 

The first month or so that she worked there I would stop in for coffee or maybe a late lunch on my way to work, but every time I went in there Denny was there. Denny was the owner and the cook. Did you ever meet someone and know right away you didn't like them? Just took one look at them and knew? The first time I walked into the restaurant Helen introduced us and as I reached for his hand to shake it I knew I wasn't going to like him. He hadn't yet opened his mouth to say hello and I knew. That feeling never went away so after a bit I stopped going into the restaurant. 

A year and a half went by, we managed to save up enough for a down payment on a house and Helen became pregnant with Mary. She worked right up till her eighth month and Denny told her she could come back whenever she wanted to. She had Mary, went back to work and left again to have Nancy; went back again and then left again when she had Marlene. Why she didn't go back to Denny's after having Marlene I didn't know, at least not until after our divorce. 

One day, about a year after the divorce I was driving by the place and I decided to stop for lunch. I don't know why I stopped, I didn't know anyone there well enough to say hi to except Denny and I didn't care for him. They did have good charbroiled steaks though and I guess I must have been in the mood for one. I ordered the luncheon rib eye special and I was sitting there leafing through that days Detroit Times when Denny slid onto the seat across from me. 

"Been a while" he said and I nodded a yes. "Heard that Helen finally dumped you." 

Not true; I had thrown her ass out, but I just nodded a yes. 

"I could never understand why she stayed with you, but I guess it takes all kinds to make the world go around. I guess she probably stayed with you so she could feel good about sticking it to you." 

I was about to stand up and grab him by the throat and stomp the shit out of him, but something in the back of my brain was telling me to cool it and maybe find out some things. God knows he seemed to want to talk. I just sat there and stared at him as he went on. 

"I think she probably got a good kick out of going home to you after being fucked senseless by me and my friends." 

I raised an eyebrow over that and he laughed. "You never knew that did you? No, I guess you didn't, but it's true. In your house, on your bed, on the couch in my office or a motel room, it didn't matter to her as long as she was getting some dick. What was it, five years? No, more like five and a half and you were getting my leavings from the second week she started working here. Mine and those of a half dozen of my friends." 

I just sat there and stared at him. And he sneered at me. "Not much of a man are you? You just sit there while I tell you that I fucked your wife for over five years. A real man would get a little pissed, but you aren't a real man. A real man wouldn't beat on his wife so much that she cheats on him to get back at him." 

"The only reason I'm sitting here is that I don't believe a fucking word of it." 

"Oh no?" he said as he got up. "Don't go away, I'll be right back." 

He was back in three minutes and he slid videotape across the table to me. "Watch that and then call me a liar. 

I looked at the tape for several seconds and then I put it in my briefcase. I leaned across the table and got right in his face. "In the first case sperm breath, Helen didn't dump me. I caught her fucking my cousin and I threw her ass out onto the street. Think about this asswipe; if you spent as much time naked with Helen as you say you did you must have seen all the marks and bruises that my so-called beatings left on her body. You did see them, right?" 

I saw a look come over his face that I didn't recognize, but if I had to guess I would say that it was a "Oops, I just fucked up" look. "Know this hamburger man, I didn't know about you when I came in here, but I know about you now and for you that is not a good thing. My hands are not around your throat right now because it is daylight and there are too many witnesses. I've been to jail once because of the bitch and I have no intention of going again. But hear this asshole. I will catch you some night when you are alone and there are no witnesses around and we will just see how much of a man I am." 

I stood up and said, "You can have the steak I ordered; I don't trust you not to have spit on it. I'll see you around and you can bank on it." 

I'm not stupid and I knew that Denny would do something that would make sure everyone knew that if he showed up badly beaten and with broken bones that it would have been me. I had no intention of going after him; it was enough for me that on dark nights he would always be looking over his shoulder. 

Nine months later his restaurant burned to the ground under mysterious circumstances and I'll say no more on that except that I understand he had major problems in trying to convince the police that he didn't commit arson to collect the insurance money. I heard that the insurance company never did settle with him. 

+++++ 

When I got home from work that night I popped the tape I'd gotten from Denny into the VCR, hit PLAY and found out just how big a whore my ex really was. It started out with Helen walking into Denny's office and talking with him for a few minutes and then she stripped while standing in front of him. Naked, she walked around behind the desk and went to her knees in front of him, unzipped him, took out his cock and started sucking on him. After about three minutes of oral she stood up and moved to the couch against the wall. She lay down, spread her legs and began finger fucking herself while she watched Denny undress. When he was naked he walked over to her and she stopped finger fucking herself and waited with open arms while he moved between her legs. 

I watched as she took his cock in her right hand and guided it into her cunt. For the next four or five minutes Denny fucked my wife while her hands clutched at him, her nails dug into his back and her legs flailed around. He came in her, pulled away and sat down on his desk chair. Helen ran her fingers through her pussy and then brought them up to her mouth and licked them. She then got up, moved over to him and went to her knees and started trying to get him up again. When he was stiff she got on her hands and knees and he took her from behind. After five minutes of hard fucking he came again, the two of them got dressed and left the office. 

The next scene had Helen walking into the office, lifting her skirt and then taking off her panties and throwing them onto Denny's desk. A minute later Denny came into the office, unzipped and took out his cock and Helen turned and bent forward over the desk and Denny walked up behind her and shove himself into her cunt. He fucked her for about five minutes and then he stepped back from her and she turned and went to her knees in front of him and swallowed his cock. She sucked on him until he shot down her throat and a little later he stepped back from her and his limp cock fell out of her mouth. She smiled up at him and made a show of licking her lips and then she stood up, put on her panties and left the room while Denny went back behind the desk and sat down. 

The third scene was another fuck session on the couch and the fourth opened with Denny and another man sitting on the couch. The door opened and Helen came in, locked the door behind her and then undressed. She went over to the couch, knelt down and unzipped Denny, took out his cock and then took it in her mouth and sucked on it for a minute. Then she turned to the man sitting next to Denny and did the same to him. Then she alternated between the two men for about five minutes sucking each one for about a minute before moving to the other. Then she stood up, both men got up and undressed and when they were naked Denny sat down on one end of the couch. Helen got on the couch on her hands and knees and began sucking Denny's cock while the other man moved behind her and pushed his cock into her. After that it was just footage of the two men taking turns on her mouth and cunt until they were done with her. 

There were two more scenes of Denny and another man taking turns on her and then came the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. It started out with three men sitting naked on the couch while a naked Helen, on her knees in front of them, moved from cock to cock with her mouth. After several minutes of that the three men began taking turns on her. She always had a cock in her mouth and one in her cunt until one man decided he wanted to shove his cock in her ass. Helen didn't seem to care for that idea, but three men didn't seem to care about what she wanted and two of them held her while the third rammed his cock into her ass. It did my heart good to see the agony on her face. The only thing that would have made it better for me was if I could have heard her scream. 

The man fucking her pounded her ass hard until he came and then he pulled out of her, walked around in front of her and pushed his slime covered cock in her face. She tried to turn her head and the man grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her head back to his cock. He pinched her nose and when she opened her mouth to breathe he shoved his shit covered cock into the open hole. I yelled "YES!!!!" as I watched him hold her head in both hands to keep her from pulling away. 

While that was happening Denny got behind her and shoved his cock in her ass. He came and moved to her mouth while the third man rammed her ass. Each man took her shit chute one more time and each time Helen had to clean the cock with her mouth. Like I said, it was probably the most disgusting thing I had ever seen, but God, seeing it did me a world of good. The scene ended as Denny was slamming his cock into her ass for the third time while tears ran down her cheeks. 

That last scene led me to the last of Helen's lovers that I would know about. One of the three men who took her ass was The Bartender.

Author's note: 

At the time all this took place VCRs and video cameras were still a figment of someone's imagination. What Denny actually slid across the table to me was a canister containing a reel of regular 8mm film. Suspecting that a lot of readers might not have a clue as to what regular 8 and Super 8mm film might be I used artistic license and substituted a medium they could understand. The reason I couldn't hear Helen's scream was the 8mm film cameras didn't not pick up sound like video cameras do. 

I can only guess at the reason for the Hamburger Man to have the film. Since the event took place ages before sexual harassment became common place I doubt that it was meant to cover Denny's ass in case one of his waitresses complained. I can only conclude that he used it for his own personal amusement or the amusement of his friends.

The Cousin/Best Friend 

I know it is the clich‚ of all cliches, but it became a clich‚ because it happens so often. I came home from work early one night and found out the truth about the woman I had married. I normally didn't get home from work until one in the morning, but on that particular night I had cut my arm pretty bad while trying to solve a problem with one of the stamping machines. I had gone to the clinic and they put four stitches in my arm, gave me some pain pills and told me to go home. 

It was ten after eight when I got to the house and pulled into the drive. I saw my cousin Herb's car parked out front on the street, but I didn't think anything of it. Besides being my cousin Herb was also my best friend and had been since we were ten. Herb was always at the house. He and Helen liked each other and got along well and I knew that on a lot of nights when he didn't have a date or was at loose ends he would drop by the house and keep Helen and the girls company. 

He played games with the girls and after they were packed off to bed he and Helen would play cribbage or gin until I came home. Thinking of the girls made me smile. I usually didn't get to put them to bed except on weekends and sitting with them and reading their favorite stories to them until they fell asleep was to me one of life's little pleasures. 

I walked into the house and found all three girls sitting in front of the TV set. Mary was the first one to see me and she jumped up off the couch and ran to me. "Daddy, daddy, you're home." Normally I would have picked her up and swung her around, but with four stitches in the arm I didn't think that would be a good thing so I set her down and gave her a hug with my good arm. By then the other two had noticed me and came running over. After a minute of hugs and kisses I asked: 

"Where's your mom and Uncle Herb?" 

"In the back playing." 

I took that to mean they were in the kitchen playing cards. I let the girls go back to the TV and I headed for the back of the house where the kitchen was. When I got there I found it was empty and that left me a little confused. The house was a single story and didn't have a basement or a garage and I'd walked through the dining room on my way to the kitchen so all that was left were the three bedrooms. Why in the hell would Helen and Herb be there? I went back into the dining room and turned left to go down the hall that led to the bedrooms and I noticed that the doors to the girl's bedrooms were open and the door to my bedroom was closed. 

It still hadn't occurred to me to think bad thoughts, why would it? My loving wife and my best friend Herb? Why would I think bad thoughts about them? I checked both of the girl's bedrooms and no one was so I went to my bedroom. My hand was on the doorknob when I heard the faint, "Oh god yes, fuck me." I leaned forward and put my ear against the door and heard, "Harder damn it, fuck me harder." 

I might have been a loving and trusting husband up to that point, but I wasn't a stupid one and I wasn't going to go into denial and try to tell myself that it was something other than what it seemed to be and that there was a perfectly logical explanation for what I'd just heard. My heart suddenly went cold as an iceberg and I stepped back from the door. I was going to kick the damn thing in and then I was going to go in there and do some hurting. My rage was overcome by a small voice in the back of my head that was saying: 

"Your girls, don't upset the girls" and that cut through the rage like a sharp knife and I turned and went back to the living room. I told the girls it was bedtime and Marlene (age 3) and Nancy (4) got off the couch and I walked them to their room. Mary, being the oldest at five, a fact that she never let the other two forget, had her own bedroom and also had the privilege of staying up until the other two were put to bed. 

I tucked the two girls in and then read to them until they started nodding off and then I went and got Mary. As I tucked her in I asked: 

"Do mom and Herb play a lot?" 

"All the time. Whenever he is here." 

"Is he here a lot?" 

"Almost every night." 

I read to her until she fell asleep and then I went back to my bedroom and put my ear to the door. They were still at it. "Yes baby, oh yes, hard, just like that, hard." 

I went out to the kitchen, got myself a beer and sat down to nurse it. I wanted to give the girls plenty of time to fall asleep before I went after Herb and Helen. I finished the beer and got up to get another, but before I got to the fridge I was grabbed by what I can only call morbid curiosity. I moved down the hall and put my ear against the door again. 

"Jesus Helen, you have a fantastic mouth on you. That's it baby, suck it, get it hard." 

For some strange reason that even now, thirty years later, I don't understand that pissed me off more than the fact they were fucking. As I listened to what was going on in what used to be my bedroom I wondered what I had done wrong to cause this to happen. At that point in time I knew nothing of what else had been going on over the past seven years and I thought the thing with Herb was the first time. I wracked my brain trying to think of what I could possibly have done to cause her to do what she was doing and I wondered what I could do - what it would take - to make things right between us. 

I stood there in the hallway outside my bedroom door and was actually working on taking the blame before a voice in the back of my head snarled, "Dipshit!" at me and brought me back to reality. The reality was that Helen was fucking another man and it didn't matter if she was doing it because I did something to piss her off. It was still wrong! And that she was doing it with our children just down the hall was unforgivable. 

I went to the coat closet just inside the front door and got the Kodak camera off the shelf, made sure it had film in it and then I went back to the bedroom and kicked in the door. I stepped into the room and started clicking the shutter button. When the kicked open door slammed into the wall Helen looked over, saw me, and then she screamed. 

Herb was concentrating on getting his nut and by the time Helen's scream registered I was at the bed and he turned his face to me just in time for my fist to smash into his nose. Blood spurted everywhere as I dropped the camera and used both hands to pull him off Helen and off the bed. I hit him half a dozen times, driving him backwards and then he stumbled and fell against the bedroom window, which shattered, and he fell backwards through it and landed on the ground outside. 

I walked to the window and looked out at him lying naked on the ground. He was cut and bleeding from the broken glass and the blood still coming out his smashed nose. I looked down and snarled at him: 

"Get up and start running you bastard because I'm coming after you and I'm going to kill you." 

He got up and ran for his car and I saw him stop and fumble under the rear bumper where he apparently had a spare key in a magnetic box. He got in the car and roared off and I turned back to Helen. She had gotten over the shock and she was holding the sheet to cover her and she was looking at me defiantly and waiting to see what I was going to do. 

But I didn't have any idea what to do. Hell, I loved her and what I had just found had torn my guts out. I wanted to know why she had done this to us. I was already going into denial, trying to bury it, trying to find a way to get by it, get us back on the rails, put us back together as a happy family. But I had to know why. 

"Why did you do it?" I asked. "How could you do it with my children wide awake and in the next room?" 

She got a smirk on her face and practically spit at me: 

"Just what makes you think that they are yours." 

It took her all of three seconds to say that, three seconds in which everything changed. Those nine words tripped a switch in my head. 

"You bitch!" I yelled at her. "You fucking whore!" I grabbed her arm and jerked her off the bed, drug her through the house to the front door and threw her naked out onto the front lawn. 

After that things went to hell in a hurry. Helen was screaming and beating on the door demanding that I let her back in. The neighbors called the cops. The cops showed up and told me to let her in the house and I refused and the next thing I know I'm in a jail cell. By the time I got out Helen had taken the girls and split. It took me three months to find them and when I did she had a restraining order against me. 

During those three months Herb filed a complaint against me for assault and battery and sued me for his medical bills. I beat the assault and battery charge because of a sympathetic jury, but I was still out the money I had to spend to defend myself. A month later I ran into him again and I put him in the hospital and warned him to stay out of my life. 

"Keep fucking with me and I'll kill you next time." 

He must have believed me because he wouldn't tell the cops who had put him in the hospital even though I'm sure they knew. 

I sued Helen for divorce on grounds of adultery and she counter sued claiming mental and physical cruelty. It was a bitter divorce and even though I had pictures of her with Herb and my own girls told the court that Herb was there every night and he and mommy went into the back room and played while they watched TV Helen made out like a bandit. In Michigan at that time, and still for all I know, the courts and the Friend of he Court division are predisposed toward the woman no matter what. She got custody of the girls, even thought she plainly unfit to raise them. She got child support and separate maintenance and she had wanted the house, but the courts told us that we had to sell it and split the proceeds. Big deal! Out of my half I had to pay both lawyers and court costs. I would have been better off if I had killed her and thrown myself on the mercy of a jury and knowing what I know now if I could go back in time and relive that night I would have put her in her grave. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It has been over thirty years now and the hate is still there and as strong as ever. The girls have spent years trying to get me to at least talk with her and heal the riff enough that the two of us can attend family events and be civil to one another, but even though Helen is willing I wont do it - ever! The only thing I have promised them is that if I outlive Helen I will take the time and go to the expense of getting to where she is buried so I can piss on her grave. 

Did I ever test the girls to see if they were mine? No! I had been there when they were delivered, I had changed their diapers, fed and burped them, tucked them in bed and read them stories and done the thousand other things that parents do for their children. They were MINE and that was that.

The Bartender 

The last of Helen's lovers that I know about for sure was Richard Barton. Rich was the first of the three men I saw on film to shove his shit covered cock into Helen's mouth and make her clean it off. That act alone kept me from hurting him too bad when I went to pay him a call. 

+++++ 

After Helen gave birth to Marlene she did not go back to work for the Hamburger Man. She was a stay at home mom for about six months and then one afternoon the doorbell rang and I answered it and found a young girl standing there. 

"Can I help you?" 

"Does Helen live here?" 

"Yes, there is a Helen living here." 

"Oh good," she said as she pushed past me and entered the house. "Where is she?" 

"Who are you and what do you want?" 

Just then Helen called from the kitchen, "Who is it honey?" and the girl headed for thew sound of Helen's voice. Helen's sister Edith had arrived. 

With Edith's arrival and her moving into Mary's room we suddenly had a built in baby sitter and I woke up one morning and found Helen dressed and ready to go out. 

"Where are you going that you have to get dressed up like that?" 

"I start my new job today." 

"New job?" 

"Now that Edith is here and can watch the kids I'm going back to work." 

"Dressed like that? You'll get those clothes ruined at Denny's." 

"I'm not going back there. I got a job at Murphey's Bar. I'll be working noon to eight" and off she went. 

+++++ 

Murphey's Bar and Grill served pretty damned good half pound ground round burgers and I started stopping in there a couple of times a week to have lunch before going to work. I met the owners, Rich and his wife Amy, and they seemed like decent folks and the atmosphere at Murphey's was warm and friendly. 

A year went by and then came the day I caught her with Herb and tossed her ass out. Helen kept working at the bar and of course I stopped going in the place. Until I saw the film that the Hamburger Man had taken and recognized Richard. The first thing that entered my mind was, "You fucking cocksucker" and the next was a confused, "What the fuck?" Why had Helen not gone back to work for Denny and instead gone to work for the man who had forced his cock into her ass and then made her suck his filthy cock clean? 

Every time I thought of those shit covered cocks being forced into her mouth I had to smile, but the more I thought about it the more curious I became. It just did not make sense to me. From what I saw she enjoyed fucking the Hamburger Man and she went back to him after having Mary and Nancy and yet, even though she obviously had not enjoyed what Rich had done to her she went to work for him. 

I probably could have gone back to talk with Denny, squeezed his head like a pimple, and gotten some answers from him, but I was afraid I might get a little carried away and I wasn't interested in any more jail time. I couldn't ask Helen because I wanted to kill the bitch so I didn't dare get too close to her so that left Richard. 

I was not at all happy with Richard. I knew Richard. I didn't know Brian, although I did vaguely remember him from Linda's wedding and I didn't really know Phil even though Helen had had him and Linda over to the house for dinner a couple of times. I knew Denny of course, but not well since I didn't like him and had avoided him, but I knew Richard. 

Every time I went into the bar Richard would join me, buy me a beer, talk sports with me, shoot some pool with me and all the time he was being buddy, buddy with me he was fucking my wife. He had to pay for that. Not for fucking my wife, but for smiling at me while he was doing it, for pretending to be my buddy while doing it. 

One night as he came out the back door of his bar he walked into my fist - about four times - and when his head cleared he found himself inside the camper on the back of my pick up truck watching me clean my finger nails with a very large hunting knife. 

"Talk to me Richard. Convince me I shouldn't do bad things to you for fucking my wife." 

"I don't know what you are talking about." 

"Yes you do Richard. I've seen the film that Denny took of you fucking Helen in her ass and then making her lick your dirty cock clean. I would suggest you stop with the protestations of innocence. If you would like to leave here undamaged you are going to have to bring me up to speed on a few things. I want to know why she didn't go back to work for Denny and I want to know when you started fucking her. I also want to know why she came to work for you after what you did to her. Not hard questions Rich; you should be able to ace the quiz." 

He sat across the table from me and I saw the gears turning in his head. I was six foot, two hundred and ten and he was five nine, maybe a hundred and seventy-five. I was between him and the door and I had a very wicked looking knife in my hand. The blood from his nose was all over the front of his shirt and I had no doubt that Helen had told him about what I'd done to Herb. He added it all up, took a deep breath and started talking. 

He first fucked Helen one night when he had stopped at Denny's for a steak. Denny was a good friend of his and Denny told him that he had a hot new girl who loved to fuck and asked him if he would like a taste and Rich had said yes. He fucked her in Denny's office and over the next two weeks he had fucked her several times again. 

"She said she was doing it to get even with you for mistreating her." 

"Mistreating her? How?" 

"She said you were always beating on her." 

"Did you ever see any marks or bruises on her?" 

"I didn't pay any attention. Why would I care what you did to her? She was pussy and she was willing and that's all I cared about." 

One night, about a week after he'd last fucked her in Denny's office Denny brought her to a poker game that Rich was holding in the basement of the bar. She stood around and watched and after about an hour Rich threw his hand in and told the other guys he was going to sit out a few hands. He saw Helen standing there looking bored and so he took her by the hand, led her over to a table on the other side of the room, pushed her back on it and fucked her. When he finished one of the other players was standing there with his cock out and Rich had stepped out of the way. Helen didn't protest when the second man pushed his cock into her and after that all of the seven players had taken a turn. 

After that Helen would get ganged every couple of weeks or so when Rich had a poker game. One night she let eleven men use her. She even did a nine man gangbang when she was in her seventh month of pregnancy with Marlene. The only thing she wouldn't do was have anal sex or fuck a black man. 

"You say she wouldn't do anal, but I watched you, Denny and some other guy fuck her repeatedly in her ass." 

"True, but not because she wanted to. Denny caught her taking money from the register. I guess she had one it before, but had always put the money back. That time Denny had caught her and it pissed him off. He decided to punish her and we cut cards to see who would go first. I was high with a jack." 

"Why didn't she go back to Denny's when she went back to work?" 

"He wouldn't have her. Before she left to have the kid she told him that he was the father and she wanted him to pay her child support. He told her she was full of shit and that the kid could be anyone's; that she'd had so much dick in her that she couldn't have a clue as to who the father was. She had planned to work two more weeks before leaving to have the baby, but Denny fired her and told her not to try and come back after the kid was born." 

"So why did she go to work for you? After the night you did her ass I would have thought she would have nothing to do with you." 

"Hey, who knows with broads. Maybe it was a case of the devil you know versus the devil you don't. Maybe it was because of the poker games. I don't know. Like I said, she was pussy, I like to fuck and she was willing so when she asked me for a job I gave her one. She is a damned good waitress, she brings a lot of guys in who spend a lot of money while they try and hustle her and she takes good care of my friends when I have poker games so why wouldn't I hire her?" 

"And the buddy, buddy shit I used to get when I came in her for a beer or a burger?" 

"You seemed like a nice enough guy and I liked you. Had nothing to do with your wife. Shit man, as big a whore as she was I thought you probably knew what she was doing. In fact, a couple of times Amy was thinking of hitting on you." 

"Amy knows about it?" 

"Hell, she's down in the basement right now lying on the table next to Helen and taking care of some friends. We have what I guess you can call an arrangement. We do what we want as long as we don't keep secrets from each other. Kind of like what I thought you might have going with Helen. Believe me, I was surprised as hell when you kicked her out." 

I shook my head at that. What the hell was it about me that made people think that I was the kind of guy who would let his wife run around, be a whore, and live with it? 

I put the knife away and told Rich to get out of the camper and when he was gone I cleaned up the blood from where it had dripped off of him and then I started up the truck and drove off to get on with the rest of my life. Report_Story
