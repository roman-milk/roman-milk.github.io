"Apart from that she wouldn't wear stockings and suspenders." Jim complained to Angus, a colleague in the office. It was one of a list of criticisms he voiced in complaint since she had phoned telling him she was leaving. The trip to the sub office was going well and Jim would soon be returning home, only to an empty apartment, which he wasn't looking forward to. 

Angus had patiently half listened to the moaning while they worked. With a smile on his face he told Jim. "My wife wears what ever I want her to. Last year she went to a hypnotist to help give up smoking. To save him hypnotising her from scratch each session he used a phrase to put her into a hypnotic state. He calls it a password. I found it out and have been using it to add my own instructions." Feeling he had revealed too much of a personal, perhaps even sordid, tale he shut up to concentrate on preparing the report for Jim. 

Jim felt the embarrassment creep upon them both. He didn't now the man well only arriving from head office a few days ago, yet they seemed to be getting on, but it occurred to him this might be a set-up. "Well it must be a disappointment that she wears them only under hypnosis, isn't it?" Jim asked, trying to sound casual. He might as well see where this was going and with a little encouragement Angus continued. 

"It was, but I worked out something. I suggested she was itchy wearing tights and shouldn't wear them. After that worked I suggested she felt uncomfortable not wearing anything on her legs, so obviously, she started to wear stockings - those stay up ones, you know with elasticised tops. I suggested they might fall down leaving her embarrassed in a supermarket. To avoid the embarrassment she should hold them up with suspenders. After sometime repeating it all, she's now taken to wearing stockings and suspenders all the time." He boasted. 

"That sounds very convenient, having a wife who panders to your whims. Well worth the trouble I'd say. Do you have more plans for her?" Looking a little sheepish Angus changed the direction of the conversation back to the company accounts. 

"What you were telling me this morning sounds intriguing. Perhaps you could give me some hints for my next girlfriend. So I could get her to give in to some little whim or other." With a little encouragement Angus was soon sharing his experience and explained the mistake made in directing her too directly toward what he wanted to achieve. 

"It's not so easy. You can't just tell her to do something she wouldn't normally do. You would have to build up to it with lots of little commands. It's tricky." They fell into silence for a while thinking their own private thoughts. 

"What's the first step? How do I get her hypnotised to start it all off?" Jim asked. Angus was enthusiastic with the chance to share this new found game with someone so wrote down the number of the hypnotist. 

"What if the next girlfriend doesn't smoke? How could I get her to go?" 

Angus thought about this seriously although Jim was still sceptical about the whole idea so it didn't matter that much - he just played along. He merely wanted to find out what Angus had been up to since he was so enthusiastic about it. 

"You could tell her someone at work had lost weight through hypnosis, pretend to get the number from one of the girls in the office. After all women always want to improve their figure. That's something I'm working on with Melody." 

It was true Jane had always been on some diet; it was something he disliked about her, all those fad diets spoiling an evening out at a restaurant. He had to join her eating only carbohydrates or not eating them, avoiding fat as though it were a demon or subsisting on vegetables. "You could be on to something there Angus." He said. 

Seeing Jim was taking it seriously he decided to make him an offer. "You could come round on Friday evening if you like and I'll show you how it's done." Angus offered. 

Before Angus could take back the suggestion Jim agreed. "That would be great. Perhaps you could help with me out with the next girlfriend." He laughed, although this was an empty statement as there was no way he could possibly let Angus near a girlfriend of his. Not wishing to return home this seemed like an amusing diversion to what would have been a lonely weekend. 

Next day was Friday and the end of the day had arrived after many conversations, which intrigued Jim to distraction. He was looking forward to this demonstration that Angus was just as eagerly planning. 

*** 

Walking in to the house the first impression was of an ordinary, neat and tidy home, with nothing out of place. When Melody walked into the lounge it was she that looked out of place, significantly. In the conservatively fashioned home there stood a dream of womanhood that any man would lust over. Angus was around forty yet this woman looked a young thirty something. Long dark hair flowed over bare shoulders and under the fringe were long eyelashes, a pretty little nose and wide full lips. 

What struck him most were the clothes. It was a French maids outfit, low cut with a very short hem. "Take his coat then bring us drinks." Angus ordered, without a please or thank you which would have earned any husband a rebuke before a guest or not. So perhaps Angus had achieved all that he had boasted about. 

With his coat neatly folded over her arm Melody asked, "What would you like to drink, sir." 

Still in a state of shock he moved his attention from the deep cleavage, struggling for an answer. "A beer please." He stammered. He was sure she gave a slight curtsey before disappearing with the coat. 

"So what do you think? It's worth a little trouble setting things up to achieve such a co-operative wife. Don't you think?" Angus asked. 

Jim noticed the gleam in his eye as though he were showing off a new sports car. "It's a great idea Angus." He said, while his mind spun around full of ideas of his own. "That's amazing. She doesn't behave as though she were in a trance yet I can see what you have achieved and I'm impressed." For the first time since their conversations he seriously thought of trying it out on a girlfriend. 

When she walked back into the lounge with drinks their conversation stopped with Jim in mid sentence too embarrassed to continue. 

"Here are your drinks gentlemen. For you, Sir, a beer. For you, Sir, a martini." 

With a closer look he noticed the waist of the dress was pinched in tight giving her a devastating figure, exaggerating the breasts as well as exaggerating a pair of long legs. "There must be a damn tight corset under there." He thought. When she bent over him it looked as though the huge breasts were about to swing forward right out of the dress into his face. He was excited, intrigued and embarrassed all at the same time. His wife was in the room while Angus continued to discuss her though Jim felt unable to join in the conversation being too self-conscious. 

"Let me see those suspenders. That's right lift the dress up. Higher." Angus ordered. Without the slightest hesitation at all she lifted the hem with both hands, showing them both a pair of tight black suspenders over pale white thighs, holding up a pair of sheer stockings. 

Her legs were long and shapely he thought, but it was the glimpse of black panties that really caught his eye, which he tried to ignore out of a sense of decorum before Angus. At twenty-six Jim was the youngest area account manager, confident in the job, yet here he knew he was out of his depth feeling unsure of how to behave in this unusual situation. 

*** 

As she served another round of drinks the phone rang. Jim was concentrating his attention on her movements around the room so missed the beginning of the conversation. 

"I'll have to go. My mother is ill. I'm sorry about this. Damn. It's going to take too long to bring her round and I wanted to keep her like this for the whole weekend. It's an experiment, as I usually keep her under for only a couple of hours at a time. Look I won't be long, could you look after her for me until I get back." Angus asked. 

Jim was a little overawed by the prospect of being left with the woman. She was no longer this man's wife but an overpowering image of a sexy maid, not a real person at all. He nodded absently. 

While hurriedly donning his coat Angus added instructions as he thought of them. "If someone comes round send her upstairs out of the way and tell them I'll be back soon. Best not let them in if you can help it." 

Jim nodded at each of the instructions feeling he should say something yet unable to make his mouth work, even when he managed to think of something to say. The circumstances were so overwhelming it left him tongue-tied. The door finally closed on his newfound friend and confidant. He felt strangely alone as though he were there with a mannequin. 

Melody was busy refreshing the snacks emptying peanuts into a bowl and checking the glasses. Hearing her husband say he had to leave pitched her stomach into turmoil. She felt like shouting at him to stop, yet carried on as ordered acting as the maid. With an outward appearance of disinterest over what her master did she sashayed back to the kitchen for another beer. Inside hot fury welled up where she wanted to shout at him, "What the hell do you think you are doing leaving me with this young man." Yet she couldn't say a word of protest. 

It was bad enough he had introduced a stranger into their home, leaving him here was an outrage. Melody had tolerated Angus' little games knowing it would please him and relieve her of making an effort. This was just too much to tolerate. 

After another drink had been politely delivered and only five minutes had passed he asked her rather timidly, "Would you do anything I ordered?" 

To the hesitant question came an immediate and brief answer. "No." The answer was impassive not what should have been an imperious rebuff. 

From somewhere inside his head came the question. "Why?" 

A moment's hesitation brought forth an explanation. "You have not given me the password." She said, again in a matter of fact way as though discussing the weather. It was only a slight relief to say this for she still felt humiliated to be serving this young man in her own home dressed like a tart. 

After asking some innocuous questions, something occurred to him, so he asked, "You have brought me drinks and are talking to me, though I haven't given you a password. How so?" 

She told him, "My master has ordered me to bring you food and drinks as you want. I have been ordered to speak normally in the house in case someone visits unexpectedly. It is a general command to talk to anyone normally just in case our game is interrupted." She said then abruptly turned on a high heel making her way back to the kitchen. 

"Well at least you haven't been ordered not to answer questions." He thought. He held his breath in anticipation of the next answer. Careful not to make it an order he asked, "What is the password." Jim watched intently expecting there had been a command to block the answer to this vital question. Seeing the hesitation confirmed this was so. 

Melody wavered in fear seeking a way to avoid the answer, and then replied, "No smoking in the gallery." On hearing herself betrayed by her own lips the anger melted leaving fear. A moment ago she had been protected from direct orders only to be left so very vulnerable to embarrassment, or worse. She was sure there were limits to how far he could push her but small little naughty things could be so dreadfully humiliating. 

Hesitantly he repeated the password. 

The reply was involuntary yet immediate after so long practising the game, "I am awaiting your order, Master." 

Nothing had changed in the room as she stood as before quit still, serenely patient. Only his whole perspective of the lounge and everything in it, including her, had changed dramatically. It seemed he was now her master with all that she had to offer placed at his disposal. He wondered what he had time for and what he should have her do first. 

"Show me your suspenders. Lift the dress higher. Up around your waist." He directed. He could feel himself licking his lips on having such a better view of those delectable black panties from when Angus had been there. "Turn around to face the television. Bend over." He ordered. 

"I knew it." She thought. Bending over was such a small thing to do yet dressed in the silly short dress made it so demeaning and even worse knowing she couldn't resist the instruction. Feeling the silk panties pull tight around her bottom, between her cheeks, was perfectly all right before Angus yet here it was so very terrible. It wasn't just having her head down that brought the blood pounding to her face. 

His breathing had become ragged as he watched the silk panties fold tightly between her cheeks. Drawn toward her he dropped to his knees. "Can I touch your bottom?" He asked in a whisper. 

With eyes tight shut she tried to block out what was happening hoping it would soon be over. It was a shock to hear him speak so close behind her. Without a thought she responded automatically. "You may do anything you want with me, master." She said. 

A shiver went through her body hoping this wasn't true, surely not, it couldn't be. How long would it before Angus returned? What would the young pest do with her? If only she had listened more to that conversation on the phone she might have realised Angus was leaving the house, leaving her helpless. She might have managed some protest or tried something to prevent this awful situation. She had been too long playing his games until now the subservient role was so very strong it was difficult to resist. 

His hands had already begun to pull the panties away from a pair of soft cheeks he found hiding there. Her crotch was inches from his face, which was demanding a lot more attention than he was giving it. He found her swaying a little, backwards and forwards. She had been taught to be an attentive servant to a master, obviously without specific direction that it should be Angus and only him. It was more than likely she had been continuously and repetitiously commanded to obey a master and now he was that master. For how long though, when would her husband get back to the rescue? 

With small movements she was swaying toward him as though tempting him with her sex. Swaying before his nose was her crotch, shaved clean to perfection, which was another of the services performed for her master. It didn't make it any easier that this young tormentor was so handsome. 

He held back telling himself this was a colleagues wife he had just pulled the panties from. More concerned with what would happen if he were caught, in the throws of passion on their lounge carpet, he pulled himself back to the armchair. He had to calm down and think. 

The telephone rang. He jumped in surprise. Turning in the chair he picked up the phone and murmured, "Jim, hello." Still in a dream state he listened to Angus. 

"I'm sorry Jim, can you stay on a little longer. I'm at the hospital. I might be here some time." 

He looked at Angus' wife, bent double, with a pair of black panties around her ankles. Her luscious cheeks were framed perfectly by stockings and suspenders. A pair of tumescent lips protruding between the thighs glistened with wetness. He cleared his throat. "Sure, no problem. How long do you think you'll be?"  

===

Jim gently replaced the phone with a shaking hand. Angus had told him he would be at the hospital for some time and why, though Jim had only heard he was to look after Melody. Perhaps Angus didn't realise how deeply she had been hypnotised or was relying on the password protecting her from Jim giving direct commands. After all she had never been left with someone else or even been in the presence of someone while hypnotised. 

Melody heard Jim talking to her husband on the phone wanting to shout for help, wishing for him to speed back to her rescue. Why had she been left like this at a stranger's mercy? If it were a game it was devilishly cruel. He hadn't actually touched her nonetheless she had never been so humiliated, bending over displaying her body so rudely. In her own lounge she had been put into this degrading situation with a complete stranger. Anger left her shaking. 

Jim couldn't keep his eyes off the delicious sight before him. The little black dress was up around her waist. The suspender straps curved around white cheeks clasping tight the seamed stockings. Her delectable arse was perfectly framed. Little involuntary movements of her legs thrust the lips between tightly clasped thighs as though her pussy were winking at him. 

The enticing sight of her rear brought him close like a snake being charmed across the room by the swaying of her hips. 

Hearing him move up close transformed the anger in an instant to fright, 'No! Stop.' She wanted to scream only the words wouldn't sound. 

"I want to kiss you." He said. 

It took a moment for the words to reach into a mind reeling from fear. 'No. Just let me go.' She thought. Involuntary words left her lips as programmed. "Yes, master." A fleeting moment of relief lifted her spirits at the thought of being able to move from this shameful position. Kissing him would be preferable to what she thought was about to happen while bent over with her panties around her ankles. 

Feeling his breath upon her bottom she froze in fright. Again she wanted to cry out. His lips touched hers. Her hazel eyes opened wide in dread. It wasn't her mouth he was kissing he was doing it to her down there. Clasping her legs together was no good her lips were protruding between them. A shiver quaked her belly. An anguished groan escaped her pursed mouth on feeling a tongue brush between those lips. 

'No! Please leave me alone.' Melody whimpered, only the sound was a shuddering out rush of breath. Realising she had pushed herself against him brought on a distraught whimpering. Feeling his tongue enter brought with it a need for more. The whimper changed to a yearning moan. When he sucked her pussy into his mouth she moaned in pure pleasure all thoughts of resistance washed away on a tide of desire. 

In one last desperate attempt she yelled with her mouth wide, 'Stop. Please stop.' Only the words were merely a guttural sound from her belly. Trying not to give in to her body the gyration of her hips was more a pulling away than the forward push it pleaded for. 

"I want to fuck you." He said. The words vibrated against her bud sending a shiver through her tummy, tingling her nipples. "Yes, master. Oh! Yes master. Yes please!" She moaned, at last giving way. Only a distant fading part of her mind remained to cry in despair. 

Devouring great gulps of air he rose up in one powerful motion to lunge into her. Lifting her onto tip toe with the momentum of the thrust he held her there a moment. Lowering her whole body with his penis he felt her grip tightly not wanting to lose the feeling of fullness. Instinct taking over his body he began to piston his hips with her taking up the rhythm. 

Like a machine over wound they desperately moved as one, breathed as one, cried out together in magnificent heaving breaths of sound. "I'm coming. Come." He shuddered, gripping her breasts forcefully. 

She needed no order to obey. The ultimate thrust filled her body sending quaking lava heat out from her sex washing through every nerve. Outside was a stiff unmoving thing while inside was awash with fire. The grip upon her breasts hurt wonderfully. 

Not wanting the wonderment to end she gripped his deflating penis until with a feeling of loss it slipped from her. She flopped upon the floor in an untidy heap upon him. Wanting to push him away, to run away, and the need to hold him equally charged her mind with emotion. 

Jim wrapped his arms around her. Brushing her hair to one side he kissed her forehead. "You had better go upstairs and shower. Go to bed and sleep." He told her. 

Reluctantly Melody dragged her feet up the stairs away from her lover but there was no choice she was impelled to obey. She wanted to stay with him clinging on to the warmth of the afterglow of the most satisfying orgasm ever experienced. Guilt swept over her at the thought and the realisation she had wanted him. It was easy to understand. He was young and handsome and it had been so naughty, such an illicit affair. 

Without thought she entered the guest bathroom, unconsciously refraining from using the on suite. Not wanting to enter their bedroom after being used like that, it wouldn't be right, while glowing from a marvellous orgasm with a stranger. Why hadn't he thought to command her to forget, it would have made things so much easier? Then again it had been an experience to remember. Frightening yet so very much a pleasure. 

Jim listened to the sounds of a shower eventually followed by the muffled patter of feet on soft carpet, the closing of a door brought silence to the house. Still on edge he waited the return of her husband. Angus didn't look the aggressive type but he had just taken his wife, what if he found out. They weren't really friends as such but at the very least it would cause a scene and how could they work together after this? 

Even the street noises had ceased in the early hours of the morning. Jim was on edge. Startled by the sound of a car pull up in the drive he jumped out of the armchair. Grabbing a book from a shelf he settled back down attempting to look comfortable and casual as though nothing had happened. 

"Hi, Jim. Thanks for holding the fort. Do you want a drink I could use one. I didn't know you were interested in trains?" Angus said over his shoulder. 

Jim looked at the book in his hands. The illustrations of steam locomotives obviously upside down, fortunately the plain red cover hadn't revealed the mistake. Slamming it closed he walked into the kitchen attempting to sound nonchalant. "She's upstairs asleep. I hope that's alright." 

"Oh. Yea. Thanks. Mother is sleeping too." Angus voice didn't betray his feelings, sounding light hearted as though returning an off hand remark. 

Jim caught a glimpse of tears in his eyes as Angus turned quickly to the kitchen counter. When handing over the glass they had been wiped away. "Mmm. Nice Scotch. So what happened?" 

"Mother is dead. That's it. She went peacefully. Didn't know what was happening. Thanks for looking after things Jim. Could you tell them in the office I won't be in. Monday." 

Jim made the usual commiserations glad that Angus was keeping his emotions to himself and quickly left. It was a fraught drive home trying to remember the way still not used to the hire car. He wanted to speed back to the sanctuary of the hotel room yet managed to keep within the law. Had he broken the law back there? 

*** Next morning she wondered where her lover was, what he was doing. It would have to be a naughty one off, it could never happen again. She had only allowed her husband to carry on with the silly hypnosis thing to keep him happy. At least he paid her more attention than his hobby even if the sex had been a little one sided. Now it would have to stop. He didn't have to know about what happened last night but somehow she would have to tell him it couldn't go on, just in case. What if someone else, some stranger took her like that? It was too terrible to think about. 

Still not having worked out how to broche the subject of hypnosis with him she served breakfast. He seemed more distracted than usual and she became afraid he had found out. When he told her his mother had died in the night the weekend became a torture of unbearable guilt. He was still unaware that she knew about the hypnosis so she kept quiet, giving him space. Fortunately he kept to his room intent on the hobby, reading and planning trips that never happened, as he often did. It was his way of dealing with emotional issues and it seemed to work for him. 

*** 

Judy looked after personnel, security and a multitude of other office tasks in the branch office. She made some clicking noises with her tongue then asked. "I knew she was ill as he had time off recently but not that ill. Any idea when the funeral will be?" 

Jim figured all she was interested in was when he would return to the office. "I'll phone him later. In the meantime I need to complete the reports. I need his password." He told her. The word password had taken on a new secret meaning but he managed to say it without cringing. 

The morning was spent immersed in figures where he escaped from dwelling on the betrayal of a colleagues trust. Inevitably he couldn't resist looking at some personal documents and there he found the password. He had already found that out but above it was another phrase, obviously the one that put her into a trance. There was nothing else, no explanation of what it referred to so if anyone came across the document it would be meaningless. Still, it was pretty useless even to him as there wouldn't be an opportunity to use it even if he wanted to. 

*** 

"Hello Angus how are things?" Jim asked. 

Judy nodded at a chair meaning for him to sit. It felt crowded in the small office and he was nervous in Angus presence having not seen him since that Friday night over a week ago. 

"Angus has just come in to hand his notice in. Under the circumstances I think it's reasonable he doesn't have to work a months notice. Could you fill in until we get a replacement? Sorry to land you in it like this but, well, you know." Judy shrugged her shoulders attempting an appealing expression instead ended up looking pathetic. 

"Sure. Anything to help." Jim replied, looking instead at Angus. The gut seemed OK but why was he doing this, had he found out? "Have you cleared it with head office? I've already overstayed the couple of weeks originally arranged." 

"I thought I would run it by you first." Judy said, attempting now to sound and look helpful. 

'You damn well know what your doing. How can I say no in front of Angus.' He thought. 

Angus smiled. "I'm sorry about this Jim. I'll spend a few hours with you, filling you in. I'm sure you can handle it." 

Back at the desk they sat close, hunched over the computer screen. "This is all a bit sudden Angus, are you sure?" 

Angus interrupted. "I've been through all that with Judy. I've made up my mind. If I don't escape now I never will. There's nothing stopping me now mother's gone. It reminded me how short life is. We work, retire a few years then die. Sorry! I'm OK. I'm going to live life the way I want, do what I want. I've made plans to travel for so long then just torn them up, not this time." 

"What did your wife say?" Jim asked quietly, not wanting to use her name in case it exposed his feelings. 

"Not much. I was surprised. Perhaps she doesn't believe it. Anyway, I'll pack when I get free of this place, she'll believe it then. The mortgage is paid up, she has her inheritance to live on, and she'll be OK." 

"Where will you go?" 

"Canada first. By train through the Rockies then down through the states to South America, as far as the rails take me. Right down to the tip of Argentina. After that Europe, then there's the trans Siberian railway, right across to China. Melody won't go of course she'd be bored out of her mind." His eyes glowed with the idea of freedom, of the immensity of the plans he had pored over for years. 

"That's really something." Jim responded hardly knowing what to say. It would be his idea of hell but then a weekend Jazz festival would probably leave Angus feeling the same way. 

"Come over for dinner before I go. I need to thank you for, well, taking care of all this." Angus laughed with a wave of his hand taking in the office.  

===

Arriving at his work mates' home Jim wondered if he should just keep on driving past but somehow managed to walk to the door and ring the bell. 

"Hi Jim, glad you could make it." The large man shook his hand in a warm grip obviously unaware that Jim had taken his wife a few days ago. 

One hurdle was over but what would it be like meeting Melody again. 

"Hello Jim. It's nice to meet you after all the good things my husband has said about you. He is so pleased with you taking over the office on such short notice, he can get away that much sooner." Melody laughed, hiding the embarrassment behind a smile. It was unnerving talking to this young man who had taken her in her own home, like a secret affair it had to be kept confidential. She had to pretend not to know anything about it herself and having to act as though it never happened was a strain. 

Despite the naughty secret she was happy not having been hypnotised for the last two weeks. When Angus started his travels she would be left in peace, without the worry of telling her husband that she knew what he had been doing to her the last two years. The problem of telling him had only arisen with the fear that a stranger might take advantage of her as Jim had. 

Jim thought Melody looked radiant. Obviously dressed and decorated without a man's influence she looked more attractive than when he had seen her last. How that could be possible Jim couldn't work out, the subtle female differences were beyond him. Perhaps it was the smile that shone from an inner contentment or maybe it was that he knew she wore stockings under that captivating dress. No cleavage was revealed and it was long yet more alluring. 

As they sat with an aperitif Jim looked around the ordinary room hardly able to believe anything unusual had happened in that very lounge two weeks ago. Trying to put it out of his mind he concentrated on making small talk. 

"So when are you off Angus?" He asked. 

"Tomorrow morning. I have a flight to Canada then a local train to Vancouver to pick up the Rockies Special." 

"Don't get him started on all that. I thought he was going to take me with him only I'm pleased to say it's to be a solitary adventure. Excuse me but I need to see to dinner. Just don't bore the young man, try to think of something else for a change." Melody teased her husband on the way out of the door. 

"Didn't she mind you going?" Jim asked. 

"No. Not at all! She seemed relieved, not just from avoiding a boring trip on trains for a couple of months. She seemed to be glad to see me gone. I guess we've been married long enough to need some space. How are you set up here in town, still in that crummy motel room? Well, why don't you move in here until you find an apartment? It would make me feel better if you were keeping an eye on the place and looking out for Melody. This neighbourhood looks nice but you never know who's wondering around." Angus suggested. 

Jim protested but before he could get really going on a list of excuses Melody called them into the dinning room. 

Melody choked on a potato when Angus mentioned his idea; quickly recovering she scolded her husband. "I'm sure Jim would rather have his own space. It's just the thought of you paying out for a hotel room that's inspired this idea. Angus doesn't like to spend money needlessly." 

"She's a good cook, there's plenty of room here and it's a good security measure." Angus looked mindfully at Jim, with a slight frown. "He's not involved with anyone and will be too busy for late nights out with the boys, besides the guys in the office are too old or too married to be much fun. You could still claim your motel room on expenses from head office." Angus winked at Jim. It seemed he wouldn't take no for an answer. 

After dinner the two men sipped port in the lounge mellowing. "Jim. If you were here you could keep an eye on her for me. Just in case the hypnosis causes a problem. I don't think it will, but, in an emergency there needs to be someone here to look out for her. Just say yes." 

Jim thought about it and the idea began to grow on him. "Alright, I'll see how it goes." He could always move out while Angus was away and felt sure Melody wouldn't object when he did. 

Melody was worried by the idea of Jim moving in not just because she was looking forward to having her own space. So far she hadn't thought what to do with so-called free time and what was space anyway. Although Jim knew the password he couldn't use it until she was hypnotised and no one but Angus knew the phrase to put her under. It meant she was safe yet there was a pleasant awareness of a little danger agreeing to him staying. 

*** 

Next morning Jim carried a suitcase into the house, containing the meagre possessions brought to town. Everything from the apartment at home was in storage. He'd made that arrangement over the phone since learning he was to stay at the branch office. So what now? Melody seemed a little distant, slightly nervous about a stranger invading her home. He was travelling light so it would be easy to back out of the arrangement and find another motel room 

"What have you done to your neck?" He asked. 

"Oh! I must have slept awkwardly. Would you like a coffee?" She asked, meaning to escape to the kitchen out of his way. She knew it was from tension; the awkwardness of having Jim in the house. Somehow she was going to manoeuvre him out or perhaps arrange a vacation for herself, somewhere warm and relaxing with attentive staff. 

He followed her not feeling comfortable just plonking himself down in the lounge waiting to be served. Perhaps this wasn't such a good idea after all. "Can I help?" 

Hearing his voice sp close behind her she dropped a cup into the sink. 'I must be more on edge than I realised.' She thought. 

Deciding to make her feel more at ease Jim whispered the phrase into her ear. He watched her straighten with both arms at her sides, a neutral expression upon her face. She seemed to be waiting for something and it wasn't a train. 

Melody inwardly gasped. 'No! How did he find that out?' She was suddenly so terribly vulnerable in a too familiar hypnotic trance. 'What will he do to me?' She dare not imagine. This state had been deepened over months of practice with her husband until it had become irresistible. At the moment he couldn't command her to do anything but she was powerless to run away and hide from him. What made it so galling was that she had inadvertently revealed the password that would enable him to order her about. She was powerless to prevent him saying it. All he had to do now was say the password and she would be completely under his control. 

Jim spoke the password and contemplated on what to do next. "Sit on that chair. Try to relax." 

Melody was surprised for this wasn't expected at all. She was still wearing clothes, which was some small comfort. As ordered she tried to relax with his hands massaging her neck. They drifted around her shoulders gripping stiff muscles easing them. The inner tension was melting away too. 

"You will be relaxed around me." Jim ordered her. He thought for a moment trying to get the words right. "You will enjoy having me here and will be happy to share your home with me." He emphasised the words you and me. "Even when not hypnotised you will be pleased to see me and want me to be here. When I bring you round you will remember the massaging and not be surprised at it happening and look forward to another massage." 

Jim stepped back from her and uttered another phrase to bring her round. 

Melody twisted her neck slowly back and forth. "Wow! You have a magic touch. I feel so relaxed and my neck feels just great." She remembered everything as usual as her husband had neglected to tell her to forget these hypnotic episodes assuming she wouldn't remember. Still, she did feel calm and the ache was gone. Perhaps he wasn't going to take advantage of her; after all she was older than him, too old, not attractive to a young man. Despite knowing it was the influence of a hypnotic order she felt relaxed and this was a good start to his moving in. The start of what exactly would have to be discovered. 

"I had better make that coffee." She smiled. "Just take your things upstairs. I've made the bed and cleared the room. Just let me know if you need anything." 

In the lounge she relaxed with a mug of white coffee, no sugar, like his. "Tell me about yourself, I don't know you at all." They talked finding little in common yet plenty to laugh about. He volunteered to take care of the garden but a gardener came in once a week and the house was well decorated and maintained. 

"You can look after me then." She said, flushing with embarrassment at the look of amusement he returned. 

"Well I can do that for sure. Do you have plans for this evening?" He said. 

A little thrill coursed through her body at the thought of what he was hinting at. It was no surprise that her thoughts turned to that naughty evening and her eyes turned to the spot where she had been bent over displaying herself so wantonly. "Not really. I've got to get used to having all my time to myself." She said hesitantly. 

He uttered the phrase once more watching her rise from the armchair to stand vacantly before him. Without hesitation he spoke the password. "Now let's get you changed into something more comfortable. You look good in those jeans and tee shirt but much better in a dress. Or perhaps it's what you wear underneath that is so alluring." 

She followed him upstairs in a state of excitement no longer able to feel afraid of him. It was disconcerting to know he had ordered her to feel relaxed and happy to be in his company but there was nothing she could do about that, or anything else. 

'Damn!' She thought, 'he's going through my wardrobe.' It would have given her at least some leeway if he had just told her to wear a dress whereas now he was going to find the naughty outfits Angus had bought for her. 

"Well that's sexy. That's the maid's outfit you wore the first time I was here. What's this then? You have a collection of corsets hidden away at the back." Soon the bed was filled with discarded garments. "You can try these on while I decide which is best. Now this is interesting. Three draws of underwear. Start with this and select the appropriate underwear." He said, holding up a skimpy dress. 

Stripping off the sensible clothes she felt so very vulnerable and embarrassed. It wouldn't have been so bad wearing something, even the old unmatched bra and panties would have been better than nothing. His eyes on her body as she bent over the draws rummaging through for something reasonable to wear underneath left her feeling humiliated. 

She squeezed her thighs together in an attempt to hide at least something from his gaze. 

"No that's far too dreary. Find something racy, exciting." 

A red half cup bra with matching thong came to hand as though by magic and before she could bury it in the pile he told her it was perfect. Trying to remain calm and maintain some dignity she dressed only to feel it was a strip tease in reverse. The look in his eyes told her plainly he liked what he saw. It was as though she had just gift wrapped her body as a present for him until he was ready to strip off the packaging and play with it. Every scything movement of stocking clad thighs, every bounce of her breasts in the little bra seemed to emphasise the feeling of being his toy. The indignity was all the more shaming on becoming excited and ready for him to use her. 

In the dinning room she served lunch waiting on him as she had that first evening. The compliments on her cooking were thoughtful but it was the light touches to her thighs and bottom that were captivating her attention. It was impossible not to become excited and wanting more. 

"You had better call me, Sir. While we are alone of course, otherwise carry on calling me Jim. If anyone calls just behave normally as though you weren't hypnotised but remember to obey me." 

"Yes Sir." She answered demurely. The significance of his words flooded her with alarm. He obviously intended to keep her hypnotised for some time. Angus had never gotten around to keeping her like this for a whole day, just a couple of hours playing around in the evening. The mention of someone calling while so helpless was frightening. Up until then she had been excited at what he might do with her not thinking it through at all. It was stupid to be in this vulnerable position where a young man was in complete control of her in her own home. 

The touch of his hand on a near bare bottom, gently stroking it, calmed her. The sensuousness of it drove away the fretful thoughts. The little thong could so easily be pushed aside and it became a frustrating tease that he didn't. 

It was driving her mad being kept in a state of arousal all day. When was he going to finish what he had started? Every time she caught sight of herself in the filmy little dress it brought a thrill. Bending over to show off the thong or bending over him revealing a deep cleavage was so naughty it was making her wet. 

When close he would reach out and pet her, stroking her sensitized flesh with light fingertip brushes. A nipple accidentally slipped out for him to pinch then smoothly caress the breast back in leaving her pulse pounding. When he cupped her sex in one hand she nearly came but that was all she managed; to come so close yet never reach a climax was almost painful. 

"Put these on I found them in your wardrobe." He told her. 

The high heels were slipped over stocking clad feet and as she did he purposefully separated her legs to examine her. He could feel how wet she was and that mortified her. 

"Tell me how you feel, right here." He asked cupping her between the legs. 

She squirmed at the lewd suggestion knowing she had to answer however intimate and revealing it would be. "Wet, Sir." 

"That's avoiding the issue. What do you want right here?" He demanded. 

The words fluttered from her lips before she could think of a less damning reply. "I want you, Sir. I want to come. Please Sir, let me come. Make me come. Let me have your cock in there." Ashamed at revealing such private thoughts, as well as the lurid words she used to express them, she looked down at the floor in embarrassment. 

Jim studied her thinking she was either a submissive by nature or had been brought to this state after so long being dominated under hypnosis. Well it didn't mater much either way. He was going to give her what she wanted eventually. He wanted her right there on the floor in the kitchen, right now. He took a deep breath and steadied himself. 

"Follow me." He commanded. 

Eagerly she trotted after him on high heels into the hall. He steadied her climb of the stairs with a hand to her bottom. Without being told she led the way into the bedroom. "Crawl onto the bed on hands and knees." He ordered. 

On his back he slipped between her legs looking up at her sex. Pulling the thong to one side he kissed her gently then sucked. It felt as though he was pulling her inside out. Her legs trembled. He moved on up the bed to pull the dress down uncovering a nipple, which he grasped between his teeth. When he licked the other she almost cried with anticipation until he sucked it into his mouth. She twisted her hips luxuriating in the feelings trembling through her breasts and chest. He moved upward to look into her eyes. Her focus was lost with tears of pleasure blurring everything. He nibbled upon her lips reminding her of what he had done between her legs, re-igniting the sensations. 

"Sit up. Lower yourself onto me." He casually told her. 

So deep was the longing she wouldn't have needed to be hypnotised for there was no way to resist her body demanding attention. It demanded satisfaction and on contact with his hardness all strength seemed to give way. She fell upon him burying it deep inside her body feeling all of it, feeling it expanding to fill her right up. He arched his back strongly lifting her to reach so much further she thought it was filling her belly. 

"Move up and down. You know what to do." He encouraged. 

She didn't know what to do from experience, having never tried anything but a missionary position but all she knew was that she wanted his cock inside her. She pushed with her legs lifting her sex to the head of his penis then let her weight drop upon it once more only this time it reached deeper. The movements became faster and more frantic. 

A gust of breath left her throat with a sound of a wailing wolf. It was so tight and deep within her body she felt every juddering movement as he came. She responded with a whimper for at last she too was coming. Exploding with a star burst of nerves tingling outward from her sex the orgasm was all consuming. Down both legs ripples of lightning scorched taught nerves, over her stomach ripples of heat throbbed. Her chest heaved once then her whole body tensed. His slightest quiver sending sensations that seemed too powerful to be withstood, her whole mind telling her to freeze, don't move, hold on to it. 

She clenched her thighs, learning to tighten inner muscles too, attempting to hold on to his retreating form. She didn't need more, she just needed to feel him inside; she craved for it there. Collapsing onto his chest she felt him clasp her body tightening the two into one. 

They fell asleep as one until she opened her eyes to see he too was coming round. She lay there not wanting to move not wanting to be free of his arms. 

"Let's shower." He murmured. 

Together they soaped their bodies with soft suds cleaning the sweat of the intense activity away. 

He was hungry and she was eager to please. No longer conscious of the brief outfit, nor bothered by the loss of underwear, she wantonly nuzzled against him whenever a hand closed upon her. The evening was spent this way in the dining room then in the lounge where she kneeled at his feet contentedly awaiting his command. 

That night she enjoyed his wanting her and his need matched hers in return. Less frantic yet as satisfying they made love. 

Sunday arrived with the joy of knowing he was there. He dressed her in a more flowing feminine dress, still without underwear except suspenders and stockings yet she was pleased for her body to be available to his slightest whim. It was a lazy day with them content to merely be together. Working on chores around the house brought the feeling that she wanted to be back beside him letting him tease her body. 

In the afternoon she was working through each room in the house collecting wastebaskets ending up in the garden emptying them into a bin. 

"Hi! How are you getting on without Angus?" A neighbour asked, leaning over the fence. 

She smiled, startled from a reverie, not knowing what to say. "I'll push the rubbish-bin into the street for you. It's collection day Monday, tomorrow." He said, as though she might have forgotten. 

Ordered to behave normally she did just that within the limits of being hypnotised. "Thanks Howard but Angus has arranged everything as usual. He arranged for someone to stay, to take care of things. Jim will move it out later." She said noticing he was looking at her with a curious look upon his face. 

With the sun shining low her shadow was cast upon the fence as a silhouette of her body. The sun was shining right through the thin summer dress and she inwardly cringed. He was sure to see the suspender belt and she had been standing with her legs apart balancing the wastebasket ready to tip it. Without panties or bra the dress was nothing more than a thin veil over her naked body. It wasn't the cool afternoon air that had her nipples standing to attention it was the constant stimulation. 

He kept her talking, or rather listening, while his eyes roved from between her legs to her breasts and back. She couldn't move. So used to being ordered by another she waited for him to let her go. As much as she wanted to she just couldn't take the initiative. The voice of his wife crashed over the fence and as though caught stealing apples he scurried off with a hasty farewell. Relieved at escaping the embarrassing situation she escaped back to the kitchen and smiled a little impish grin.

*** 

"I was thinking of those outfits at the back of your wardrobe. We'll try them out and see which one is the sexiest." Jim told her. 

The smile on his face was so wonderful she eagerly rushed up the stairs. Stripping off she stood naked in the bedroom while he delved in among the clothes. A glint of light attracted her attention to the mirror. In one corner she caught the movement again. She couldn't see anyone but could see a neighbours' window. Howard was spying on her from the house next door. Had he seen her stripping off? She had closed the blinds to the window looking out over the front lawn but had been ordered to get undressed before reaching that small window. If he had a pair of binoculars he would be able to see everything. 

She groaned inwardly, unable to say anything to warn Jim or move away from the window or the mirror. From behind her neighbour had a clear view of her bottom and everything else in the mirror. Melody hoped Jim would hurry up with some clothes. She felt so vulnerable being helpless and naked before that awful man. 

"Climb on the bed, on all fours." Jim told her. Though feeling humiliated there was no choice but kneel on the bed looking out through the window now seeing for sure he was there. He watched as her body was being worked upon, as thoroughly as yesterday, with less effect now as she was being watched. She couldn't look away from the binoculars that were clearly in sight watching everything. He was watching her move up and down with her breasts bouncing in a steady rhythm. At some point she ceased to see anything, her eyes tight shut, as she came. Again it was a tremendous expansion of sensations coursing through her body bringing her to collapse upon her young lover. 

There was no escaping what happened even as she descended the stairs her thoughts were in overdrive. It was clear in her mind, Howard had watched her undress then watched her dress and everything in between, her secrets all revealed. What was she to do? Events were piling up getting out of control but of course they already were way beyond her control. 

She had freely let her husband hypnotise her over the months until it had taken a firm hold of her mind. But then she hadn't foreseen how it could turn into this dangerous torrid game, a game where she was just a pawn. Being hypnotised for a whole weekend was tying the already strong knot so much tighter about her mind she wondered how much resistance there was left. Melody wasn't even sure how much she enjoyed being the young mans plaything and how much it was a command that she must enjoy it. 

Her mind was in turmoil as she went through the usual routine of preparing a meal in the kitchen. What must her neighbour think of their antics in the bedroom? She would have to wait and see what happened. At least tomorrow Jim would leave for the office leaving her free to untangle this web she had helped create for herself, if that were possible. She would have to try, try something.  

===

The doorbell rang. Melody wiped her hands on a towel and padded on bare feet from the kitchen. With her mind still in turmoil over what had happened at the weekend she answered the door. The next-door neighbour, Howard, was standing there. In a flash her mind cleared to the present. 

This lecherous neighbour had watched her make love to Jim from his house next door. Jim hadn't thought to close the curtains and being hypnotised she hadn't been able to. She had simply carried out his instructions although if she was honest she had been too excited to think straight anyway. 

The memory of discovering Howard watching her, unable to do anything about it, brought back the feelings of guilt and shame. He had watched her undress and mount her young lover until an orgasm overwhelmed her. Any chance that he hadn't really seen the lewd show was destroyed now he had taken the trouble to make this rare visit. 

It was no coincidence that Jim had just left for the office, so now what did he want? Although Melody was still hypnotised Jim had left instructions that she was to act normal if anyone called. This was some small relief. The hypnotic state had grown gradually stronger over the past two years and being under its influence for a whole weekend had tightened its powerful control. 

"Hello Melody. How are you?" He asked. She made the mistake of standing back form the door, which allowed him to walk in. "Have you heard from Angus. Is he enjoying his trip?" 

"He will phone today sometime." She replied, while attempting to figure out how to get rid of him. 

"I wondered if there was something I could do to help while he was away." He said. 

"I don't think so." She said. Her voice sounded calm not revealing how flustered she was. She followed him down the hall into the kitchen. 

"You don't look too good. I expect your missing him. Sit down and I'll make a cup of coffee. We can have a chat, catch up on what's being going on." He told her. 

She perched on a stool in the kitchen. It dawned on her that she had obeyed his instruction to sit down so she really did need to get rid of him somehow. In fear she wondered what he had in mind. He might inadvertently order her around and discover how vulnerable she was. 

"I noticed you had a visitor. Is he staying with you for long?" 

"Yes he's looking after me until Angus gets back." Embarrassed at what the words really meant she looked down at her lap then quickly looked up at Howard. He was licking his lips staring at the sight of stocking tops and suspenders where the little dress had ridden up. 

"Does Angus know how well you too are getting on?" He asked. 

That was unmistakably a reference to what he had spied from his window. Without a thought she replied. "No." She had no choice but to answer. The instruction to act normal was simply that, an act. It didn't seem to have much depth so she was definitely in trouble. 

Howard was around fifty-five but not passed it. What would he do with this sordid piece of information? Little did he know blackmail wasn't necessary for he could simply order her to obey. What little perversions this older man might have she shuddered to think about. 

Placing the coffee cup beside her on the breakfast counter left him standing too close for comfort. 

"There's no need to tell him. I'm sure we can come to some arrangement to avoid any unpleasantness." He said. His hand rested lightly upon her knee. When she neglected to resist the hand slid up to a suspender belt caressing her thigh. "I thought you might see it my way. Do as I say and no one need know of your secret fling." He sighed. 

Melody shuddered in anguish at his words for he had just ordered her to do as he said. He was standing close before her parting her thighs and there was nothing she could do to stop it. She felt his sweaty palms rub her unprotected thighs with fingertips nudging the skimpy panties. 

He leaned forward to lick her cleavage giving her a close up of his bald patch. She tried to switch off, to think of something else, to let him just get on with it. With a gasp of relief she felt him move away from her. Opening her eyes it was a relief to see he wasn't unzipping his trousers. Perhaps he was passed it after all. 

"Was that a little gasp of pleasure my dear?" 

He didn't give her a chance to answer. She wondered if it would have made any difference if she had told him the truth. That she was disgusted at his touch. That she was relieved to think he had finished with her. 

"Stand up. Bend over the table." He told her. 

In despair she obeyed. 

"Pull up your dress. Such a beautiful bottom so well framed by those stockings and suspenders. A peach my dear. You are right not hide it in a pair of knickers. A thong is just perfect. Squeeze your thighs together." He sighed in satisfaction. 

Melody wondered if looking would be enough. His breathing indicated a heart attack and she hoped for it. Her humiliation was complete on feeling her lips protrude between her thighs knowing the view he had of them. The tiny panties merely cupped her pussy lips in white cotton. 

"Such a delightful image Mrs Angus McArthur." 

She squirmed at being reminded of her position. 

"That is an enticing wiggle you have there. I could watch it all day but there just isn't the time. Pull down the thong. You can wiggle that delightful bottom for me again. Keep it going, dear." 

She thought he was simply watching the squirming of her lips as they rolled between her thighs but she was mistaken. She felt something cold against her bottom. Fear of the unknown halted the shameful movements. He was rubbing it between the cheeks of her bottom then down over her pussy warming it. Pushing it into her pussy shaped it as it softened from her body heat. 

The slab of hard cooking fat straight from the fridge had startled her but now it was shaped into a cylinder. He eased into her bottom. The slippery substance was resisted but nevertheless intruded into her. "Don't resist it. It will help make it easier for you. I don't intend to share your pussy with that young man." He told her. 

For a moment she thought he wasn't going to take her but then it struck like a slap what he meant. He wasn't going to take her pussy he was going to rape her bottom. As ordered she relaxed letting him grease her arse. 

She felt a hardness poke between her cheeks then slide down the cleft into position. Soundlessly she cried out. 'No! Not that. Please don't. Take my pussy, not that. Please fuck my pussy. Please fuck my pussy.' There was no self-conscious shame in begging him to fuck her. She meant it and would have pleaded with him out loud if she could. 

She gasped as he slid into her. Slowly his hardness drove deep into her body. There was no escape from the feeling of it burrowing in ever deeper. Pulling on her tight sheath it felt huge on its outward movement. The pace began to increase. The solid mass was powering into her yet she unwillingly gripped it tight. Eventually she felt him shudder with quick little movements. In distress she felt it spurt a sperm enema deep into her greased hole. 

This was no wild pleasure as experienced with Jim. This was a thing to be endured. The pain subsided as he shrunk back from her. 

"Your quit a slut Mrs McArthur." He breathed heavily. 

Irrationally she hoped he wouldn't have the heart attack now, leaving her to be found so indecently. What a picture it would make with him dead on the kitchen floor. She with her panties around her ankles, spread over the kitchen table, arse up and greased. 

"You're my slut now. Perhaps not all mine but most certainly my little slut. Clean yourself up while I finish this coffee. Best take that dress off first." He told her. 

With him examining her every movement she soaped herself at the sink bent over with a soapy cloth between her legs. It took some time but he was careful not to miss anything of the show. 

After he left she collapsed on the floor her nerves shattered. Was this to be her lot in life? Jim would be taking her pussy and the neighbour would be abusing her bottom. Realising how vulnerable she had become led to more terrifying thoughts. Anyone calling at the house might decide to make a play for the lonely housewife dressed like a slut. 

Melody groaned on remembering the dirty old man had told her she was a slut. Until the order was countermanded she would be a slut, flirting with any man who came along. She would have to tell Jim the danger she was in and reveal she remembered everything he had done to her. She could only do that when he released her. She dare not contemplate what might happen if he kept her hypnotised until Angus returned.  

===

It was nearly five and Jim would be home soon so Melody changed into a maid outfit for him as ordered. The outfit was a low cut dress flared out to reveal stocking tops and white ruffles of petticoats. For once she didn't admire herself in the mirror, being too preoccupied to care what she looked like. 

Could she tell Jim what happened this morning even if he brought her out of the hypnotic state? At the moment she was powerless to say anything but answer his questions and obey him. It was all her fault it had gone so terribly wrong. If she hadn't let her husband hypnotise her so often its power over her wouldn't be so strong. 

That it was overpowering was confirmed when a neighbour walked in and took her roughly. He hadn't realised she was hypnotised and couldn't resist him. He thought she was stunned by his threat of blackmail. She shuddered at the thought of it. It was no good she would have to tell Jim as soon as he lifted the influence so as to avoid that nasty man. She couldn't let it happen again. 

Melody heard him from the kitchen run upstairs to change into jeans and t- shirt. Her master was home. Carrying in a tray of food she placed it before him then stood ready to serve, as programmed. 

"You look smashing in that dress Melody. Even without the high heels your legs look long. It's those stockings and suspenders that do it." 

She wasn't in the mood for his compliments while still smouldering with anger and suffering in anguish over what had happened. 

"Did Angus ever tell you about Roger feeding the squirrels behind the office building?" He asked between forks' of lasagne. 

"Yes, master." She dutifully replied. 

"Well he ran back in this morning and dragged everyone outside to show them what had happened. He told everyone the squirrels didn't like the black dog biscuits because they had brought them all back. He was convinced these squirrels had picked them out and brought a week's worth of them back. Everyone was laughing but he was totally convinced. Apparently a couple of office juniors had collected them during the week and came in early to scatter them outside on the lawn." Jim laughed at the memory of Roger talking about it all day to anyone who would listen. 

He stopped eating for a moment to look at Melody and the lack of a reaction. "I guess you had to be there. I'm not very good at telling jokes anyway." He put the fork down. "This is no good. Well it is sometimes." He said with a grin lighting his face. "I guess I can't keep you like this all the time. It's no good." 

Melody cringed inwardly knowing the moment of truth was close. She would have to reveal she remembered what had happened while hypnotised. He, like Angus, thought she didn't remember the naughty things they made her do. Jim would find out she had colluded in the games they played. All this dressing up and the sex too! He would know she enjoyed being dominated, being helpless. Would he believe she hadn't wanted the neighbour to do those dreadful things to her? 

He sent her upstairs to change and she joined him at the table to eat diner. He uttered the phrase she both dreaded and needed to be said. Melody was now his landlady and friends wife. "So how has your day been Melody?" Jim politely asked. 

She hesitated a moment then stammered. "I have something to tell you. Something awful happened. I would appreciate it if you just listened." She said, and then told him the sordid tale. 

Jim sat quiet still. He was stunned to think she knew all that had happened between them and angry with what the neighbour had done to her. "It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have left you helpless like that." He said. The feeling of guilt overwhelmed him fuelling his anger. "The bastard! I'll kill him." Jim shouted. 

"No! You can't confront him. Please, just sit down. We'll just have to be more careful in future." She stopped suddenly realising she had inadvertently told him she wanted to continue with the games. 

Jim didn't sit down he couldn't. It was difficult to face her knowing she was aware of how he had taken advantage of her. Was he any better than that beast next door? He walked, almost running, out of the front door straight up to the neighbour's house. Banging on the door brought no response. He marched round to the back door straight into the kitchen. 

Peeping from behind a curtain Howard was too afraid to open the front door. When he saw the young man turn toward the back of the house he scrambled toward the back door. Too late! He almost ran into him. "Get out!" He said. Spittle sprayed from his open mouth. "I have a bad heart." He moaned. 

"A bad mind too. You bastard! Keep away from Melody or I'll wring your bloody scrawny neck. No more spying from that room either." Jim shouted at him. 

"You can't talk to me like that young man. This is my home. I'll tell Angus what you two have been up to." Howard whined. 

"Angus already knows. He asked me to stay. I'm there to look after her. If you start spreading gossip we'll hear about it. You won't be able to spread the dirt again. Do you understand? Does your wife know you've been spying on Melody? Watching her get undressed. Does she know you visited her this morning? What you did to her." Jim ranted with a finger pocking his chest. 

Howard's jowls wobbled with his mouth flapping sounds not words. 

Jim grabbed his belt and shook him. "Well?" 

"No." He mumbled. 

"You can't undo what you did. Melody was shocked when you barged into her home. You violated her. You nasty piece of shit!" 

From the onslaught of words and anger the man crumpled into himself. His legs gave way with Jim lowering him to the floor. "I won't say anything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." He bleated over and over. 

Jim lost the edge to his temper. Watching the man whimpering he felt disgusted. Jim's guilt wasn't spent but it seemed to have been appeased for the moment. 

Back behind the front door he hesitated. Leaning back against it he sighed, unsure if he could remain staying there with Melody. His own words came back to him. 'Angus already knows.' Did Angus arrange all of this? Did he set him up? If so that would explain how easy it had been for him to move in and take over. 

What wasn't supposed to happen was for the neighbour to bugger Melody. "Damn!" Jim exclaimed. "Angus told me to look after her. I let them both down." 

Jim heard a sound from upstairs. He climbed them feeling his legs heavy, weary from the emotion of confrontation. Maybe he was unsure of what to do next but he was sure of one thing. He would have to make it right with Melody before he left. 

"He won't bother you again. He'll keep the curtains drawn and his mouth shut." Jim said. Before he could think what to say next, how to apologise, Melody interrupted. 

"Go down stairs and wait for me in the lounge." She told him. 

She walked in wearing the maid outfit high heels included this time. "You must promise to look after me." She said quietly. "Don't make me forget one moment. You promise. OK. Say the words." 

Melody went from looking nervous to a relaxed pose with arms at her sides, waiting for him. 

Jim wondered if it could ever be the same again. The sight of her dressed to thrill began to rouse him. He had a lot to make up for. She had given herself to him and so now he knew he had been doing something right. He remembered that first evening where they had started all this, in this very room. 

"Turn around. Bend over the sofa" He said, in almost a whisper. 

He crawled across the floor to her and kissed her bare thighs above the stockings. He reached up to her breasts and pulled them from the dress to knead them gently. Rolling her nipples between his fingers they began to stiffen. She was ready for him. With his teeth he pulled the crotch of her panties away and nuzzled her there. 

He pulled away noticing she pushed back wanting more. "Down on the floor." He said, not needing to explain. He parted her legs. Gazing for a moment at the glistening moist lips he watched her hips rise off the floor summoning him. He enjoyed the moment, watching Melody squirm in pleasure and frustration. 

The little black dress was up around her hips with her breasts pushed out the top. He leaned over to massage them. Dropping his head between her legs he kissed one lip then the other, sucking it into his mouth to nibble it. One long stroke with the tongue from end to end nearly finished her off but he held back. Again he watched her squirming, lifting her hips in frustration, wanting more, needing more. 

He stood up and told her. "Stand up. Straighten your dress. Now go and tidy up the dining room. When you're finished bring me a beer." 

"Right away, master." She said. 

Melody screamed inside. 'I'm your slut. Please fuck me.' She wanted to wrestle him to the floor, to tear off his clothes, yet all she could do was obey the order. While washing up she told herself he was doing this for her. He had worked out this is what she wanted. Had she always been like this wanting to be dominated and to be used? 'I'm his slut and must do as he says.' She wailed silently. 

With legs trembling she brought him a beer as ordered. He was sitting low on the sofa with a clear view of her panties and this small thing gave her a thrill. Already quaking with excitement she needed very little to keep her going. Bending over to drag a small table over to him for his beer she was able to show off her bottom. Leaning forward her breasts were on display. 

In nervous haste she spilt the drink. "Look what you've done girl." He scolded her. He took a hold of a wrist pulling her over his lap. "You must be careful to please me, maid. You're here to serve me or suffer the consequences." He gently slapped her bare bottom, then again. 

"I'm sorry, Sir. It won't happen again, Sir." Standing demurely before him she felt humiliated. She was a married woman and this young man had spanked her over his knee, in her own home. Now she had to stand before him with her knickers around her ankles waiting to be dismissed like some errant schoolgirl. 

Scooting off to fetch a cloth, and another beer, she was determined to be more careful this time. While he sipped at the glass she knelt on the floor wiping up the mess. 

"While your down there you can attend another of your tasks, maid. Crawl over here." He commanded imperiously. 

Eagerly she unzipped the jeans almost grabbing him too roughly. He didn't complain. 

Without need of instruction she licked the full length of his hardened cock. She kissed and licked his balls on a parallel to his treatment of her earlier. With her lips around the head of his cock she juggled his balls lightly with fingertips. Breathing deeply through her nose she drove her head down firmly taking him all. She swallowed his penis feeling it tight in her throat. Lifting her head she kept it wrapped tight between her lips while flicking it with her tongue. 

Her head bobbed in a steady rhythm until he cupped her chin in a strong hand. "No more. Stop!" He breathed raggedly. "Lets make it last. We have the whole night ahead of us. You're such a hungry slut." He told her. 

"Yes, master." She said reluctantly. In frustration she sank back to kneel on the floor at his feet. She wanted him desperately and knew she would eventually, only she wanted him now. 'I'm your slut and I want it now.' She thought. 

At that moment she remembered the neighbour that morning telling her she was a slut. She gave a little shiver of fear. This evening Jim too had told her she was a slut. Had he unintentionally reinforced that awful mans words to make it a stronger command. Had Jim called her a slut because she was behaving like one? If she was, then it had already started to be programmed into her mind. She would have to warn Jim of this danger when he released her later. 

Angus had only ever commanded her to dress up for him leaving the suggestion planted in her mind that she must wear more alluring clothing. She had been happy with that as it improved their love life and their marriage. She had learnt to go along with it all even enjoying being commanded and dominated. 

She wondered how much of all this was what she wanted and how much her mind had been changed over time. 

"Come on maid it's getting late. Time for bed." He told her. 

Woken from her reverie she quickly jumped up startled; still anxious over thoughts of what was happening to her. 

"You seem very eager, maid. Perhaps I shouldn't call you that but something more appropriate. You're such an eager slut this evening. So, that's it then. Slut. You're my eager little slut. The way you were sucking me I should call you my cock slut." 

"Are you my cock slut?" He asked. 

"Yes master. I'm your cock slut." She acknowledged. 

With him following her up the stairs she felt his eyes on her panties, right between her legs. Excited at the prospect of at last having him she forgot all about what she was to be called or that it would become a part of her. It no longer mattered; rather it felt exciting to be his cock slut.

Melody was feeling very satisfied with how things had turned out. It was Friday and for the whole week she had pleased her master and herself too. There had been no trouble from the nasty neighbour and so they had been left to themselves to play the wonderful naughty games. 

She preened her long dark hair in the mirror teasing it into shape. There was no hurry as her master had specified not to prepare a meal. Smoothing down the light summer dress she turned from side to side checking the suspenders didn't show. It fit her body tight then flared out from her hips. If it were windy she would have to be careful, as it was too short to be wearing such audacious underwear. 

This was a legacy from Angus but Jim liked her to wear stockings and suspenders too. He would be home soon and the thought gave her a little thrill as she wondered what was in store for tonight. 

"Hi Melody! Have you had a good day?" He asked. 

"Just the usual. So what have you got planned for tonight?" She couldn't help asking. 

"I thought I'd go out for a meal care to join me? You deserve a break from looking after me. It'll make Angus happy too if I put it down on expenses." He laughed. 

"Oh! I nearly forgot. Here's a card from him. He's not one to write much." 

"So he's having a good time, not regretting it. I get a mention too. Well, am I looking after you?" He smiled. Jim wondered again how much of this Angus had planned. If he had given him his wife to look after then so be it. 

She demurred looking down at the carpet knowing exactly what he meant. She flashed him a smile and asked. "Where are we going? Somewhere expensive I hope." 

*** 

The restaurant wasn't quit what she had expected. Not in a part of town she knew and from the outside it didn't look much. It was a pleasant surprise inside though. Cubicles with low lighting gave it a sense of privacy and the menu looked impressive too. She noticed a piano playing in the corner a nice change from canned drivel. It was a romantic hideaway despite being busy. 

The waiter was discreet obviously used to businessmen bring secretaries or floozies on a seductive interlude. After ordering their drinks she looked down at her dress knowing he had been checking her out. Pulling down its hem to cover the stocking tops was not an option for the top was too low. Her nipples nearly popped out. Wriggling to pull it back up flashed the suspenders. She gave up reasoning the waiter probably thought she was just another woman on the make anyway. 

It gave her a little thrill knowing she was here in this salubrious place with a young lover. It must be having an effect on him too for he was paying her a lot of attention. She felt his hand slide up the outside of her thigh under the table. "Hey what are you doing?" She said. 

"Sorry. Was that your leg?" He responded with mock surprise. 

"I'm your landlady remember, young man." She told him. She was amused at the disappointed look upon his face. He knew she remembered everything he had done to her while hypnotised but she wasn't now. She had made it clear the two states would be kept completely separate. 

The wine was delicious; a dark Bordeaux full of flavours that roamed the palate. 

"The ladies restroom is through there round the corner." He said. She looked quizzically at him wondering why he had interrupted the conversation. Then he uttered the phrase. She sat, arms to her sides, with a misty look in her eyes. "You will talk normally but continue to obey as usual." He told her. 

"Go to the restroom and remove your panties and do whatever else you have to do while there. When you return put your panties on the table." He stated, with a grin on his face. 

"Oh! No, not here." She said, in a whisper. A look of surprise crossed her face as she realised she had protested out loud rather than the usual silent thought. Rising from the seat she continued. "Jim, please. Not in public. This is too dangerous." 

"Why? Are you in the habit of allowing strangers to feel you up in restaurants? If someone asks to see your underwear then so be it. Your panties will be in your hand. Don't worry. No one will know, but I will." He grinned. 

She wished she had kept her mouth shut for he was only making it worse. It was true no one would know but him, nevertheless she was terribly nervous making her way past booths and tables in the packed restaurant. She would never have worn such a light dress without a slip before Angus had worked upon her. It was far too immodest. 

She relaxed a little in the restroom surprised to find it clean and tidy. Obviously fitted out with the entertained women in mind; a clever ploy by management. Taking a deep breath she left the cubicle, knickers in hand. There was another woman there applying make-up to an already over done face. 

In consternation she realised she would have to put down her clutch bag with her panties to wash her hands. The woman looked down at her panties sitting beside the sink with a smirk across her face. "I hope he's rich and more forthcoming than mine. Anyway, the richer they are the more they want to hold on to it." She almost spat. 

Melody looked appalled at the inference. "Come on, don't be like that. You're just as much a slut as I am. I don't pretend any different. Mind you I wouldn't strip my knickers off here however rich he was. I don't like being interfered with under the table. I like a nice warm bed." 

There it was again. She was being told she was a slut. She couldn't seem to deny it either. "Let me tell you. Show them what they want to see, tell them what they want to hear but don't give them all they want. Leave them wanting more." The woman grimaced. 

Before the woman said much more she decided to get back to Jim. Hurrying out she walked straight into a man leaving the opposite rest room. He steadied her by the hips while she wobbled in the high heels. 

"Sorry." She apologised. 

Standing back he admired her silhouette. "Nice dress." He said. 

"Thanks." She replied. There was no way around the big man and she didn't want to get into a conversation with any more strangers it felt too daunting. 

"Did I feel a suspender belt? Are, yes. I can see the outline of the suspenders. Very nice." He said. 

She dropped her bag and was appalled to see the panties float to the floor. When he picked them up she felt her heart racing. This was so humiliating she wanted to push past him to run out to the car. She didn't move. She realised her orders were to return to the table with the panties in her hand. "Could I have my panties back please?" She whispered. 

"I've always been a fan of stockings. The proper ones not those elasticised things, stay ups are they called? If you want them back show me your stockings" He looked at her with an assured look of someone used to getting his own way.  

===

"Not here. It's too embarrassing." She was about to say she was no slut but the word just couldn't be said. Was it that she couldn't deny what she had become? Her hands went to the hem of the dress obeying the command. She looked around in panic but thankfully there was no one to see her shame. She couldn't say anything to prevent what he ordered so kept her mouth shut. 

He looked down at her legs encased in the sheer silk stockings that Angus had bought her. "Higher. I want to see the suspenders." He told her. "The lights better in here. Follow me." 

In fear she followed him into the men's rest room still holding the dress up around her thighs. "That's better. So what is the suspender belt like? I want to see that too." He said, while dangling her panties from his fingers. 

It was useless to protest so she let her hands be commanded without resistance. With the dress around her waist he could see everything. In the mirror behind her he could even see her bare bottom. With her legs pressed tight together she could feel her swollen lips protruding. All this was turning her on despite trying to ignore it. Her body was behaving like the slut she had been told she was. 

She looked at the bulge in his trousers and licked her lips. Silently she cursed herself. She was playing up to him. Damn it! She couldn't help it. She was beginning to entice him on. 

"You're such a little slut. I think you aught to finish what you started. You look as though you want to. In fact I insist. Get down on your knees and give me a blow job." The stranger told her. 

Melody stood stunned with her dress up around her waist. She knew this order couldn't be refused and she couldn't think what to say to convince him to change it. At that moment the door burst open. Melody looked at the woman she had been talking to in the ladies restroom and froze. 

"What the hell are you doing? Give me those." The woman grabbed the panties from his hand and shoved him toward the door. The big man shrugged and walked out. 

Melody thought for a moment she was going to have to follow him to complete the command. Would she actually crawl under the table in the restaurant, before everyone, to suck that stranger's cock? She began to breath heavily from the effort of resisting the urge to follow him. 

"Damn! I was wrong. You're a bigger slut than me. I'm a saint compared to you, taking tricks in a restroom. He's mine so leave him alone. Do you hear?" The woman told her. 

Still breathing heavily melody nodded. It was such a relief to be told to leave the man alone that she smiled. 

"You look as though you needed it. Well here take this slut." She said. The woman waved a vibrator in her face. The woman used the word as an insult in contrast to before when it was meant as a sisterhood thing. 

Melody just stood there holding onto her dress dazed at what had happened or rather what very nearly happened. 

The woman clicked her tongue. "You had better use this to calm yourself down." She told her. The woman turned away toward the door. 

In disgust Melody took the thing and eased into her body. She hoped it hadn't been anywhere infectious. From the doorway the woman told her. "The coast is clear. We had better get out of here. The management takes a dim view of women working in here. Get back to your table and don't hassle my man. You hear?" 

Melody was used to the high heels but wearing a vibrator almost pushed her over the edge. She tottered back to the table still bewildered and eased her abused body onto the seat. 

"You were a long time. What do you women get up to in there?" 

Melody was appalled. She couldn't bear thinking about it let alone telling him what she had just been through. 

"Don't bother. There should always be some mysteries in life." 

The starters arrived and as good as the plate looked she felt her hunger had vanished. All she could think of was the damn thing wriggling inside every time she moved. The waiter had seen her panties on the table but made no comment. If she hadn't been so distracted she would have cringed every time he came near the table. 

She wanted to ask Jim if she could go to the restroom but was afraid of what might happen if she met someone. Somehow she was going to have to get rid of the damn torture weapon embedded in her. Jim was make inroads up her thighs, parting her legs intending to tease her. If he found that thing he would ask questions and she didn't want to answer them. 

Jim excused himself. At last! She parted her legs to enthusiastically delve between them. Pulling the slippery object free it fell to the floor. On queue the waiter returned to clear away the empty plates. He trod on it and picked it up. "Yours madam?" He said, without a trace of emotion upon his face. 

"No." She said. It was the truth as that was all she could say while hypnotised. 

She watched him place it with disdain upon an empty plate. In dismay she watched him nudge the panties onto the same plate with exaggerated care. The humiliation prevented her speaking. She just couldn't bring herself to tell him to leave her panties on the table. 

Although this was a small thing compared to what had just happened but it affected her just as badly. In this seemingly normal situation she was being judged by a waiter and found guilty of being a depraved slut. What was so awful was that he was right. She was acting like a depraved slut so then she must be. 

Jim returned and asked. "Where are you panties? You haven't put them back on have you?" 

"No. The waiter took them away." She murmured. 

"Shall I ask him to bring them back?" He laughed. 

"No please don't. I don't need them." 

"Well that's an interesting turn around. In future you won't be wearing any unless I tell you to. That's an order." 

She groaned wondering why she had let this terrible situation develop. Resignedly she opened her legs to let him explore. It was giving him a thrill to stroke her, in the restaurant. Surprisingly she wondered at how wet she was; so turned on she was prepared to beg him to take her home right now. She thought to herself. 'I'm just a slut ready for anything.'

Chapter 06 

Melody and Jim visit a Casino 

The taxi ride home from the restaurant had been terribly frustrating because she wanted him but couldn't do a thing about it. She couldn't face telling him she had very nearly given a stranger a blow job in the restaurant as it would be just so degrading. Yet the narrow escape had left her feeling so aroused she desperately needed him. 

It was difficult to tell whether the terribly naughty incident was firing her up or she was behaving like a slut. Melody had been told too many times she was a slut while under the influence of hypnosis that it was taking a hold of her. If she asked Jim to try and break this shameful state she might have to tell him what happened with that stranger. She simply couldn't face that. 

Melody was thankful she had been ordered to speak normally as usually she was unable to utter a word except in response to her young master. As soon as they got through the front door she was at last able to tell him what she wanted although still hypnotised. "Jim, please, I need you." She blurted out. It was shameful but it was impossible to hold back. "Your slut needs you so badly." 

He grabbed a hold of her bottom in both hands to pull her close and kiss her deeply. He was no longer looking after her for her husband or just for convenient sex he had fallen in love, even if this moment was driven by lust. While exploring her mouth with his tongue they tore each others clothes off. At the foot of the stairs he dragged her down where in a tangle of clothes and limbs they copulated like wild animals. 

She yanked the crotch of her panties aside and took hold of his rock hard penis. There was no need for foreplay he simply sank into her yielding flesh piercing her roughly. She pulled her legs up wrapping them around his waist, bucking up at him in a frenzy of passion. The sounds were feral guttural grunts and groans meaning nothing but reflecting the wild passion of their thrusts. 

They both knew each others bodies so well the climax was synchronised unconsciously with none of the gentle play of young lovers. This was the red hot heat of madness driven by a hunger for an orgasm. This was the true meaning of being turned on, with only a one way switch. 

Melody gripped hard as though squeezing every last drop of passion from his body, needing it to fulfil a burning desire. He had succeeded as she knew he would. She felt him filling her with his seed of life and felt reborn. A glorious glow of satisfaction began to develop into a delirious happiness. 

Jim felt spent, deflating upon her body sinking into it wanting her soft flesh to engulf him. He nuzzled her breasts knowing they would be sensitive so licked them and sucked them gently. The wild beast had trotted away leaving behind a human compassion caring more for her than his own life. 

Hand in hand they stumbled up the stairs to shower where they soaped and caressed their tired bodies. He patted her body dry and in turn she towelled him, not wanting to be parted in the after glow of an emotional togetherness more magnetic than sex. 

Cuddling in bed like innocents they murmured sweet words to each other until the seriousness of sex subsided enough for them to laugh. "I want to lick and blow into your ears. Your cute nose is so kissable. Your full lips are so biteable. You are so delicious I want to eat you up. Terramazoo." He whispered in her ear. 

"What?" She giggled feeling young and alive as though rejuvenated from an injection of his youthful sperm. 

"It's an Italian desert." He said. 

"I know but what does it mean?" 

"I love you more than my favourite desert." 

She laughed but the little word sobered her. She was a married woman and that word reminded her that she had broken a sacred promise to be faithful to one man. She had worked out Angus had set up this arrangement so he could escape to fulfil an ambition. The death of his mother had driven him into thinking this might be his last chance when the opportunity arose with Jim turning up. 

She still felt guilty and it showed on her face. In case he saw the pain she drew his head to her breast not wanting him to ask questions. At that moment she realised he must have said the phrase earlier to release her from the hypnotic state. They had made love without her being hypnotised which confirmed how carried away she had been as well as how emotionally attached she had become. 

This would have to stop. Angus would return some day soon. They had never had such a passionate love life, even when young newly married lovers. Perhaps each of them had been too concerned with their own needs as an only child often is. Inexperience then habit born from years together had drained the passion from their lives. 

Tears formed in her eyes and dropped upon his cheek. Jim looked up into her face seeing sorrow there. "What's wrong?" He asked, his voice laden with concern. 

"Just tears of happiness lover." She lied. 

Jim didn't believe her but said nothing. Instead he buried his head between her breasts. When he said no more she guessed he was thinking the same thing. This thing they had was on a time limit with neither wanting it to expire. 

*** 

Melody left him sleeping in the guest bedroom for they never shared the master bedroom. Next morning she arose early to go shopping. She wondered the aisles in the usual pattern lifting cans and packets without seeing them, just dropping them into the cart. 

She reasoned you could love both parents equally and if there had been siblings every one of them would share her affection. If they had been lucky enough to have children they would be different yet equally adored. So could she love two men? Had Angus thought this through or just escaped to fulfil a selfish ambition. Angus was her rock in life yet this young man was exciting leaving her feeling fulfilled, or was it just the sex? 

Not wanting to agonise over the dilemma any longer she drove home. Hearing Jim in the shower she prepared lunch. Managing to keep her distance was difficult but he picked up on her mood and gave her space. So now she knew what that meant. It was as though they were a married couple settling into a routine. That evening they slept in separate rooms and behaved like respectable landlady and tenant. 

Sunday evening came round after what seemed an age of quietness. Washing up the dinner plates she jumped on feeling his arms snake around her waist. He whispered in her ear, the words not heard, the sensation enough to know what was meant. She shivered at the feel of his lips on her neck producing goose bumps on her arms. 

The delicious attention couldn't be passively accepted for long. "If you wanted more to eat you should have told me. I'm not a very good landlady if I'm not providing what you want." She giggled. "I guess I'll just have to be your desert, if you think I'm good enough to eat." She teased. 

"Oh! You just can't help yourself young man, you have to ask properly. You know what to say." She stated trying to sound like a respectable landlady. She heard the words that released her inhibitions and assuaged the guilt. Melody was no longer able to decide anything for she was under the control of this young virile man. 

She stood placidly, hands to her sides, with soapsuds dripping onto the floor. He led her into the lounge and asked. "It all started here. That first night what did you think?" 

"I was shocked. It was terribly embarrassing, yet you excited me so much." She stated knowing everything would have to be said however revealing. 

"Since then we have." He faltered from embarrassment. "Come a long way, experienced a lot. I think we should make the most of it while we can. Do you want to?" He asked mildly but with a desperate hope she too wanted to carry on. 

"Yes!" She exclaimed, surprised at the depth of feeling expressed in that one word. 

"On the floor then, I want my desert; I'm going to eat you all up." He laughed with relief. Jim crawled over to her lifting the modest skirt just above her knees and kissed them. He lifted her legs and licked behind the knees sending a tremor to her feet. One shoe fell off and he licked her toes and stroked the soles of her feet. With legs now parted he caressed the inside of both legs with tongue and finger tips. 

Crawling between her open legs he nosed her inner thighs. Her wide open eyes stared at everything he did not wanting to just feel it she wanted to take it all in, to absorb every sensation. 

"You aren't wearing panties, as ordered." He smiled. 

Melody hadn't even noticed. This morning she had dressed and went shopping wearing these modest clothes yet so daringly without panties. His order not to wear them had permeated her mind even when not hypnotised and it was thrilling to be so helplessly under his spell. 

She watched and felt intensely the stroke of fingers and the gentle nips of lips and teeth mark a progress up her thighs. She lifted her hips for him to push the skirt up above her waist where he kissed her bellybutton. He paid attention to the slight bulge of her stomach when all the time she waited and craved for the intensity of a lower more delicate place to be devoured. 

"You have kept this treasure well shaved." He smiled into her eyes. 

She gasped from the intensity of the feeling when he kissed her lips. The sound was also motivated from the illicit naughtiness of shaving her pussy for him. Unable to stand it any longer she lay back flat upon the floor like a rag doll letting him do what ever he liked with her body. 

A single intense idea shook her, that it wasn't her pussy any longer it was his. She kept it cleanly shaved, panty-less and ready for whenever he wanted it. 'I'm just a slut for ever ready for him to use.' She thought. 

A powerful orgasm overcame her body swamping her mind with feelings wiping away thoughts leaving her sated. She groaned out load but did not move. Her legs were either side of his shoulders as if he were burrowing in like an over ambitious caver. 

She had offered herself as the after dinner desert and he was making the most of it. He lapped at her pussy pulling upon her lips, nibbling on them. She wanted to lift her head to watch the erotic sight as well as experience the sensational feel of it but couldn't move. She knew what he intended, he was going to eat her until there was nothing left. 

A finger pressed against her bottom and her little hole gave way. She felt a delicate touch in both once private places, sensitising them for more to come. His tongue lapped at her nub pushing her once more toward an orgasm. A finger touched the 'G' spot and she flinched. Her legs wrapped around his head and her stomach tightened for another deep orgasm. 

Relentlessly he used his tongue, his nose, fingers and lips upon her body. Her pussy, asshole and breasts became so sensitised she hardly needed touching before an orgasm rushed over her like a wave breaking across the sands. A continuous whimper was breathed between her lips, in and out like the surf on a moonlight beach. 

She lost count of how many orgasms shook then stroked her body but when at last he had eaten his fill she lay there almost unconscious in a deliriously happy state. He helped her up to bed and cuddled her until she slumped into a peaceful sleep. 

It hadn't been his intention to trick or force her into continuing their games but to show how much he cared, without using words. 

The rest of the week they shared the pleasure of love making, in the lounge, in the kitchen, and in bed. Each time they had committed an intense marathon, as enjoyable as ever and more so, with cuddles shared and whispered love notes. 

*** 

Friday came around and Jim arranged an evening out. "Well at least this time I won't be embarrassed with my panties on the table for all to see. I don't wear them now!" She giggled. Melody twirled the figure hugging red silk dress Jim had bought for her. Her figure wasn't so slim at her age but more voluptuous and enticing which pleased her young lover leaving her feeling delighted. 

"It's so lovely." She cooed. 

"When you do that it shows off the cheeks of that cute bottom. It's so gorgeous it should be shown off." He laughed. On seeing her face redden in embarrassment he told her. "Go up stairs and put on some panties you silly slut." He said with a devilish glint to his eye. 

She climbed the stairs with a wiggle to her hips knowing he was watching every move. Only a short time ago she would have been disgusted being referred to as a slut and as far as having to be told to put on panties, she would have died of shame. Showing off her body to a young man, letting him look up her dress would have been impossible. 

With a light heart she joined him all ready to go. "Show me." She didn't need to ask what he meant she just lifted the dress to display a pair of lacy red panties. She was too pleased at his concern to feel embarrassed rather she felt he was looking after her. It was a little strange standing there with the dress held around her hips showing off her panties but then since meeting him her whole life had been turned upside down. 

Melody didn't ask where they were off too it didn't matter so as long as they were together. In the car they swapped records, each playing a favourite track, switching genres from the Beatles through upbeat jazz to northern soul. A wrong track selection brought on a sentimental country and western which they both laughed at on realising it had been a mistake. 

"Have you ever been to a Casino?" He asked. They drove passed the entrance toward the parking area and the sheer brilliance of glittering bulbs and neon signs took Melody's excited her. Angus would never have visited this palace of fun deeming it a trivial waste of money. This occurred to her as they parked up and made their way across acres of concrete but she didn't care. 

Walking in Melody was assaulted by a cacophony of noise from bouncing coins on shiny metal troughs. The sheer size and splendour of the Casino took her breath away. Looking from machine to machine like a child's first visit to a sweet shop she was hooked. 

They played the slots dropping coins by the bucket full. "I've run out, I don't know how much money I've just thrown away." She laughed, knowing her husband would have disapproved and not caring, finding it all the more exciting. 

"Not much, they're only quarters. Let's play roulette. Remember that film Casino Royal, well I'll be James Bond and you can be Pussy Galore." Jim teased. 

He may have mixed the films but the audacity of him using that word in front of all those people excited her. "I'm your slutty pussy." She teased back at him. 

"You look it in that red dress." He told her. She blushed, not quite matching the dress. They crowded in among a raucous group of players straining to see the table. He told her the rules and how simple it was. "Just bet low and you will lose slowly." 

"I thought I was supposed to win." She stated, with a guileless look. 

He laughed at the innocence of the expression and statement. "Maybe you are, but I just do it for the buzz and hope not to lose too much. Here jump on that stool and have a go." The pile of chips grew and he wondered if it was beginners luck or the fates really did mean her to win. Every time she lost a larger win followed. 

They took a rest and she asked. "How come I've just got this handful of chips?" 

"They swapped them for high value ones. You can cash them in or we can play something else." He said. 

He didn't look so pleased having lost his stake. She wanted to cheer him up. A young waitress wearing a tight low cut top and high cut around the hips took their order. He eyed her leaving Melody feeling jealous and more determined to please. "You could get me to remove my panties before we saunter back to the car." She said to him with a mischievous grin. 

She looked around at all the busy people reckoning no one would notice for they were too busy watching their money tumble away. 

"So you want to go home to something important you need to do?" He asked, perking up at the suggestion. Remembering the frenzied sex of last Friday he readily agreed. 

She heard the words whispered in her ear and stood there as though mesmerised by the wild sounds and lights of the casino. "Act naturally but remember to obey. You must be carful to do as you're told." He ordered her. 

She noticed he had omitted to say 'obey me'. It was too late now to do anything about it but she would warn him for next time. In any case he was waiting for her outside the restroom and would protectively hold on to her all the time. She felt so shy in front of these people wearing the little red dress without panties. 

Anywhere else and the colour alone would attract attention. If the hem bounced up the red suspenders would hardly notice she reasoned. They had a long walk back to the parking lot through the whole length of the casino. She felt a little buzz of excitement knowing any one of these people could command her if they knew how helpless she was. 

"Hi Jim, how are you doing? I didn't know you came to casinos." 

"Hello Ronny, this is Melody a friend. Yea, I like to play cards, can't stand the slots." Jim said. Melody nodded and smiled. 

"There's a game about to start, I've been looking forward to it why don't you join us, at least take a look. What do you say, Melody, do you like to play cards?" Ronny said with hand on her arm. 

Jim could see how wound up he was and couldn't just push him away from Melody. "OK. Let's take a look at this game. It's on our way." He said, protectively taking a hold of Melody so the guy let go of her arm. 

Only players were allowed into the roped off area where a few poker tables were about to start. Melody could see on his face a look of longing. He wasn't addicted but did like the friendly banter and tension of a game. 

"Here take these." Melody pushed the chips into his hands. She was still hypnotised but could act naturally unless ordered to do something. She wanted to see him enjoy himself. 

"I can't leave you out here." He started to say, but Ronny interrupted. 

"Looks to me you've been given permission to play by the pretty woman. You go and enjoy the roulette until were finished." Ronny told her. 

The white rope was clipped shut with Jim standing watching her disappear into the crowd. For a moment he wanted to follow her but Ronny pulled him to a table where the last two seats were waiting for them. He looked up to where she had disappeared reasoning he had told her to act natural so she should be alright. She had given him most of the chips without prompting so she was able to act on her own initiative. 

There were so many security guards around she would be safe. Still he worried. 

*** 

Melody hadn't noticed this was a high stakes table and quickly lost the remaining chips and wondered what to do next. Ronny hadn't meant to give her an order but she was stuck playing roulette until they finished playing cards. It was so annoying to be caught out like this she would have to tell Jim to tell her to obey only him in future. 

The croupier looked at her meaningfully and thankfully she wasn't completely helpless so asked him. "Can I play with a credit card?" He shook his head but a pit boss looked her over and glanced at the card. Distracted by her thighs and stocking tops he merely glanced at the card. Mistaking it for a casino card he gave the go ahead before turning to another table where the crowd was becoming too boisterous. 

The croupier pushed over a stack of high value chips. She still thought they were five dollar chips and bet accordingly with the stack building and falling until there was nothing left. The pit boss had more time now to take a good look at the card. He blanched and knew he was in trouble. He called the manager over and whispered in his ear. They looked at her and the manager talked into his sleeve. Within a minute a smartly suited man stood beside Melody.  

===

"I need to talk to you for a moment. Come this way." He took a hold of her elbow and steered her to a door marked 'staff only'. It was an order to follow him so there was no chance to decline. Melody figured that was the end of her credit and they would process the card. 

In a plush office she was greeted by another smart suited man seated behind a large desk. There was nothing on it except a leather bound blotter pad and she wondered if anyone used real ink pens anymore. He didn't look like a clerk, more like a senior executive. 

"There seems to be a misunderstanding, may I look at that credit car." He said without introducing himself. 

Melody fished it out of her purse and passed it to him. This man too spoke with quiet authority. "Do you have another method of paying for your loss?" 

When he mentioned the figure she felt weak. A chair was produced pushing at her legs and she thankfully sank onto it. She looked up at the big man still standing by her then at the man who held the credit card and felt a fool. It was like being brought before the headmaster only more intimidating. 

The conversation was a little one sided while she either nodded or shook her head in confusion. "Of course you do not want anyone to know of this, I am sure it would be embarrassing for you. We can be very discreet. What you owe must be paid or we lose our reputation so no exceptions are ever made. As your husband owns the house and you do not work there seems to be only one option. You will work here until the debt has been repaid." 

Melody simply nodded. The words he used, the tone of voice, all added up to an order, though she would have no option but agree. She stood as ordered and in dismay lifted the hem of the dress to show him her legs. He nodded a dispassionate approval making no comment on the red suspenders. 

She felt humiliated lifting her dress in this office before strangers. As he said there were many jobs in a casino but she lacked qualifications and checking her body over was necessary. She didn't know if it was the act of lifting the dress or his dismissal was more humiliating. She didn't look forward to being dressed in a waitresses outfit walking around the casino showing off her body to strangers either. 

She hadn't noticed the other man leave or the woman glide in. 

"Take Melody to the staff room and acquaint her with the rules. You can take her under your wing until she learns her duties." He said. 

It seemed they were dismissed for without another word the woman guided her back out of the office. Further along the corridor they entered the bowels of the casino with its bare walls and myriad of corridors. 

"I guess it's a bit of a shock to be so suddenly brought from casino guest to worker." The woman smirked. "At least with a body like that you won't be scrubbing floors. By the way, my names Shirley and I'm your boss. You've been assigned to the private high roller tables so no one you know will see you working here." She smirked again. 

Melody was being judged by the cost of her clothes and found to be wanting. In the changing room Melody was assigned a locker and given a towel for a shower. Forgetting she had removed her panties she slipped the dress over her head. 

"So! You're a bit of a slut then. I didn't put you down as one, well you won't be alone here we have all sorts." 

Melody felt angry and humiliated but didn't know what to say. It was bad enough stripping off in front of a stranger and yet again she had been called a slut and with good reason. She quickly pulled her clothes off and threw them into the locker. 

Fresh from the shower she found an outfit hanging on the door of the locker. Shirley had at least judged her measurements correctly. It was a surprise that this was different from the skimpy outfits she had seen the waitresses wear. 

This was a bustier designed to push her breasts up and out so they balanced on top like an offering. She hooked the stockings to the belts hanging from it and pulled up a thong glad to be wearing panties again. Melody hoped the dress wasn't too short, not wanting to show her bottom off to strangers. 

Again Shirley appeared without warning. "Ok. Let's get the rest of your things and we can get started. I don't bother with the rules you can learn on the job. Of course the one important one is no touching. They can't touch you and you can't touch them, if you know what I mean." She laughed. 

Melody hoped they didn't run into anyone before she got the rest of the uniform. They pushed through a swing door and Melody stopped dead. "Now don't freeze on me Melody. You will do as you're told and that's an order, you understand?" She watched Melody nod her head and relaxed. 

'So this is it, no dress.' Melody cringed. 'I'm to serve these strangers with my breasts and bottom on show. Why the hell did she have to say it's an 'order'? It would have been better if she had said obey 'me', but she didn't.' 

"Here are your things, tray, note pad and pen." Shirley told her. "Follow me around for a few tables I'm sure you'll pick up the routine quick enough." She said. 

Melody followed Shirley around like a lost puppy. As supervisor she at least had a dress to wear, although short and low cut, it was still more decent than just a small corset. 

With relief Melody realised the men were more interested in the cards than her. As a new girl Shirley had given her a card table with quiet older men playing cards rather than a crowded noisy crap table. She also noticed her boss fluttered round swooping in to ward off any trouble. 

Still she wasn't feeling too confident as unlike the others she was hypnotised ready to obey. She had been stripped of her panties, money, and pride then dressed up like a slut. Still so very vulnerable she was serving strangers with her breasts and bottom on show. Inside she giggled at the situation thinking it was better then crying. She was a slut on heat showing her body off to strangers and there wasn't much she could do about it. 

At least here she was relatively safe, unless someone gave her an order, and even then they couldn't touch her. She felt a warm glow inside from the idea of being an untouchable teasing slut on show to a crowd of rich strangers. It was daunting yet fascinating to feel so aroused.

Jim took a break with Ronny wittering away about how lucky they were to have picked the right table. "They have more money than sense." 

"I should go and see if Melody is alright." Jim said. 

"You can't leave now! We are up and looking good. We can clean up here Jim." He protested. 

Against his better judgement he let his friend persuade him to stay. The game eventually ground to a halt with Jim just ahead of his friend but well up on his original stake. He should have felt good from winning but quickly left to find Melody. He felt guilty as he toured the tables looking for her but it soon turned to panic when he couldn't find her. 

He phoned home, no answer. He backtracked through the casino with still no sign of her. He was walking fast trying not to run wondering what he should do, wondering how deeply embedded the hypnotic state was. A woman walked out of a restroom and he asked if a woman wearing a red dress was in there. 

"No dice honey. You look as though you lost a packet so maybe you shouldn't find her, just go home." The woman advised. 

There was only one thing for it. He toured the roulette tables hoping not to be too conspicuous or a nuisance not wanting to be chucked out. He leaned over the rail and asked for the pit boss. Eventually he hit the right table. 

"Yea I saw her. She tried to trick me into approving a dud credit card. Go ask at customer services they will know what happened." He said, relating his own version of events. 

At least he was making progress tracking her down. When a security guard looked at him he slowed his pace. He must look a state, out of breath and sweating with anxiety. 

"Is there some trouble here?" The same guard asked. He stood tall in an impressive uniform with a look that said don't mess with me. Jim realised his voice had grown loud with frustration. 

"He wants to know what happened to his girlfriend. Seems a nice enough feller, wish I had someone like that to look after me." The information assistant said with a smile at the guard. 

"Sorry, didn't mean to. . . I'm concerned for her, that's all." Jim said. 

"I told him I can't reveal information about a guest, it's confidential. Jones, maybe you could have a word with him, help the guy out." She said with a wink. 

"Anything for you sweet-heart." Jones replied, now looking more cute than fierce. 

Jim smiled a warm thank you to the woman. Once more he was on the trail. He explained what happened leaving out her state of vulnerability. While they talked Jones drew them to a relatively quiet corner. 

"I can't tell you anything either." He said flatly. He held up a hand to Jim's chest cutting off the protest. He buzzed the radio and spoke into it. "Hi Jake. You catching overtime or escaping that woman of yours? Sure, I know. Do you know anything about a Melody in a red dress, played roulette and lost. Yea, don't they all sooner or later. You'll have to speak up I can't hear out here." 

Jones held the radio between them and Jim smiled. The radio was hard to hear but the information was vital, holding his attention. "It's in the log. Owes big time, Dan the Man interviewed her and she ended up serving the big hitters. What's your interest big guy?" The voice crackled. 

"Nothing for now, keep me posted. That's one off the list you owe me." Jones said and signed off. "As I said can't tell you anything about a player but it looks like she's staff now. No can do either way." He shrugged. 

"Thanks for that anyway. How do I get into the 'big hitters' place and what is it?" Jim asked. 

Jones looked him up and down and shook his head. "You don't. They are very particular about that little club. You could wait for her to finish the shift. I'm going for a coffee you could tag along if you want." He said looking Jim in the eyes. 

Jim was catching on to the way this big man operated and nodded. He was being led to the right place he just hoped it would be the right time. They passed the information desk and he leaned in close to the woman. "He's a nice guy I could see him looking after you just right." He noticed her blush and hurried to catch up with Jones. 

"Thanks for your help." 

"Never said a thing." Jones stated. 

"Thanks for the coffee then." 

"Thanks for the word with the lovely lady." 

"Never said anything" Jim stated. He watched Jones wide shoulders shake with laughter, the only sign of amusement the man revealed. 

"When I get off shift I come through that door to the elevators down to the car park. They were too cheap to install a staff elevator. There will be a change of waitresses in about an hour. Don't drink too much coffee." Jones said and lifted his large frame out of the seat to saunter off on his rounds of the casino. 

*** 

Melody felt so embarrassed leaning over the table depositing drinks with her breasts almost grazing the cheek of each player. If it was a ploy by management to distract them it wasn't working for they ignored her. She stood waiting somewhat relieved yet disappointed at the lack of attention. Was she too old for this? 

The players agreed on a break and stretched, looking about them blinking like miners emerging from a coal face. "Well you are certainly a sight lot better than the usual skinny girls they have around here." One of them said looking her up and down. She stood straighter as a reaction to the murmur of agreement rippling around the table unintentionally thrusting out both breasts. 

"You can take my order young lady." He said. 

She nervously stepped on high heels close beside him aware of their close scrutiny. Melody wanted to throw the pen and pad onto the table freeing her hands to cover her breasts but this wasn't an option. Besides, he had used that dreaded word, 'order'. 

His hand slid over a bare bottom stroking it lightly as he looked round the table confirming the drinks and snacks with each of the players. Melody looked across the room, imploring with her eyes for help from Shirley, only the supervisor was busy and if she looked this way there was nothing to see. "Let me have a look at that list just make sure you have it right." He said, still stroking her bottom. 

She wanted to step back to the waitress station away from this strangers hand but it seemed she was under his orders and would have to suffer in silence. Bending over him with the notepad her breast stroked his cheek and the laughter of the others left her feeling ill used for it was obvious they knew exactly what he was doing. 

Bent over going through the list his hand slid between her cheeks and nudged her asshole protected only by the thong. A fingernail scratched the material pursing her pussy eliciting a light moan. There was no laughter this time as they became intent on avoiding attention from her supervisor. 

"Your handwriting is rather good for a waitress, what do you do when not working here?" He asked. 

"I. I'm just a housewife." She said with difficulty. A finger and thumb were twisting into the cotton of the thong pushing at her sex and asshole with the inevitable result. Despite her best efforts he was arousing her into becoming the hot slut she had been led to believe she was. It was as though she had been programmed to think of herself as a slut; worse than that she was behaving like a willing slut ready for anyone. 

"You could never be just a housewife with such a delicious figure my dear. What else are you?" He asked quietly. 

"I'm a slut, sir." She whispered. The words hadn't been selected they emerged from her mouth as though she were a doll and he had pressed a button. He was pressing the right buttons now as he found her swollen bud between the open folds of her pussy which he rubbed and teased. 

Melody nearly collapsed on hearing the dreadful words uttered. It was all the more humiliating knowing it was true. She was allowing a complete stranger to excite her in front of his friends and they were keenly watching every moment of her torment. Were they waiting to see how far he could push her or waiting their turn to abuse her body. 

"You will have to speak up us oldies are hard of hearing." He smiled. 

She felt his fingers push hard into her with the dreadful awareness there had been no resistance as she was so wet and open. His timing was devastating for she had opened her mouth to repeat the awful truth as his fingers prodded her. With an outrush of breathe she whimpered loud enough for them all to hear. "I'm a slut, sir." 

"Am I keeping you waiting?" He asked with a devilish grin upon his face. 

"Yes, yes, sir." She breathed heavily. His fingers were exploring her innermost secrets before his friends in a room full of people. She wanted him to suck on her breast so close to his mouth she could feel his breath teasing a nipple. The slut needed to cum. 

"What are you waiting for then, slut?" He asked, with amusement tuning his voice. 

Melody didn't want to answer knowing only too well the question must be answered however disgraceful it was. "I'm waiting to cum, sir. Please make me cum." She whimpered still under orders to speak up, imagining everyone in the room could hear the disgraceful words. Begging a stranger to give her an orgasm was degrading beyond anything she had ever experienced and there were so many witnesses to her downfall. 

He rubbed hard and fast still able to keep a passive face to anyone who happened to glance across at their table. A slight shudder jiggled her breasts all the time she tried to keep a hold of some control. Fortunately it passed quickly and he let go of her sensitive parts. Hidden by the table a leg still trembled and a spasm twitched at her eye. 

He looked at his watch ticking silently on the table. "That's my game I believe, gentlemen." He said while looking around the table. Each of the gamblers pushed across a single chip congratulating him. "You had better clean up my dear then fetch the order." He said to her with a dismissive gesture of his hand. 

The bottle rattled against the glasses as she poured. Snacks tore open to spill across the bar of the small server's station. She scooped up peanuts and anything else into a bowl not caring about presentation. Melody looked around the room. Despite what she felt no-one stared at her with a telling look for none had witnessed her downfall. She wiped between her legs with a bar cloth, pulled the crotch back into place and stifled a sob. 

She had cum on a stranger's whim, exactly on time for him to win a bet, proving she was just a slut. So much for not being touched but then weren't rules meant to be broken by the privileged and after all she was just a slut ready for it. With cards in their hands they ignored her and the mess she served up. 

"Where has Rich got to? Has he got a weak bladder or something?" Someone asked. 

Wiping up the messy bar a tap on the shoulder startled Melody. "Someone wants a word with you." Shirley said. A younger more petite waitress slipped into position at the station and clicked her tongue loudly at the mess of split drinks and snacks. Melody followed close behind her supervisor afraid someone might see the state of the thong cupping her sex. 

Shirley left her with a tall balding man she recognised from the card table. "My name is Rich and you will obey me, only me. Do you understand?" He ordered. 

"Yes Sir." She answered. 'Oh! No! I'm in trouble now.' She thought. 

He didn't give her a chance to think but continued. "Go to your locker, get changed and return here." He commanded. 

Reluctantly Melody did as she had been told all the time troubled by this new threat. At least she had some clothes to cover her body but was once more without knickers. She followed him to the executive elevator without a word spoken between them. Up several floors to the penthouse suite and he had her safely sitting on a large leather sofa while he poured a drink for himself. She noticed he didn't offer her one though for once she felt the need of a stiff drink. 

She sat still wondering what kind of trouble she was in now. The short red dress had ridden up around her thighs showing off the red suspenders and black stocking tops. The dirty little thong was left behind in the locker with what looked like her only protection from this stranger. At least she knew his first name unlike the man who had played with her at the card table. 

'Damn! He looks the kind of man who is used to commanding people. The way he took control of me, with just a few words, was more effective than my husband or Jim. He paid off that huge debt so he probably thinks he owns me now. I even feel as though he does.' 

Melody was hypnotised under orders to obey this man and completely defenceless, if the past few weeks was anything to go by. On top of that no-one knew where she was. He could keep her for his personal slut, a sex pet, compelled to satisfy his every whim. What if he was a sadist or wanted to collar and brand her? Would she be able to resist anything at all? Were there limits to how far she would go? 

Melody tried to stabilise her racing thoughts, to try and think of a way out of this. It all came down to one thing. He didn't know the phrase to bring her out of the hypnotic state so she would belong to him for ever, unless he became bored with her. What then? Would he pass her on to friends? This could be the first day of a new life, a lifetime of servitude to men as an obedient submissive sex pet. 

The thought was mortifying yet she could feel the slut influence warming her up, she was becoming aroused. Humiliation did that to her now though it seemed anything or anyone could excite her. It was so shameful to think not only was it impossible to refuse anything he wanted but she would be responding with enthusiasm to whatever it was, however degrading.

Jim was wired with coffee when the second hour passed and the troop of staff to the elevator had slowed to a trickle then stopped. No one had exited the door for twenty minutes. It was easy to tell they were staff for without exception the waitresses from the exclusive area were beautiful even in scruffy jeans, though most wore expensive outfits testifying to the level of tips they earned. Not one of them distracted him from his anxious vigil. He felt too responsible, too guilty and too frightened for her. 

Jones came by a second time and took his number and promised to find out what had happened to her. He had to force him home to wait knowing it was pointless telling him to sleep but advising the young man to leave the coffee alone. 

"Don't drink either you may need your wits about you when I phone. Don't worry, whatever is going through your head it will be something completely different, it always is. She will be OK. She's probably working another shift to pay off the debt or might even be home by the time you get there." He clapped a big hand on his shoulder sending Jim on his way. 

*** 

"My names Richard but I'm known as Dig Daddy Rich, my stage name. Just call me Rich." The big man told her. "So what is all this about? What's your tale, do tell." He commanded. 

Melody didn't know where to begin. She told him about her husband then Jim came on the scene and even about the neighbour buggering her. She had to stop a moment and he gave her a glass of water. It was then she realised he hadn't given her a drink for a reason; he wanted her sober and alert. 

It was shameful telling him about the games of sex though he didn't ask for details. Melody squirmed in heat remembering every thing they did together, how exciting and intense it was. 

"Do you love Jim?" He asked. 

"Yes I do." She sighed. 

"What about your husband?" 

"I love him too." She replied. 

"Sounds to me as if he put you two together to make it easier for him to leave. Is he coming back?" 

She hadn't thought of that. "I don't know. I just assumed he would." She described in more detail how the whole thing started while he listened with eyes slightly closed concentrating on what she said. 

"It's difficult to know if he intended for you to just have an affair, a little excitement in your life, a distraction while he was away, or has he gone for good. The problem is how to contact him. What are you going to do if he doesn't return? Will Jim stay, does he love you?" 

"Yes he does, at least he said he does." She pondered for a moment. 

"Write down the phrases that control you and we can make a start on clearing this mess up. Your phone number too." He ordered. 

Melody was more afraid of not being hypnotised than being vulnerable and helpless. She had become used to someone else being in charge; it removing her responsibility for what happened, what she did. 

She heard him phoning but couldn't hear the conversation. Was he spinning some yarn to Jim about her not returning, ever? He had her completely in his power now and she was very unsure of what that meant. 

For the rest of the night the big man went through everything with her. Every detail of the last few weeks she had to explore with him and undo. Like a web it had been wrapped around her, sometimes intentional at other times unintentional, all those influences had been drawn tight about her mind. 

The sun came up and they both gazed out of the window at a new day dawning. The view across the desert was inspiring but she couldn't help feeling afraid. Would she lose both men in her life? This big comforting man had made several phone calls and she still wondered what he was up to. 

"It is your life Melody. You only have one crack at it and you must make the most of it. Live it to the full and don't be afraid if it overflows sometimes. Jim will be here soon. Go and wait in the bedroom. I'll call you when I'm ready." 

She no longer felt like a slut on heat, no longer hypnotised, but still under his influence. She was in his bedroom and would have been preparing herself for him only now she was calm. She sat back in a comfortable armchair wondering how things would turn out. 

"Is he there?" Rich asked security on the phone. "Good, send him up." The phone sounded as soon as he put it down. "Ok! That's clear. No need for a written report. You were quick, I appreciate that. Does he have the message? No don't bring him back he'll have to decide to return or not." He put the phone down and sighed. 

'It's funny how people react when they're afraid.' He thought. Something about money talking crossed his mind too. 

He gave Jim a lecture leaving the young man looking ashamed. 

"I promise to look after her, I love her. I really do." Jim said. 

"I can see that. So now you must let her decide what she wants to do. It's her life, let her decide. Make it easy on her and support her wishes." The big man said with a firm grip on his shoulder. "That does not mean just moving out. She will need you in the next few days. So be there for her. Try to separate what you want from what she wants. End of sermon. Melody!" He called. 

Tears formed in her eyes on seeing Jim and they hugged. She broke off and gave the big man a hug wrapping her arms around him tight. There was nothing she could say but look up into his face with a snotty smile of happiness and adoration. 

He wiped her nose and slapped her ass. "Get outa here!" He said with a satisfied chuckle. He watched them leave hand in hand like innocent young lovers. 

Deciding to take his own advice he phoned home. "I know it's only been a few days but I'm bugging out early. I need some loving from a good woman so prepare yourself honey, your man is on his way to your loving arms." 

On the flight home he itched to see how things would go when the husband returned with his bad news. He could have had the detective set that up for him too but that was going too far on a very personal and private affair. The guy had learnt he had inherited the same illness as his mother. The late stage of the illness meant there was no hope, so he had just run away from it. "It's up to them now." He said quietly to himself. Report_Story
