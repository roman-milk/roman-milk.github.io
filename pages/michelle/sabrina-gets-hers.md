title: Sabrina Gets Hers
---
#1 

===

I used to think that the more love you showed, the more attention you paid, the more you catered to her every wish and desire the woman in your life would realize how lucky she was to have you. I don't think that anymore. Now I believe that all those things just make her take you for granted, they make her think that there isn't anything she can't do that you won't overlook or excuse her for. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Sabrina and I met during our junior year in college. We started dating and for the rest of our junior year we had an on again off again relationship. We both seemed to really like each other and we loved the sex that we had, but neither of us was where we wanted to settle down into a steady relationship. Halfway into our senior year we hooked up again and that time we stayed together. Six months after graduation we were married. 

Shortly thereafter my parents celebrated their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary and during the party I caught my dad alone and asked him how he and mom had managed to stay so happy with each other for so long. I pointed out several couples that we knew who could seem to go a week without fighting over something. 

"How do you and mom manage not to be like everyone else?" 

"The secret son is to tell them that you love them every day, to show them everyday that you love them. Never let yourself get to the point where you take it for granted that they know it. Always show it. Every day of your marriage show it. It is that simple." 

I took his advice to heart and for the next seven years I made sure a day didn't go by that I didn't tell Sabrina that I loved her. I never forgot a birthday, an anniversary or any other special event and I even had a list of 'nonsense' anniversaries that I used for excuses to give cards, flowers and other special gifts. I sent Sabrina flowers to celebrate the anniversary of the first time she made meat loaf and the first time she used our new washer and dryer. I gave her a card on the anniversary of her first promotion at work. No event was too big or too small for me to write it down and use it. She got flowers and candy on the anniversary of the time we first had anal sex. She got diamond earrings to celebrate the first time I ate her pussy. I sent flowers to her at her office for no other reason than to get a card to her during the middle of her day that said, "I love you." 

I did everything I could think of to show her how much she meant to me. I followed my dad's advice, but dad was using his relationship with mom as an example. He didn't allow for the fact that different women would look at the same thing in different ways. Where my mom looked at it as a sign of my dad's continuous love for her, Sabrina saw it as a sign of my insecurity and that I was doing it as a way of begging her for her attention. Somehow my desire to show her my love cheapened me in her eyes. I didn't know that of course and I continued on secure in the knowledge that I had a happy and loving marriage. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Sabrina and I were doing well in our chosen fields. We both climbed the corporate ladder and as we moved up the jobs required more time, more energy, quite a few late nights and some occasional business trips. There were some nights when we didn't even see each other. I would work late and Sabrina would be sleeping when I got home or it would be the other way round. I accepted it as the price we paid for success and I assumed that Sabrina did too. 

When we were together I did my best to make up for the time we were apart. The sex was awesome. There were weekends when we never got dressed. Sabrina smiled, told me that she was mine forever and I of course believed it. I found out different at her company Christmas party. It was held at a downtown hotel. Her company had rented the ballroom and a couple of rooms to use as hospitality suites. The party was held on a Wednesday night and I told Sabrina that I would meet her there. The party started at seven, but I had an out of town client that I had to put on an eight o'clock flight so I told Sabrina not to expect me until eight-thirty or so. At the last minute the client decided to stay another day and do some sight-seeing so I got to the party at seven-thirty. 

I walked into the ballroom just in time to see Sabrina with a man I didn't recognize, but then I didn't really know most of the people she worked with since I only saw them at company picnics and Christmas parties. What struck me as odd was that Sabrina had her arm around his waist. I headed for the room that I'd seen them enter and when I went in I found that it was kind of a vestibule that had three rooms off of it. I wondered which of the rooms they had gone into so I tried the one closest to me and found it empty and so was the room next to it. 

I was just getting ready to close the door and go to the third room when I heard giggling. It seemed to be coming from the room even though the room looked empty so I went back inside to take a closer look. I heard another giggle and I saw that it was coming from an air vent in the ceiling. It dawned on me that I was hearing what was going on in the room next door. I was moving toward the door to go over to the next room when I heard Sabrina say: 

"Careful now, you don't want to tear the dress." 

"Well how in the hell am I supposed to get to your tits?" 

"Here, let me show you." 

"Damn Rina, I never get tired of looking at those beauties. Let me lick those fantastic nipples." 

"Oh no lover, not until you get my toy out. You can't play with my tits until I can play with your cock." 

There was the sound of a zipper being worked and then Sabrina said, "Now there is something that I never get tired of." 

"Are you sure that we don't have time to run up to one of the hospitality suites for a quickie? I need that hot pussy of yours. I need it bad." 

"Oh come on lover, you just had it at lunch and you had it for three hours on Monday night. You can go till tomorrow." 

"No I can't." 

"Well you will just have to. Bob said he would be here around eight-thirty and I need to be here when he walks in. If he gets here early and I walk in with a 'just fucked' look on my face he just might get suspicious and start checking up on me and we don't want that now do we." 

"Come on Rina, if he is the wimp you say he is we could fuck in front of him and it wouldn't matter." 

"I know lover, I could just tell him to go home and we would talk about it when I got there and then I could convince him that we were just kidding and trying to play a joke on him and he'd believe me. But just because I know I can doesn't mean I want to open that particular can of worms." 

"Are you sure we can't run upstairs for a quick one?" 

"I don't want to take the chance lover, but I can take the edge off for you." 

There was a pause and then the man moaned, "Oh God Rina, you are so good at that. Your mouth is pure magic. I've never been sucked off this good before." 

There was a minute or two of moans and 'slurping' sounds and then, "I'm cumming Rina, I'm cumming." A moment or two of silence and then, "You know what's best for me Rina? That you swallow. My wife always spits it out." 

"I swallow because you taste good lover." 

"Mark is going to be so pissed when I tell him you sucked me off and he will have to wait until tomorrow." 

"Maybe not." 

"I thought you said we couldn't tonight." 

"I said we couldn't go up to the hospitality suites. I didn't say anything about not sucking a cock." 

"How can you do that? Mark probably won't get here until after your husband." 

"Blow jobs don't take long baby. I'll introduce you to Bob and then get up to go to the ladies room and while you and Bob guy talk I'll sneak back here with Mark for a quick suck." 

"God Rina, you are one wicked woman." 

"I know lover, that's why you like me." 

"You going to rinse your mouth or kiss your hubby with my cum coating your tongue?" 

"It won't be the first time he's tasted you." 

"Evil Rina, that's what you are, wicked and evil." 

"Come on lover, we need to get back to the party." 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It is just amazing how quick a love can die. I went from undying love and affection to absolute hate in just seconds. The entire time that had been going on I had been warring with myself. Should I kick the door down and then kick ass or sit back and use what I'd just found out to make plans. Should I strike while the iron was hot or wait and get names, dates and places. If I jumped them now it would be a he said/she said situation in divorce court. I could say what I'd overheard and she could flat deny it. I needed more information. Also, if I kicked the door down I might never find out who Mark was or even if there might be more men besides Mark and the guy in the next room with Sabrina. 

No, I'd eventually get around to kicking ass, but it wasn't going to be that night. I hurriedly left the building and went and sat in my car until it was close to the time I'd told Sabrina to expect me. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I entered the ballroom I saw Sabrina sitting at a table with two couples and a single man. Sabrina is five foot eight and the guy she was sitting next to was about four inches taller so unless he had real short legs I guessed him to be about six feet. Black wavy hair and a pencil thin mustache made me peg him as a real grease ball before I even got to the table. Sabrina saw me approaching, stood up and backed away from the table. She opened her arms to greet me with a hug and moved to kiss me with her cum soaked mouth, but at the last second I turned my head and took the kiss on my cheek. I noticed the surprise on her face and I said: 

"I think I'm coming down with something sweetie, I don't want to give it to you." 

She accepted that and then introduced me to the people at the table. The grease balls name was Ron and when he stood up to shake my hand I saw that I was close in my guess. I'm six foot and we were about eye level with each other. It was only important in that I wanted to know his 'reach' when I went after him. 

We sat down and I started to socialize with my wife's co-workers. I sensed that the two couples were a little uneasy, almost as if they were expecting something to happen. I danced two numbers with Sabrina and during the second one she whispered in my ear: 

"This thing you are coming down with isn't going to get in the way of you jumping my bones tonight is it? I've been horny as hell all day just thinking about you." 

Yeah, I'll just bet you have I thought. What I wanted to say was, "No Rina, I don't think so," but I didn't. I had never called her Rina like Ron had and I wasn't ready to do anything to alarm her just yet so what I said was, "We will just have to wait and see how things go and what I feel like when we get home." 

Sabrina didn't know it yet, but she was never going to have sex with me again. When the music stopped and we returned to the table there was another man sitting there talking to Ron and Sabrina introduced me to Mark. About five foot ten and maybe one-eighty. He had soft looking hands and a weak chin and I filed that information away. 

About ten minutes later Mark got up to go visit some people at another table and I kept track of him out of the corner of my eye. I wasn't surprised to see him go through the door that led back to the room where Sabrina had sucked off Ron. Obviously Ron had primed him while Sabrina and I were out on the dance floor. A couple of minutes later Sabrina got up, kissed me on the cheek and told me she was going to the bathroom. Ron let her get a few feet from the table and then he asked me what I thought of the Bronco's chances to get to the Super Bowl. Obviously Sabrina had told him I was an avid football fan and he would use that to keep me occupied while Sabrina snuck off to see Mark. 

As I talked football with Ron I had one corner of my eye on the door Mark had gone through and less than a minute later Sabrina went through it. It was almost fifteen minutes before Sabrina came back to the table and I kept talking to Ron and acted as if I hadn't noticed how long she was gone. I wondered if Ron picked up on what I did – Sabrina had been fucked – Mark had gotten a bit more than a blow job. I don't know if anyone else at the table picked up on it, but after ten years of marriage I could tell the signs. I don't think Sabrina even knew that I knew her that well. 

After she returned to the table I danced with her again and she molded herself to me. 

"I'm horny baby, really, really horny. Please don't let me down tonight. I'm so horny that my panties are soaking wet. When I went to the bathroom I was positively dripping. I need you lover, I need you bad. If this party weren't so fucking political I'd drag you out of here right now." 

The "So I can give you sloppy seconds" went unsaid and I wondered if kissing me with a cum soaked mouth or having me push my cock into another man's cum was a turn on for her. When we got back to the table Mark asked Sabrina to dance and as they moved out onto the floor I saw a smirk on the face of one of the women at the table as she looked in my direction. I thought of that old cliché, "The husband is the last to know." Mark brought her back and then Ron took her out and I saw the two women at the table smile knowingly at each other. I filed it away. If it was common knowledge with the people she worked with it shouldn't be too hard to find out what I needed to know. 

Sabrina danced with several of the people she reported to and then she spent fifteen minutes sitting at her boss's table talking with him. When she came back to our table she whispered: 

"Okay lover, I've been seen and I've danced with who I had to dance with. Race you home lover. Be ready for me, I need it bad." 

We were in separate cars and I gave her a good head start. I wanted her home, undressed and on the bed when I got home. That way she could experience the full effect of what I had planned. I drove slow to make sure that she had time to be like I wanted. When I got home I rushed upstairs and through the master bedroom to the toilet where I faked heaving my guts out. I stayed in the bathroom making the appropriate noises for several minutes and then I went to the sink, ran the water and wiped my forehead down with a wet rag. I went into the bedroom toweling my face off and found Sabrina lying naked on the bed. 

"Sorry baby, I don't know what it is, but I'm not going to give it to you. I'll sleep in the spare bedroom tonight and call the doctor in the morning." 

I could see that she was pissed as I left the room. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

I was up before Sabrina in the morning and I was sitting at the kitchen table sipping coffee trying to look like someone who was ill when she came into the room. 

"Feeling any better," she asked. 

"Not really. I hardly slept at all." 

I looked at my watch, "Doctor's office doesn't open till eight-thirty. I'd better call work and let them know I won't be in today." I reached for the phone as she poured herself a cup of coffee and then went to get ready to go to work. 

"Don't forget I'll be late tonight," she said. "We are still working on that damned budget proposal that has to be finished by next Tuesday." 

Yeah, I'll just bet you will I thought as I hung up the phone without making a call. After Sabrina left for work I dressed and went into my office and cleaned up work that I couldn't let hang then I told my secretary that I had a doctor's appointment and would be out the rest of the day. I left the office and headed for the public library. I dug into the reverse directories and soon had addresses and phone numbers for Ronald Bragg and Mark Trevail. Then, using the library's computers I dug into the information on the company Sabrina worked for. 

I pulled up the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all the corporate officers and of all the board members. I checked into the backgrounds of the top officers and the chairman of the board to try and get some idea of how they might react to scandal and was pleased at what I found. If I was right in my read even the barest hint of scandal would get Sabrina and her two fuck buddies thrown out on their butts. 

That evening I was parked just down the street from Sabrina's place of employment and when she came out at ten after five I followed her as she drove across town. She pulled into a motel parking lot, got out of her car and walked to room 131. She knocked and the door opened and Mark stood aside and let her in. Twenty minutes later Ron pulled in, got out of his car and went to room 131. I could only assume that he was there to attend the budget meeting too. I wondered if Sabrina's company appreciated the fact that their employees worked on the budget on their own time and at their own expense. I could have been wrong, one of them could be turning in an expense report for the meeting. Yeah, right! I wrote down the make, model and license plate number of Ron's car and then I went on home. 

As I drove I pondered on what else I'd found out about Ron and Mark. Both were married, but I had no way of knowing whether they were happily married or not. All I had to go on was that neither was at the company party. I would need to find out more about them and possibly get them involved in my plot to break it off in Sabrina's, Ron's and Mark's ass. 

I also thought about some things I had never paid attention to before. Things like Sabrina always working late on Monday and Thursdays. I never doubted her when she told me that Monday ran long because they had to take care of all the problems that surfaced on the weekend. Thursday she worked late because that was the day they had to finish all the reports that had to be turned in on Friday. Why would I doubt her? I was stupid with love where she was concerned. I was only just finding out how stupid. 

I was in bed reading when I heard her come home. I turned off the light, put the book down and pretended to be asleep. She opened the door, looked in and then closed the door and went into her bedroom and a few minutes later I heard the shower running. 

Sleep did not come easy that night. I lay there, staring up at the ceiling, and tried to think of some way that I could take down the three of them at the same time and ruin them. It had to be all three at once because I didn't want any one of them to see something happen to the others and take steps to protect themselves. After it was done I would let them know who did it and knowing that they would know why. 

And then it came to me. I sat up and turned on the light and picked up the book I was reading. It was a murder mystery about a man framed for murder. He had been convicted based on planted evidence and a lawyer and a private eye were working frantically to prove him innocent before he could be executed. That would do it I thought as I put the book down and turned off the light. Now that I knew what I was going to do I fell asleep and slept like a baby. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Friday morning I told Sabrina that the doctor said I had a touch of intestinal flu and that with medication it should clear up in a couple of days. 

"I'm still a little weak, but he says I should be strong enough to go to work on Monday. He doesn't want me to do anything but rest this weekend." 

Sabrina touched my cheek and said, "Rest up and get your strength back lover, you are going to need it. I've been deprived and I need to play catch up" and then she left for work. I got dressed and left the house to do more research. By the end of the day I knew that Ron's wife was a legal secretary and that she hadn't been at the party because she was out of town visiting a sick mother. Mark's wife sold real estate and she had missed the party because she was trying to close a deal on a two million dollar property. Both marriages seemed stable, but I guessed that was because neither woman knew about what their hubby's were up too. I would correct that and soon.  

===

I spent a quiet weekend at home and told Sabrina that I felt up to going to work on Monday. 

"I'm still a little weak, but I should be okay as long as I don't overdue it." 

Monday evening I again followed Sabrina to the same motel, but it was room 146 and Ron met her at the door and let her in. Five minutes later Mark pulled up and went into the room. I wrote down the info on Mark's car and drove home. 

I was still sleeping in the spare bedroom and I faked being asleep when Sabrina got home. I was going to have to find a new excuse for staying away from her; I couldn't use the flu as an excuse forever and I was going to need at least another week to put my plan together. I decided to keep it simple. I would use one of Sabrina's own tricks against her. Whenever we argued over something or fought over something Sabrina's response was always to cut me off until she decided to make up with me. As much as she liked sex it never bothered her to cut me off for as much as six months, but of course now I knew why it never bothered her. She only cut me off, not her lovers. 

When I got home from work on Tuesday Sabrina was waiting for me. 

"How are you feeling baby?" 

"Pretty good." 

"Up for some fun in the bedroom?" 

"After dinner. I need to build up my strength a little bit more." 

I'd thought about it all day, about how to get Sabrina so pissed at me that she would cut me off as far as sex was concerned. It wasn't until quitting time that the idea came to me. I was walking to the elevator and one of the file clerks was walking in front of me. She was wearing slacks and I was admiring her ass and suddenly I smiled - I knew what I was going to do. 

We finished dinner and I helped clear the table and then Sabrina washed the dishes and I dried them and put them away. 

"Ready to make up for lost time lover?" 

"Lead the way." 

She was undressing and dropping clothes as we headed for the bedroom and I wondered how she could be so hot for me to fuck her when she obviously didn't give a rat's ass about me. She thought I was a wimp and she told her boyfriend I was. She held me in contempt so why the big push to get me to make love to her? Well, she wouldn't push after I was done with her this time. 

She was naked when we got to the bedroom and she got right onto the bed. I told her to get on her hands and knees and she ginned at me as she did it. Doggie was her favorite position. She wiggled her ass and said: 

"Hurry baby, hurry. I need it bad. I've gone almost a week without you and I'm going crazy." 

I moved up behind her and ran a finger into her cunt to loosen her up and I found that she was wet, really wet and I knew then that she'd had a nooner with one or both of her boyfriends. Was that what her wanting to fuck me was all about? Seeing to it that I got her lover's sloppy seconds? No matter, their juices were going to help me. I took my cum covered finger out of her pussy and slid my cock into her. I started slowly fucking her and then I took my wet finger and shoved it into Sabrina's ass. 

"What the hell are you doing?" she cried as she tried to pull away. "You know I don't like that." 

Of course I knew it, that was the whole point. She tried to scoot away from me but I held on and scooted after her. She got to the head board and couldn't go any farther in that direction and I had too firm a grip on her for her to turn and move to the side. I pulled my cum coated cock out of her pussy and then I drove it into her ass. She screamed as I started slamming my cock into her: 

"Stop it, stop it" she sobbed, "I don't like this, you know I don't like this." 

"How do you know that Sabrina, you have never let me try it before. How do you know you don't like it if you've never tried it," I said while thinking "at least you have never tried it with me. Maybe you found out you didn't like it when you did it with one of your boyfriends." 

Sabrina buried her head in a pillow and her sobs turned into moans and I smiled as I listened to them and fucked her. I hadn't had sex in over a week and I wasn't able to make the grudge fuck last as long as I would have liked, but it had lasted long enough to accomplish my purpose. I blasted a load into her, pulled out and started to get off the bed. 

"Damn, that was fun. I'll go wash my cock and then you can suck me hard. I feel like I can go all night." 

Sabrina scrambled to get off the bed, "You bastard! You rotten fucking bastard!" she screamed at me as she ran out of the room. Sabrina didn't talk to me for the rest of the week and didn't that just break my heart. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

My plan was not without some risk to me. If I got caught doing what I had to do I would be the one ruined. The fact that I was willing to take the chance showed just how badly I wanted my revenge. It was expensive, but if it did what I wanted it would be the best money I ever spent. Phone calls to friends who had friends who knew people got me in touch with the man I needed and a midnight meeting in a parking lot got me what I had to have. By the following Sunday I was ready and when Sabrina went to work Monday morning the die was cast. 

That night I again followed Sabrina to the motel and when she and her two lovers were inside room 136 I got out of my car and went over to Ron's. I found it unlocked and I popped the trunk and planted the half-pound of marijuana behind the spare tire. Mark's car was locked and so I had to use the Slim Jimmy that I had purchased from a Snap On tool man to break into the car. I opened his trunk and planted a pound of grass in it and then locked the car up after sprinkling an ounce of the grass on the back bumper to give the police probable cause for a search. 

I drove half a block away and called the cops from a pay phone and reported seeing a drug buy taking place in room 136 of the motel and then I gave the plate numbers of Sabrina's, Ron's and Mark's cars. They asked me for my name and I quickly said: "No way man. I ain't setting myself up to get whacked by no bunch of Colombians" and I hung up. 

I drove to another pay phone and called all three local TV stations and gave them the same information I had given the cops. There had just been an election and the new mayor had campaigned vowing a war on drugs and I knew the cops would react quickly. The TV stations knew the same thing and they would get there to get the story. 

I drove another block to a third pay phone and called and called Ron's and Mark's wives and told them that their husbands were in room 136 at the Sea Breeze motel with a woman and then I drove back and parked out of the way where I could watch without anyone wondering about me. 

It only took ten minutes for the police to get there, but it took them another half-hour to get organized. First a couple of squad cars showed up, then the SWAT van followed by two unmarked cars full of plain clothes detectives. By the time the cops were ready the news reporters were on the scene and the TV vans had arrived and set up. I watched as two SWAT cops took down the motel room door with a ram and let four other SWAT cops go bounding in with guns at the ready. 

God, but I do wish I could have been a fly on the wall and have seen Sabrina's face when that door crashed down. Three minutes later Sabrina, Mark and Ron were led out of the room in handcuffs. Mark and Ron had their under shorts on, but Sabrina was naked under the blanket thrown over her shoulders. I hit a preset on my cell phone and called the president of Sabrina's company. When he answered I said: 

"Are you aware that three of your middle management people are running a drug ring out of your corporate office?" 

I told him who they were and what was going on at the Sea Breeze even as we were speaking. I made the same phone call to all five members of the board of directors and then I drove on home. When the cops searched Ron and Mark's cars the cops would find the planted grass and in Sabrina's purse they would find an ounce of cocaine. Under the front seat of her car they would find four more ounces. Not knowing what Ron and Mark's wives looked like I don't know if they were in the crowd that had gathered or not, but I certainly hoped that they were there. 

The story was on the ten o'clock news on channels two and seven. I had to laugh when the anchorman on seven said: 

"Mayor Jones started keeping his campaign promise today as the police took down a major drug ring operating out of one of the city's motels. No news yet as to how much was seized." 

There was footage of the three arrested "drug kingpins" and we were encouraged to "stay tuned for more breaking news." I turned off the TV, unplugged the phone and went to bed. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I laughed when Sabrina asked me to put the house up as security so she could get bail. She finally talked her parents into putting up the money and when she got out of jail and came home she found the all the locks changed and all of her stuff piled in boxes in the driveway. 

"Why are you doing this to me" she asked. 

"Because you are a whore and I don't want anything to do with you any more." 

"But you don't understand. If you would just let me explai..." 

"I got all the explanation I needed when I saw you on the news being led naked out of a motel room" and I shut the door in her face. 

I did help her father load all of her stuff in a U-Haul, but I refused to talk with him about his daughter. Sabrina called two or three times a day, but I would never talk to her and when she showed up at my office one day I had security remove her from the building. 

She, Mark and Ron just 'happened' to be caught up in a downsizing at their firm. And the three didn't fare too well when it came to their legal problems. Even though they were first offenders, because of the mayor's anti drug stance they did not get the probation that a lot of other first offenders received. They didn't help themselves by continuing to protest their innocence even though they were caught with the goods. Sabrina hurt herself big time when she demanded a blood test to prove there were no drugs in her system. The test showed her as clean as the driven snow which allowed the prosecutor to claim that it was proof that the drugs found in her purse and in her car were for sale and not for personal use. 

Because the mayor wanted to show immediate results of his war on drugs the three were offered a deal. One year jail time and two thousand hours of community service. With good behavior they could be out in nine months. Their lawyer told them they were toast so they took the deal. While Sabrina was locked up I filed for divorce as did Ron's wife and Mark's wife. 

The three of them did their time and when they got out I kept track of them. When the time was right I went calling on Mark. I heard later that he had three broken ribs and a broken arm when he got to the hospital delivery room. I suppose he could have pressed charges, but I was willing to take my chances in front of a jury. A man stomping the man who was screwing his wife would get me sympathy from the men on the jury anyway. Either Mark apparently figured it would go that way or he felt guilty for what he'd done so he let it drop. 

Ron and Sabrina were staying together and I caught them coming out of a bar one night. After I had finished with Ron and had kicked him in the nuts for the sixth time I turned to Sabrina and said: 

"Not bad for a wimp huh...RINA? Remember the Christmas party where you sucked off Ron in that little back room? Remember him saying, "If he's the wimp you say he is we could fuck right in front of him and get away with it? Remember that... RINA?" 

I saw her face change as it all came together for her and I laughed. "That's right RINA, the wimp got back at your cheating ass. Better call an ambulance for your boyfriend here. He don't look so hot." 

She was still staring at me as I got in my car and drove away. Report_Story
