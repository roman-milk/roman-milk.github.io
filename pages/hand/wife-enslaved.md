Mistaken for a slave 

Riana put on the outfit, and tried not to laugh. It was meant to impress her husband, or at least show willingness to play at satisfying him. He'd recently bought a slave girl, meaning their fragile relationship had finally broken. She decided to do something to save their marriage, by convincing him he didn't need the damn girl. 

Over the last year or so their lives had diverged, with them hardly having time for each other. It was time to regain Adrian's interest, or lose her position in his life. He probably wouldn't divorce her, as it would be too embarrassing and expensive. Neither of them would want the social stigma of a messy divorce. Besides that, it would dent the luxury life style she had become accustomed to. 

Instead, she was determined to rekindle their sex life. Hence the slave outfit being tried on. He would be back from a business trip later, and decided to try it out before he returned. As a mature, thirty-five year old woman, she was shapely and impressively attractive. She'd prepared herself at a fitness retreat, toning, and honing her figure in preparation. She felt at ease with her body, and was ready to play. 

The staff had been dismissed, leaving her alone to receive Adrian. They could play at being master and slave for the whole weekend, without interruption. A servant sent the slave to their lodge in the country, to keep the nuisance out of the way. She hadn't met her and didn't want to, as she was bound to be young and attractive. 

Looking in the mirror brought on a mood to play. Imagining being a slave, having to obey a master, had her pressing a hand tightly between her legs. The feeling of having all responsibility taken away, leaving her free to misbehave, was liberating. Having to satisfy a master, being helpless to resist, unable to say no to anything he demanded was erotic, and wonderfully arousing. 

'No! No more. I must savour the moment he arrives home, and offer myself to my husband and master,' she giggled. 

She felt young, attractive, and excited at the prospect of playing a naughty fantasy game. In the kitchen, she prepared a drink to steady her nerves. Maybe she wasn't so confident as first thought. 

'You! I need breakfast,' Jimmy demanded. 'Something for a sore head too.' 

Riana swiftly turned, to see all of last nights' guests hadn't left after all. The surprise appearance shook her from the fantasies she'd been contemplating. Her mouth hung open, while her head caught up with the unexpected. 

'Get a move on, slave,' Jimmy demanded. 

He couldn't shout as his head pounded. A tall glass of orange, then a coffee, followed by food, would do the trick. 

'I didn't know anyone was here,' she lamely said. 

'Evidently I am. Your master rejected my business proposal last night, so I drowned my sorrows and slept late. Now I'm suffering a hangover, as well as the loss of a profitable deal,' he complained. 

She figured out who this must be. It was the son of an important investor her husband dealt with. Yesterday evening she'd kept clear of the business dinner, while they discussed their boring deals. The servants had been left to entertain Adrian and his guests. 

What was she to do? Immodestly showing off her body to a stranger was dreadful. Adrian was sure to find out, as young men always bragged to their friends. This young man would embellish the encounter with a semi-naked woman, making it into something it wasn't. Maybe he would tell an exaggerated tale to his father, which would get back to her husband. 

'Well? Get a move on, slave,' he chivvied her into motion. 

While trying to pull the diaphanous one-piece costume together to hide her body, she scampered to a cupboard. 

'I heard Mr Reagan had bought a slave. You look good, though a bit old for a slave girl,' he sniggered. 

Opening cupboards to find something to cook, hadn't been a decision, it was a reaction. She'd just responded to his firm order on the spur of the moment, and continued to go along with it. Pretending to be a slave was an option. Though, it was hard to think of another way to avoid the embarrassment of admitting who she really was. The important thing was to save face, for her, as well as for her husband. 

Riana found condiments in the first cupboard opened, so selected what he might want. With a coffee cup in one hand, and a small tray of sauces in the other, she leaned over the table. Before she could lay them before him, her breasts swung out the top. 

'That's very nice, but I'd rather have breakfast first,' he quipped. 

Bent over him with her breasts on show, stunned her. As though in slow motion, she watched his hands approach her breasts. He pushed them back into the top. She quickly dropped the cup and tray onto the table and retreated. 

Her eyes were unseeing, as she opened and closed cupboards. There was no turning back now. She would have to play this dire game through to the end. Hell! What was she to do, if her husband returned before this lout left the house. 

One thing at a time. Feed him, and he would go. A young man had things to do, and places to go. He didn't look as though he would hang around. Not like her breasts had. Shit! 

'Stop thinking about that, and get on with it,' she silently admonished herself. 

'Are you cursing me under your breath?' Jimmy asked. 

'No, sir,' Riana quickly answered. 

The fridge was well stocked, so at last she began the process. The microwave set itself according to the food pushed in. Different parts of the dish were zapped according to cooking times. She often wondered if they needed a cook. There were social and government obligations, so they had to provide jobs for those who suffered in the financial crisis. It was all a part of their social scene, and had to be seen to be done. Hence the household servants, and the recent fashionable addition, a household slave. 

'Make sure the eggs are free range, and the bacon isn't animal fat, slave,' he sullenly directed. 

'Yes, sir,' she sighed. 

Who in the twenty-second century used animals for food? He was just commanding her for the sake of it, to make him feel superior. She clicked her tongue in exasperation. 

'I don't like your attitude, slave,' he goaded her. 

Oh God! She'd just noticed her nipples were showing large and dark through the filmy silk. She wondered what else was being shown off to this arrogant young man. The lighting in her bedroom was subdued, when she tried the outfit on. The slave costume was meant for Adrian's bedroom, not the brightly lit kitchen. 

'Does your master know you run around the house so lewdly?' he asked. 

'Yes, sir, err, no, sir,' she stammered. 

The slits up the sides of the pantaloons revealed tantalising glimpses of her legs. She now realised the horrible baggy pants were translucent, showing off everything. It was difficult walking around the kitchen while keeping her thighs pressed together. 

'What's wrong with you? You're walking like a pregnant duck. I've a good mind to tell your master how useless you are,' he admonished her. 

'Please don't, sir. I'm trying my best, sir,' she simpered. 

At thirty-five it was infuriating being ordered around by this young nineteen year old know it all. Especially as it was her house. It was galling having to act like a humble slave girl. She could hardly be called a girl, but then all female slaves were called girl, whatever their age. 

'I've finished, slave. You can clear away, and fix some fresh coffee,' Jimmy ordered. 

'Yes, sir,' she said, trying to keep her voice neutral. 

Disguising her emotions was paramount. It was obvious he would react badly to an angry outburst from a slave. He'd grown up after the fall of the banking empire, so was used to having everything he wanted, while others had nothing. He was young and arrogant, expecting everyone to fall in line with his requirements. 

'Your coffee, sir,' she said. 

She wanted to tell him - what did your last slave die of, overwork? She bit her tongue, not wanting to put him in a bad mood. If the situation deteriorated, all would have to be revealed. Not her body, but her position in this house would have to be revealed. 

'No milk, slave,' he instructed. 

Who the hell did he think he was? His father was an important man, but he had a lot to learn. He should be made to earn respect, not just demand it. 

'Of course, sir, sorry sir,' she said, trying to hide the bitterness from her voice. 

Riana realised she was keeping herself in place, as a slave, rather than him keeping her enslaved. She wondered if it had something to do with the fantasy he interrupted. While she tidied up, he was watching the financial news, as though he were the master of the house, and she, a mere lackey. She shook her head to rid it of the incongruous thought. 

All finished, she reached for the coffee cup. The meal was complete, and he could be on his way. She on the other hand would be left here, facing embarrassment, and a sense of having been wrongly used. The idea of being wrongly used, sent a thrill through her body. 

'I've not finished that,' he complained. 

His sudden movement knocked the coffee dregs over his shirt. Her hand was on the cup, so she was to blame. A woman, and especially a slave, was used to taking the blame, and so she admitted it. 

'Sorry, sir,' she automatically responded. 

Back with a cloth, she dabbed at the shirt. 

'Stop that, you're making it worse. You clumsy slave, you've ruined it,' Jimmy shouted. 

'It was your fault!' she blurted out. 

She couldn't take any more of his overblown ego. She opened her mouth to blast him out of her house, and to hell with the consequences. If her husband sulked for the next six months, so be it. 

'Whoa! What you doing?' she cried out. 

The kitchen floor swung up to meet her face, only just halting short of a collision. Riana couldn't believe she was upside down, over the boy's lap. A heavy slap to her bottom drove home what was happening, shocking her mind into quickly catching up. 

'Stop it! I'll tell Adrian. Stop it now!' she cried out. 

'Take your punishment, slave. Or, I'll tell Adrian you've been a careless slave girl,' he shouted. 

That stopped the complaining. The last thing she wanted was for her husband to hear she had been over his knee, and spanked. Having anyone find out would be humiliating enough to keep her quiet. As soon as she accepted this dire spanking, it would satisfy his ego, and he would stop. 

'Sorry, sir, please don't hurt this humble slave,' she whined. 

Riana hoped the pathetic voice would stop him. 

The filmy pantaloons did nothing to cushion the impact. The last stroke was upon her bare bottom, where the material gave way. It wasn't the sting that had her capitulating, it was the indignity of being spanked by a young man. 

As she stood before him, with head suitably bowed, she felt cowed. The fight had been spanked out of her. 

'What do you say, slave?' he demanded. 

'Sorry, sir. Sorry for being a clumsy slave girl,' she simpered. 

All her remaining effort went into refraining from rubbing her sore bottom, and not bursting into tears. Concentrating on that, left her bereft of thought over how to handle this calamitous situation. 

Damn him! The sooner he went the better. She would avoid the social events her husband arranged, from never wanting to see this callous youth again. It would be easy enough, the way things were with their marriage. He concentrated on business, while she attended charity committees, and fund raising functions. 

'You look suitably chastened, girl. You needed putting in your place. Do I need to tell your owner?' Jimmy harshly asked. 

'No, sir! Please, sir, please don't tell Master Adrian, sir,' she pathetically spoke. 

It wasn't an act now. She meant it. Even the grovelling was genuine. A little more grovelling was called for, to keep him quiet, and satisfy his overblown self-importance. 

Were all men like that? Easily satisfied by a few words of submission? Perhaps that was how they reacted together, to save coming to blows. One bowing to the other, showing who was top dog in the pack. A million years as a hunting pack, following the dominant leader, couldn't be thrown off easily. This was the twenty-second century, but a few thousand years of civilisation wasn't so influential as it seemed. 

'Tuck your breasts back in,' he inconsequently spoke. 

'Yes, sir, sorry, sir,' she lamely said, while trying to keep them under control. 

'You've kept yourself well shaved, I see,' he smirked. 

'Yes, sir. Oh!' she cut off the response, on realising what he meant. 

The boy could see her shaved pussy! Damn the stupid outfit. She'd bought an expensive slave set, and the silk had been designed to be ripped off in the bedroom, not the kitchen. The sirik chains that came with the outfit, didn't have to be worn, and now that decision was regretted. At least the leather wrist and ankle cuffs kept some of the material in place. 

'Nice, very nice,' he smiled, while looking directly between her legs. 

Riana felt so humiliated, it was a wonder she didn't run away and hide. Instead, she stood before him with head bowed, looking pathetic. Only now he'd mentioned it, did she feel her sex opening up to him. The fantasies she'd been thinking about had almost come true. She had a master! Why did it have to be this damnable bastard, instead of her husband 

'Oh! God! Please don't let him get any ideas about me,' she silently pleaded. 

She was practically naked, showing off her body to an arrogant young man, who was used to taking what he wanted. He could see her sex was ready. Though not for him, it was just the circumstances, truly nothing to do with him. The way he was looking at her, studying her, was frightening. She told herself to run and hide, yet stood there immobile like a frightened rabbit. 

A communications light flashed in a corner of the screen. The screen was the latest gadget, taking up one wall of the kitchen. She could see it in a mirror, and groaned at the identity of the caller. The small image in the corner of the screen was her husband! 

'Not now, now like this!' she inwardly cried. 

The usual greetings were murmured. No friendliness between those two, she thought. Between her and the door was that large new screen. She was trapped in a corner of the kitchen, not daring to move, or make a sound. If she'd only been able to escape, to change into something decent, it would be something. The only thing holding the getup together were the chains, and leather cuffs. 

'Got up late, hope you don't mind. I'll be going soon. Any chance of changing your mind over the proposal?' Jimmy asked. 

'No, afraid not,' came the immediate reply. 

'I'll try Fotherington Investments. It might mean my father favours them rather than your corporation in future, but I'm sure you can withstand the loss,' Jimmy said. 

There was silence from the other end of the line, except the ticking of Adrian's brain. 

'Of course, you could do me a favour instead,' Jimmy offered. 

'What's that,' Adrian heavily sighed. 

'You could lend me your slave for the week,' Jimmy said. 

Riana silently screamed at her husband not to agree. Her whole body vibrated between action and inaction. How could she dance naked in front of the screen, before her husband and that boy? It was as frustrating as hell, as she desperately needed to demand a refusal to this horrible suggestion, yet she was unable to find the strength to reveal her presence. 

A little dance of annoyance was carried out in a corner of the kitchen. Back and forth her feet pattered, trying to generate the power to assert herself. They were talking about her, as a commodity to be traded. 

Eventually, after much talking, she heard the damning words of agreement. 

'Alright. I'll send the document of funding for your acceptance, and you can borrow the slave. You'll need the paperwork, and to enter the destination, before taking the slave away. The slave papers are in the top draw of my desk. Keep to the rules, or the deal is off,' Julian stated. 

'Sure, no problem. I won't be using it. It's just to show I'm doing my bit for society. I can't buy a slave, as I need all the funds at my disposal for this new project,' he reassured Adrian. 

No! Her husband had just lent her to this arrogant bastard. It looked as though she would be serving this cretin for a whole week. He'd promised not to use her, and she knew what that meant. How nice of him! He wasn't going to fuck her, but instead, she would be humiliated by being flaunted as a slave girl. Shit! How was she to withstand a whole week at this damn boy's beck and call? 

It was too late now, her husband had closed the deal, and rung off. Could she possibly dare reveal who she was. Her body had been exposed, but could she dispose of her self-respect by opening up to the cruellest ridicule. If it was revealed she was the wife, not a slave, a rumour would be exaggerated and spread like wildfire among the gossips. In their exclusive community, her name would be mud, and her standing would be dirt. 

No! She felt so low, she couldn't do it. If he baulked the agreement, and tried anything on, she could walk out. Coming home with her tail between her legs would be terrible, but maybe it wouldn't come to that. She was an old woman in his eyes. She would be a cheap way of keeping his house in order. Oh! Shit! She would be his humble housemaid! 

While she was quaking over her fate, he found the slave paperwork, and dialled for transport. 

'I need to change. Please, sir,' she protested. 

'No. Just go. You're not a free woman with the luxury of taking hours preparing to go out. You're a slave, so do as you are told,' he scolded her. 

He slapped her sore ass, to quicken her step toward the waiting vehicle. 

*** 

They sat in the auto-vehicle, letting it find its way to his house. Both were silent on the drive to his home. He was still hung over, and she was numb with fear. Anger took over from arousal as they neared their destination. She had been unwittingly trapped into this dire situation. In effect, her husband had leant her to this young man, to act as his household slave. Being a part of a contract, left her feeling small, insignificant, and angry. She couldn't totally blame Adrian, as he didn't know it was his wife he had given away. 

Shit! She had to blame someone. If he hadn't bought that damn slave girl, which forced her to compete for him, she wouldn't have been mistaken for a slave. She wouldn't be facing the objectionable prospect of being a household slave, if it wasn't for his uncaring crassness. So it was his fault! 

Standing in the entrance hall to his home, Riana trembled, unsure if it were from fear, or anger. 

'I'll not have you running around in my house like a whore. Follow me to your quarters, where you can change into something decent, slave,' he stated. 

The harsh tone of voice enforced the feeling of being small and insignificant. She caught sight of herself in a mirror, and felt humiliated. He was right, she looked woefully indecent. The top and pantaloons were falling off her body. What was left of the outfit, was see-through. In the privacy of a bedroom, with her husband, the outfit was sexy and alluring. Not here though. In the bright lights of a strangers home it was positively lewd. 

'Yes, sir, sorry, sir,' she stammered. 

She wanted to run and hide away in a corner somewhere, to cry over this terrible situation. How could she possibly tell him who she was, without adding to the humiliation. She meekly followed him up the grand curving staircase. A small door led to a less well decorated area of his home, where servants lived. 

'In here, slave,' he ordered. 

His commanding voice, pushed her further down, into feeling like a lowly slave. 

'Take a shower, and I'll sort something out for you to wear,' he commanded.  

===

The small, sparsely decorated room, contained an uncomfortable looking bed. A well worn rug lay over wooden floorboards. This is all she now deserved, as a humble slave girl. A shower cubicle was built into a corner of the room, so there was nowhere to undress. 

'Hurry up, I've got things to do,' he chided her. 

The idea that she no longer had important things to do, flickered into her mind. Her world now revolved around attending upon this young man, her master. She pulled at the thin material, which was designed to be ripped from her body in a sex game. All she wore were the chains of the sirik. Slaves didn't wear chains, but she did, as the outfit wasn't meant to be practical. It was meant for fun in the bedroom, with her husband. 

'Sir,' she said, to gain his attention. 

'What now?' he asked. 

'The chains, sir. I don't have the keys to release them,' she pointed out. 

'Just shower and be careful of them. Hurry up,' he added, and slapped her bare bottom. 

At least he didn't look at her nakedness with lust in his eyes. Instead of being pleased, it dragged her down, feeling it as yet another put-down. He really did mean she was to be nothing more than an addition to the household servants. Though less than that, as she was a mere slave. 

She quickly soaped her body, rinsed, and stepped out onto the rug. 

'Use this,' he brusquely said. 

She took the old towel and patted her body. She was used to soft towels, blow dried to be extra fluffy and warm, by a personal maid. Her self-esteem dropped through the floor. She carefully dried the chains and cuffs, then draped the rag over a hook on the wall. 

'There's nothing here that will fit you. Wait here, and I'll get something,' he said. 

It seemed like an age before he returned. She stood with hands to her sides, not daring to hide her charms, in case he spanked her again. Not that he was taking much notice of her figure. 

'Try this on, and come down stairs to my study. Don't keep me waiting, or you will be punished, slave,' he warned. 

She quickly dressed, not wanting to be spanked again. She opened a couple of doors before finding the master's study. She straightened the frilly white apron, and the pushed loose hair into the cap. Silently she walked in to stand before him. 

He wasn't waiting for her. His head was down, studying a report. He looked up, and she bowed her head. It was a submissive gesture, and portrayed how she felt. 

'Good, you'll do. Find the kitchen, and make me a coffee, slave,' he demanded. 

'Yes, sir, right away, sir,' she gushed. 

The maids outfit felt more sexy than the diaphanous slave costume. Had she been elevated in status from slave to servant? This morning she was a fashionable rich lady, wearing expensive jewellery, living in a large comfortable house, and waited upon by servants. She had fallen from being in a wealthy social network, to the depths of society. 

The white frilly petticoats swished under the short black dress as she walked. The shiny black high heels were a little difficult to walk in, but she managed. The black stockings felt nice, though they were fiddly when connecting to the suspenders. At last the sirik chains was almost covered up. 

The small leather cuffs at her wrists were covered by white cuffs, of the long sleeved dress. The chains were only visible dangling from the dress, down to ankle cuffs. A choker covered the slave collar, where chains were attached. The sirik chains were polished, thin titanium; nothing cheap and nasty. They ran from the collar to wrists and ankles. 

Silently approached his large desk, she stood waiting for him to notice her. This time when looking into a mirror, she was suitably impressed. She looked magnificently sexy. Her master looked up at her, still deeply thinking over some figures, not hers. 

'Put it there, and go find something to clean and tidy up, slave,' he said. 

Summarily dismissed, she went off to discover if she knew how to be a maid. Tidying and cleaning had never been demanded of her before. She had been a beautiful trophy wife, married off to Adrian as part of her father's business deal with Adrian's father. They had their moments, but in the last years the novelty had worn off, and they led their own separate lives. 

Fortunately Jimmy didn't check up on her abilities, or look in the waste bin, where broken ornaments had been disposed of. When it came to meal times she was confident from while away at university, where she had at least learnt to cook. It was just a matter of selecting the right packets, and placing them in a microwave oven. The oven set itself for the particular dish of food, and moments later, a cooked meal arrived. 

*** 

'Slave! Where are you?' Jimmy shouted. 

Riana almost ran to the study, hurrying to her master. At the door she caught a hold of her thoughts, wondering why she was thinking of the young shit as her master. She walked in, trying not to feel subservient, or reveal any emotion at all. 

'Master?' she said. 

'There's a party tonight. Just a few friends. You will be serving us. Drinks and food. Nothing fancy, just whatever is around. Make sure everything is ready by nine, slave,' he ordered. 

'Yes, master,' she politely responded. 

She hurried back to the kitchen. Damn! It was nasty enough serving this young boy, and now his damnable friends would see her. She made a note to herself, to treat her own household servants better when she arrived home. As long as she kept out of his way, it would be possible to stand a week of this stupid situation. Anyway, he would be away on business after the weekend, so she could relax. With a bit of luck, she could be back home before her husband missed her. 

*** 

At first she felt embarrassed, over flouncing around in the naughty outfit, among young men. They made the inevitable rude remarks, then settled down to talking about themselves, to each other. The occasional pat of her bottom surprised her every time, but she ignored the rudeness. 

One of the guests slid a hand up her thigh, to twang a suspender strap. Both hands were occupied with a drinks tray, so she was helpless to intervene. The thought of braining him with the tray was curtailed, knowing she would have to clear up the mess. Perhaps it was the certainty that her master would spank her, most likely in front of everyone, that stopped her. 

'Slave, these two want your opinion on a range of chocolates they're developing. Charley, she's all yours,' Jimmy said. 

Riana was nervous when they entered the study. The young man had promised not to use her, but promised nothing about his friends. A fear of over the idea of being used by these two young men almost overcame her. With great relief she saw boxes of chocolates laid out on the desk. 

'We want you to taste them, and provide your opinion,' one of them said. 

'Yes, they are flavours we are developing, and want a woman's opinion. Do you mind?' Charley asked. 

'You're asking me to eat chocolates? Of course I don't mind,' she said. 

The tension was released, and she laughed, probably for the first time since arriving at that house. Of course she was prepared, and more than happy to co- operate. Charley picked up a notepad and tapped the screen. 

*** 

A day earlier Riana's husband arrived home to find the house empty, or at least, devoid of staff. He contacted their summer cabin, and found the household slave was there. He signed on to the government system, entered the main residence as her authorised destination, and arranged for a vehicle to collect her. 

The rest of the servants quickly arrived when summoned. 

At least now he could eat, with the house back to normal functioning. He wondered why Jimmy hadn't taken the slave as arranged. Reading through messages he found Jimmy hadn't signed the financial contract. Perhaps he was going to send for the slave after signing the contract. 

Next morning he wondered where Riana was, as she hadn't arrived home. He contacted friends, but no one had seen her, or heard from her. 

'Any idea where my wife is?' he asked a servant. 

'I last saw her here, yesterday, sir. She gave us the day off. Said something about wanting to be home alone with you sir, when you arrived home,' the butler informed him. 

Adrian asked, 'What time did she send you away?' 

The butler said it was early yesterday morning. He dismissed the butler, to think over the possibilities. 

The only reason someone would vanish with twenty-second century communications, was to do something illegal, or have an illicit affair. He didn't deserve that, despite them drifting apart. Jimmy had borrowed his slave, yet she was here at the main residence. He summoned her to his study. 

'Did Jimmy want to borrow you for the week?' he asked. 

'I don't know who Jimmy is, sir, but no one asked me, master,' Bella politely spoke. 

'You are dismissed, go find something to do,' he told her. 

He skimmed through the security system images, looking for the kitchen, at the time he phoned home, and found Jimmy. He slowed the video down to examine it. Riana was standing in the corner, looking nervous. 

'What in hell is she wearing? What is she playing at?' he murmured. 

He watched her leave with Jimmy, and realised she was wearing a slave sirik. Was she playing a sexy game with Jimmy, or was it all a horrendous mistake. He couldn't determine the expression on her face, so it was difficult to tell. There was only one way to settle this, and that was to go and see Jimmy. 

'I'm in trouble. I'm not sure why, but know I am,' he mused. 'Why would my wife pretend to be a slave? Why would she then go along with being loaned to Jimmy?' 

He had always been impetuous, except in business when he was always considering and analysing a situation. 

'Riana has always been such a stickler for protocol, and gets easily embarrassed by mistakes. She has a stubborn streak too,' he said, to the empty room. 

He knew she thought it important not to give gossips anything to talk about. She was highly regarded in society, even though she kept a low profile. She would protect that reputation fiercely. He told himself that was the reason she walked out with Jimmy. But why was she dressed like a slave in the first place? 

*** 

Jimmy spotted Adrian walk in to the atrium. He greeted him, and waved the man up to the balcony, overlooking the library door. 

'Hi Adrian, glad you could make it. You look worried, any problems?' he politely asked. 

He arrived at Jimmy's home surprised to find a sedate party in progress. It was a nuisance as he needed to talk privately to the young man. 

'I need to talk to you, about the slave you borrowed,' Adrian said. 

'I'm afraid she's busy right now. Entertaining a couple of my friends,' Jimmy carefully spoke. 

So he had taken away a slave, but that didn't mean it was his wife. Adrian realised what he had suggested, and looked at him with disbelief. The young man had promised to look after her, and not use her. Within the strict contract conditions, he wasn't using her, his friends were. No! That couldn't be so. His wife would surely refuse. Why on earth she had gone away with Jimmy, he still had no idea, yet she had. How far was she willing to go with this damnable lark. 

'Where is she?' Adrian urgently asked. 

'In the library,' Jimmy said, purposely looking worried. 

On cue, Riana stepped through a doorway into the atrium. 

'Here she is now,' he said. 

Adrian was relieved as it wasn't his wife after all. There must be some mistake, as there was no way she would wear a saucy French maids' outfit. When she turned his way, he felt weak. She hadn't seen him on the balcony, overlooking the library door. Two young men stepped out, and began talking to her. She had a big grin on her face. 

Other guests went quiet, and stared at the saucily dressed woman. There was a look of lust in their eyes, with the thought that she was a household slave, and might be available. 

Adrian didn't like the way the young men were looking at his wife. She was a married woman, not some slut they could ogle. The two who followed her out of the library, were whispering in her ear, and she was laughing. What on earth had gotten into her? He hoped it wasn't those two. 

'There's some mint cream on your lips,' Charley whispered. 

Riana scooped something white and sticky from the corner of her mouth, with a finger. She licked the finger with eyes closed, looking pleased with herself. 

'Mmmm, your cream is lovely. That was the best time I've had in ages. Thank you both for having me, sirs,' she lavishly spoke. 

The chocolates were delicious, though Charley and his friend couldn't take the credit for that. They brought them to the party to work a favour for Jimmy. 

The acoustics of the tiled atrium brought her words up to where her husband stood. Jimmy was pleased with the effect, having positioned Adrian in just the right place. He'd kept Adrian talking, hoping his friends timing would be effective. 

'It looks as though she was happy to oblige,' Jimmy smiled. 'A very accomplished slave. Is she for sale?' 

Adrian was disgusted. His wife was sucking on a finger, grinning, after wiping someone's cum from her face. Why on earth was she behaving like a disreputable slut. She didn't know he was here, so it wasn't just an act of retribution. He'd been too busy lately to pay her much attention, but this was ridiculous. How could she have sex with two young strangers? She's a married woman, his woman, not some sexed-up trollop. 

'Adrian, is your slave for sale?' Jimmy again asked. 

'Slave? For sale? Yes, damn it! You can keep her!' Adrian said, through gritted teeth. 

The silences and nagging he put up with, but he didn't deserve this. Infidelity was going too far. Committing it with two young men was obscene. He stormed off, to find transport. An auto-car was parked outside ready to take him home. He jumped in, and ordered it to leave. Sitting back while the auto-pilot found the best route home, he regretted the sudden decision. 

Jimmy laughed with relief when Adrian stormed out. Adrian was spoilt and impetuous, from growing up in a wealthy privileged family. Much like himself, he had to admit. It was a complete contrast to Adrian's business reputation, for prudence and patience. 

Riana enjoyed herself at the party, despite having to wait on the guests. Dressed as a naughty French maid, she received a lot of male attention. The flattery was heady, making it a pleasure to serve them. She felt young and attractive, after a year of feeling old and discarded. 

*** 

Next morning Jimmy was pleased to hear his maid tidying up after the party. She was singing to herself, a little out of tune, yet sounding happy. She brought him breakfast, and even managed to smile. If she was younger, he would consider keeping her for himself. 

In the office he phoned an acquaintance, who owed him a big favour. Eduardo promised to be there later that day. 

Riana walked into the office, and curtsied, asking, 'May your maid clean in here, sir?' 

'Try not to make a noise, I'm busy,' he said. 

He went back to re-configuring the investment plan. Give it a few days and he would reject Adrian's offer. A business rival of Adrian's was going to be approached, with an offer that couldn't be refused. The slave would be a part of the deal. He needed to make sure the investment was received, or all that had been worked for would be lost. His father insisted that he survive on his own efforts, and he was determined to do so. 

He watched his new slave busying herself in the office, straightening pictures and dusting. As directed she avoided making a noise. He was surprised she agreed to be loaned out to him. Of course Adrian would calm down and demand her back, though later this morning it would be too late. 

Jimmy watched her bend over in the short skirt, and began to feel a stirring. She had a fine figure. Nice large breasts over a slim waist were noticed first. Nice shapely legs were next, especially when the stocking tops and suspenders were on show. 

A beautiful face was framed by long blond hair. He thought her long neck would be enhanced if she had her hair up. There would be time to shape her to his requirements. 

Eduardo turned up on time. Jimmy briefed him in the office, and he reluctantly agreed to the subterfuge. 

'They're up to all kinds of tricks to rob the rich. I don't blame them, but it's my job to ensure they keep within government rules,' Eduardo explained. 

'Maid, come here,' Jimmy shouted. 

'How may I serve you, sir,' Riana asked. 

It was a change from the usual old daily routine, of meeting friends for coffee, and attending committee meetings. She wasn't working hard, and this was something new to experience. She had to admit, taking orders from a handsome young man, was interesting. When he wasn't looking she studied him, noting his cute bottom, and strong tapering shoulders. It was interesting exploring his home, not from being nosey, it was just something new to explore. 

'Eduardo is here to remove the chains,' Jimmy told her. 

'Yes, sir,' she readily agreed. 

The chains were a damnable nuisance, especially when she showered. 

'Hop up onto the desk, and he'll take a look,' Jimmy told her. 

He helped her up, where she tried to recline as modestly as possible. Told to rest flat, she did so. The man inspected the sirik chains, which led from the collar to wrists, and ankles. It had been a little over the top, wearing it for her husband, but it was all a part of the set. When she'd been dragged from home in a hurry, there hadn't been an opportunity to fetch the keys. 

The man tightened the chains, so they pulled her wrists and ankles together. Her eyes opened wide with fright. 

'Relax, I need to get some slack in the chains,' Eduardo firmly told her. 

She opened her mouth to complain, and choked, when a gag was stuffed into her mouth. Jimmy had taken her by surprise from behind. The man buckled a strap around a wrist, then the other was strapped to the desk. She yelled ineffectively through the gag. The noise was loud enough for the man to slap her legs. 

The leather straps had been in place ready for her. This recognition was scary. Two more wrapped her ankles, so she was firmly secured against the desk top. The chains were slackened, and she began to thrash around, screaming. It was no good, she couldn't get free. 

A spreader bar was secured to her thighs, and her panties were cut off. She screamed louder, not caring if he slapped her again. She was going to be raped by these two men. A scream was cut off, as her whole body collapsed from fear. 

'As you thought, these papers don't match the slave. Different dimensions, age, and everything. The slave doesn't even have a registration number tattoo. As soon as the payment is made to its government account, it will be off to dupe someone else,' Eduardo explained. 

With a hand-held machine pressed against her shoulder, a sharp click sounded. Riana screeched through the gag, from a sharp sting. 

'It's not so bad as all that,' Eduardo laughed. 

'These tattoos and identity chip can be removed, with difficulty. Another is needed to make sure. Hold it still,' he told Jimmy. 

Eduardo pulled on a vagina lip, and pressed the machine against it. 

This time Riana loudly screeched. She tugged at her chains, desperately trying to reach her sex. It stung more than the shoulder, like a dozen bee stings. 

She started crying, and Jimmy wiped away the tears. If she could have, she would have bitten his hand. It was some small comfort that they weren't going to rape her. They thought she was a slave, so were marking her with a slave number. It was perfectly reasonable, except she wasn't a slave. She was only pretending, after being mistaken for one. She tried to tell them, only the gag made it impossible.  

===

All this pain was for nothing. She would phone her husband and demand he collect her. It no longer mattered about the shame of being discovered, not after this indignity. 

'The chip is permanently in place now. The slave will be fully registered in a few minutes. It won't be able to run then. The police detect slaves if they're away from the registered abode without permission. You must remember that too. Don't take it out, without entering the destination into the government system,' he reminded Jimmy. 

'I'll take that old pack, and leave you a brand new set of slave documents. So, you are now officially the owner of a slave. Look after it,' Eduardo advised. 

Riana heard them talking about her, and froze. Was this true? There was no reason for them to lie to her, or play a practical joke. It felt real when they marked her lip down there. Oh hell! If true, she wouldn't be able to leave this house without permission. It would be awkward phoning her husband to take her home. 

It looked as though she was this young man's slave, until she could find a way out of the mess. Oh! God! What a stupid thing to do, pretending to be a slave! If her husband hadn't lent her to him, none of this would have happened. It was all his fault for not being careful, and buying a slave in the first place. 

Jimmy examined the tattoo on her shoulder, and the one between her legs, on a lip. Eduardo was right. It would be difficult to remove the tattoo, and the chip would be near impossible. Wherever she went, the chip would be detected, and her position noted. If she was out of the house and grounds without permission, the police would arrest her as a runaway slave. If he didn't want her back, she would be incarcerated, then sold to the highest bidder. 

The straps and gag were removed, yet Riana just lay still, too weak to move. Tears ran down her cheeks, onto the desk. 

'You can get down now, slave,' Jimmy said. 

Ever so slowly she moved off the desk, onto unsteady feet. It was no longer a bit of fun, a diversion from a humdrum life. She felt as though she really was a slave. Technically and legally she was a slave, this young man's slave. What other standards were there to be judged on? Nothing came to mind, so she must be a slave. 

Oh! Shit! She was completely at this arrogant bastard's mercy. He owned her, and could do anything he wanted with her. He'd proved that, by tattooing her pussy! 

'Yes, slave?' 

'Permission to speak, master,' she humbly spoke. 

'Go ahead,' he sighed. 

'Did my, err, master, Adrian, mention when I am to return to him,' she asked. 

She would have to be careful not to slip up, and call Adrian her husband. There was a vague memory that once enslaved, all relationships were cancelled, together with all debts. It was the debts that made people volunteer to be slaves. The purchase price was held for them by the government, for the duration of their slave contract. It would be a nice start in life for someone with nothing, accept she was rich, and didn't need to sell herself. 

'Adrian has sold you to me. He saw you emerge from the library with those two friends of mine, and became angry. He must have thought you had been entertaining them. He stormed off, and left you with me. I settled the asking price this morning. A very reasonable price, as it seemed he wanted to get rid of you,' Jimmy said. 

Riana was stunned. 

'Run along with you, and get busy. Don't forget! If you run away, the police will fetch you back. I won't be pleased to pay their fee. I'll only pay the once,' he warned. 

He slapped her bare ass, under the short dress, to send her on her way. 

In the kitchen she sat drinking coffee, wondering what in hell she could do. There hadn't been a lecture at finishing school on such a horrible situation. How to treat servants and slaves had been thoroughly covered, but not how to get out of being a registered slave. She called up information on the computer, reading up on the calamity. 

After an hour, she hadn't the slightest idea what to do. She was more firmly convinced that she was a slave, and could do nothing about it. Once registered with the government, that was it. She checked her name on file and found her photograph. Vital statistics, distinguishing marks, and other embarrassing things were recorded. 

A lawyer might advise her and find a loophole in the law. Though a reliable lawyer wouldn't take on a penniless slave. That's something else she found out. As a slave she no longer owned anything at all, nothing. Everything, including her, her panties, and what was in them, was owned by her master. 

Her master was an arrogant young man, and she would have to obey him, or feel his anger. Obeying a young man, as his lowly slave after having a pampered life style, was a horrendous prospect. 

Reading the contract was the worst moment of her life. More hurtful than the tattoo. There were no restrictions in the contract, which meant Jimmy could do whatever he wanted with her. Anything! 

The tears in her eyes clouded everything else out. Obviously her husband had left the contract, and all the details to, Jimmy. He'd been so angry with her, he just washed his hands of her. She remembered wiping that cream off her lips, and imagined what it must have looked like. He was an idiot when it came to relationships, and thinking of others. 

When he came to collect her, she would make him pay for this. She reckoned he was regretting the decision already. It would take him a few hours to gather the courage to back down, and confront Jimmy. He would have to pay Jimmy dearly to get her back, and that would only be a small part of her retribution. 

Instead of being awkward, she would be a co-operative and valuable slave. That would put her price up to Adrian. She figured he would be phoning later this evening, or by the latest tomorrow morning.  

===

Recovering his wife 

As Riana expected, her husband phoned Jimmy that morning. Adrian would sort out this dire problem and take her home, before Jimmy found out she wasn't a household slave. It would cause all kinds of unpleasantness, if he found out she was Adrian's wife. He could use it to re-negotiate the loan Adrian arranged for him. Much worse for her, would be the social indignity of being a slave, even for just a day. 

The gossip and sniggers from social acquaintances would be intolerable. A person only signed up as a slave out of desperation, and therefore it was a social and personal disgrace. 

A global collapse of world economies in twenty-one-fifty, left a lot of people without work, and the government couldn't afford to even feed them all. Those with skills were lucky to find employment, with a corporation, or as a household servant. 

The rest had to sign on with the government as a slave. In return, their debts were written off. In addition they had the purchase price to start a new life, once freed. A major problem was the government didn't have enough inspectors, so checking a master was keeping a slave within the regulations, was hardly ever done. This led to a general acceptance that slaves could be miss-used. 

Riana new this, and was worried. She listened to the conversation between her husband and Jimmy, becoming angrier as her husband stalled, and the deal didn't progress very far. 

Her husband couldn't take the chance of upsetting Jimmy, while she was held as a slave. The situation was extremely delicate. Jimmy wanted to borrow the household slave a couple of days ago, and her husband agreed. The guy had mistakenly taken Riana, instead of the slave. 

'We made a deal. I borrow the slave for a week, and accept the business loan offer. Then you turn up and tell me to keep the slave. I sent the agreed purchase price to the government account, so the deal is done. Now you want the slave back. What's happened?' Jimmy asked. 

'It was a mistake reacting without consideration. Look, I'll give you twenty percent more than you paid for her. It will recompense you for any inconvenience,' Adrian offered. 

'I still need the slave for a week, to fulfil the government regulations. Why don't we take time to consider the situation, and settle this at the end of the week?' Jimmy pushed the point. 

He was sure a lot more could be squeezed out of the man, if he tried. His plans precluded that, and would be far more profitable than a few percent extra. Also, there would be a great deal of satisfaction to be had, by keeping the slave for a while. 

'If you think the offer is too low, just tell me,' Adrian said, sounding rattled. 

'It's not that. I really do need to keep it until the end of the week. We can talk then. I don't think I'll need anything extra, just the credits back,' Jimmy said, and smiled at the screen. 

'Well, if you change your mind, let me know,' Adrian said. 

Adrian rang off and sat holding his face in both hands. Mistakenly thinking Riana had sex with a couple of Jimmy's friends, he'd angrily told him to keep her. Now he had to negotiate with a selfish young man, for the return of his wife. Damn! Damn! Damn! It wasn't his fault for getting into this impossible position. It was Riana's fault for going off with the arrogant young man. 

It was unbearable knowing another man owned his wife as a slave. The infuriating situation was that his hands were tied from not being able to reveal who she was. Obviously she was alright, otherwise she would have simply come home. Didn't she know how difficult this was for him? 

Jimmy thought the man looked tired and strained. Well that served him right. Adrian had lost his father a lot of credits, and expected him to continue investing. Adrian had also refused to invest in Jimmy's project. The man was heartless. Jimmy couldn't inflict financial pain, so this was the only way to kick him where it hurt. 

Riana listened to their conversation, which on the surface sounded civilised and ordinary. The stupid bastard hadn't tried hard enough to get her back! What did he think he was doing, leaving her with this young man, as a slave? This was no way to treat a wife! 

As soon as her husband took her home, she would find a way to remove the tattoo's, and micro-chips. The ring piercing her nether lips would be the first to go. Why that had been done, she had no idea. 

'Did you hear that, slave? Your old master wants you back. Let's have a look at what I've bought, slave,' Jimmy demanded. 

Riana looked at him, wondering what he meant, until it struck her. He was waiting for her to strip! 

'Master, may your slave speak?' she quietly asked. 

The only way to deal with this arrogant young man was to be self-effacing. He enjoyed putting her in place, so she determined not to give him an excuse. He'd made it clear, that behaving herself would avoid a punishment. 

'Go ahead, slave,' he said. 

'Your slave is a mature woman, and it will be hurtful being naked in her master's presence. Please, master, may your respectful slave keep her clothes on,' she demurely asked. 

Only after speaking did she realised the words had an effect upon her, as well as him. She felt lowly, as though she really were nothing more than his humble slave. Waiting for a decision, whether to strip or not, was deepening that lowly position. 

'If you don't undress, I'll cut the clothes off, and leave you naked. Get them off now, slave,' he fiercely ordered. 

The strength of purpose, and anger directed at her, moved her hands. As though on automatic, she quickly pulled off the apron and cap, then unzipped the dress. When it dropped to the floor she stepped out of it, picked it up, and neatly folded it. Her panties had already been cut off, so there was no protection to her private place. 

She struggled with the bra, wriggling around while he looked on. She bent to the stockings, carefully smoothing them down her legs, so as not to damage them. Pulling the garter belt around her waist, she unhooked it, and laid it on the pile of clothes. They weren't even her clothes, they were her master's possessions, just as she had become. 

The significance of this pushed heavily upon her, and she swayed a little. What if he denied her clothes? She was his to do with as he wished, and he was looking her over. A strong realisation that she needed to please him, swamped her mind. She stood before him, almost at attention, with arms to her sides. 

She still wore the slave chains, connected to a slave collar. Having a slave number branded upon her body, affected her profoundly. Her confidence and self- esteem had shrunk to nothing. Her head hung low, with a feeling of deep shame. She stood with thighs pressed together, trying to hide her sex. 

'If you displease me, you will be punished, slave,' he heavily stated. 

'Yes, master,' she breathed. 

For the first time since being there, those words came naturally, and were full of meaning. She kept reminding herself this was no fantasy, conjured up to satisfy sexual needs. Being naked before this young man was demeaning, and it was unaccountably exciting. At that moment there was little of the haughty, sophisticated woman left to degrade. 

A deep feeling overcame her, that this was no longer just a silly mistake. She was dependent upon this young man for absolutely everything. Her whole wellbeing would depend upon his whims. She felt lightheaded. 

It must have only been a brief moment when her consciousness flickered out. He saw her swaying, and grabbed a hold before she fell. Her eyes flickered open, to see him studying her. He was sitting on a chair, on top of her folded clothes. She was sitting on his lap, naked. 

'You all right? You fainted,' he said. 

'Think so,' she said, and moved to slip off his lap. 

He strengthened his grip, and said, 'Sit for a moment. I'll get you a drink in a moment. It must be all the excitement,' he smiled. 

Her bare bottom was on his lap, and her breasts were pressed against his shirt. A look of embarrassment crossed her face, and she quickly pulled her legs together. She'd been too relaxed, showing off everything while out of it. It didn't feel as though he'd taken advantage. 

'How long was I out?' she asked. 

'Seconds, maybe only one. Saw you ready to drop, so I grabbed you, and sat down,' he said. 

'I'm alright now,' she whispered. 

'You sure? I don't mind holding you for a little while,' he grinned. 

'Oh. Well, yes, I'll try and stand,' she said. 

'If you're well, you had better call me master, or be punished,' he stated. 

'Sorry, master,' she quietly spoke. 

The last time she sat on someone's lap, was being comforted on her father's knee. Since then she hadn't sat on a man's knee, not even with her husband. Being held close brought back warm memories of being cared for. He was a young man, and she was naked, so the feeling was absurd. He had his arms around her, asking if she was alright, so maybe that brought on the feeling of being wanted. 

Riana leant her head on his chest, and sighed. 

'Open your legs, I want to see if you're healing,' he told her. 

The sentimental mood turned to embarrassment as she complied. She felt a finger gently run across her lips. He prodded the ring through her lips, turning it into an ordeal. They still throbbed, but not so painfully now. It was an awful way to treat her naughty bits. 

'You look alright. If there are signs of infection or swelling, let me know,' he calmly told her. 

'Thank you, master,' she quietly spoke. 

Thanking him for examining her private place was so very wrong! No one should be doing that! More telling than anything, was calling him master. Thanking him for touching her down there and calling him master, was a sign of how she was beginning to think of him. It was a bad sign. 

'I'd better get you some panties. There's sure to be something suitable upstairs,' he smiled at her. 

'Thank you, master,' she said. 

This time the words were said while trying not to feel so humble. Just saying them without meaning would help keep her mind straight. He wasn't making a move, and neither did she. She turned her head toward him, to ask permission to stand. 

Their faces were close, and the request faltered. He kissed her gently on the lips. She opened her mouth to protest, and he kissed her deeply. For a moment she froze, not wanting this. He was kissing her, but she refused to respond. 

A mature married woman couldn't let a young boy kiss her. Sitting on his lap, naked, it was no wonder he wanted her. He wanted her! The feeling of being wanted had been lacking in her life for such a long time. An ache formed within her mind and body. 

Opening her mouth, she willingly let him in. Hardly aware of it, a hand cupped a breast, and began to gently caress it. Ever so slightly, she parted her legs. Fingers stroked her thighs, while she let him take her with his tongue. Their tongues intertwined, exploring and teasing. His hands were exploring her body, with meaningful strokes. The message was that he wanted her! 

Her eyes were clamped shut, as they sank to the floor, with him holding her tight. The movement couldn't be denied, though purposely avoiding what it meant was just possible. She felt his hand slipping between her thighs. Only then did she realise how available and wet she had become. 

Her master wanted her, and as a slave it was impossible to deny him her body. At that moment it was a valid excuse, and not a thought was given to the next moment, for she was living for the second. With every touch, every caress of lips and hands, was engulfing her in the fantasy of being nothing more than a helpless slave. Too far gone, she was helpless to resist. Her master was taking her, and she wanted to submit. 

'Yes, master, oh, yes!' she heavily breathed, on feeling him enter. 

The sensation of him slowly pushing into her, was wonderful. He was young, handsome, strong, and virile. She felt the power of his thrust reaching deep inside. As his penis touched the entrance to her womb, she whimpered. Pulling back left her vagina sensitive, and wanting more. 

The strokes came faster. They were deep and powerful, from strong thigh muscles pushing hard. Her face screwed up as though in agony, and she bit her lip. There was nothing she could do to hold back. 

'Fuck your slave, master! Fuck your slave hard!' she yelped. 

Her master pushed deep, and held still. Already into an orgasm, on feeling his cock stiffen and jerk, another orgasm overtook her. Imagining his red hot young cum spurting deep into her body, pushed along the orgasm into a deeper more satisfying climax. As she was about to slip into a comfortable afterglow, it unexpectedly continued. A third orgasm rippled through her body, tingling her fingers and toes. 

She stretched her limbs out, spread-eagled on the floor, with a smile spreading across her face. Completely sated, she lay back next to him, feeling weak and happy. He scooped her into his arms, to balance her on his chest. He pulled her up to his face, and kissed her. She languidly kissed him back, enjoying his every touch. She was his, now completely won over. 

Knowing her mood was dominated by the afterglow of a powerful orgasm, didn't negate the idea that she was his slave. It cut sharply through her being, imprinted upon her soul, as permanently as the tattoos. She was a slave, and had to serve him with all her ability. She pulled her lips away from his face, to look closely at the man who bought her. 

'Thank you for the orgasms, master,' she whispered. 

These were the words she whispered on a lonely night, pleasuring herself, and at that moment they seemed so right. This was a powerful statement describing what she sincerely felt. He was her master. He'd bought and paid for her, marked her with a slave number, inserted a slave chip, and taken her. She was his slave, body and soul. 

'Do you promise to serve me as a dutiful slave?' he asked. 

'Yes, master, your slave promises to server her master in all things, as a dutiful slave should,' she quietly and earnestly spoke. 

'Good slave girl. In return your master promises to dominate you, and direct you in all things. You will do as you are told, or be punished. Do you understand, slave?' he asked. 

'Your slave girl understands, master. Slave girl will be punished for disobedience,' she acknowledged. 

He kissed her lips, and playfully slapped a bare cheek. 

His deep voice penetrated her being, overawing her. It wasn't surprising that she found herself thoroughly believing she was his slave. Not just the sex had her reeling, it was the accumulation of events. A slave fantasy, tattooed with a number, being treated like a possession, and mounted like a slut, left her thinking like a slave. 

In the afterglow of multiple orgasms, her life as a rich married woman became a blur. The life of an unhappy wife, was replaced by a happy slave, peacefully accepting her position. There was no longer a pressure to conform with a privileged societies mores. All she had to do was obey her master, and all would be well in this new world. 

Riana found it difficult to shake off the idea of being owned. It was so comforting being this caring man's object of desire, she embraced the warm feeling. After all, her husband had sold her, enslaving her, and so he would have to undo the mistake. Her husband had rejected her for so long, a week of happiness was deserved. Clearing her mind of these thoughts later, would be soon enough. 

He stood up towering over her. She looked up, feeling small and vulnerable, as though she were a little girl again, needing to be looked after by a big strong man. 

'On hands and knees,' Jimmy ordered. 

She struggled up, wondering what he was going to do with her next. He grabbed the chain dangling from the collar. 

Having sex with her just happened on the spur of the moment. It wasn't part of his plans. The warm feelings developing for her had to be checked, or he might not be able to go through with the training. 

'Come on, slave,' he said. 

She crawled naked across the soft carpet, with his hand grasping the chains, guiding her. He sat behind the desk, and looked her over. 

'Slave will practice different positions, and learn to take them up when ordered. When your master says crawl, this is the position. Remember it, or be punished, slave,' he firmly stated, and smiled down at her. 

Riana couldn't help glancing at him with a look of admiration. She was contentedly kneeling at his feet, awaiting his pleasure. She knew this was all wrong, though what could she do? A feeling of belonging to him was overpowering her common sense. After having sex, she knew what the rest of the week held in store for her. It should have been a dire prospect, yet she was vibrating with anticipation. 

She kneeled with both heels under bottom, head bowed, and hands on her thighs, palm upwards. Keeping her back straight, to push out her breasts was difficult. She had to keep this position, squatting at his feet, while he worked. 

Eventually he lifted her chin, forcing her to look at him. He smiled, and stroked her hair. 

'When I tell you to squat, this is the position you must take. Now learn to present. Turn around. Neal, and lean forward with both hands flat on the floor. Spread your feet and hands wide. Push your bottom up, that's it,' he congratulated her. 

Displaying her naked body was all very humbling, yet he had a way of making her feel it was an achievement. He went back to work, shuffling papers around on his desk. At least this position was easier to hold without trembling. All he had to do is glance at her, to see everything between her legs, but he didn't. The idea of taking up a slave position, helped push her further into a fantasy world of her own making. 

In her fantasy, she had been kidnapped from home by a powerful slave-master, and sold on to a master. Her master had taken her, despite her protestations. She was in chains, being trained to be an obedient slave girl. Trying to resist was hopeless. She was completely his, to do with as he saw fit. 

After awhile he directed her again. She turned around to face him on her knees, spread wide. She dipped her head forward, until her forehead touched the carpet. She would have to take up this position if her master said, kowtow. 

Two hours practising slave positions, being still, not daring to move, reinforced an acceptance of her slavery. She was being trained to submit, and couldn't, or didn't want to fight it. 

'You're a patient pet. A very beautiful slave and valuable indeed. Worth looking after with great care. You're voluptuous, and so very gorgeous, slave. Your master will keep you happy, my pet,' he softly spoke. 

'Squat!' he ordered. 

Riana squatted before him, as an obedient slave girl. He lifted her chin to gain her attention. She had a dreamy faraway look in her eyes. Her eyes opened wide showing she was back in the here and now, to find she really was a slave girl. 

They locked eyes, transmitting an understanding. Her master's voice was full of meaning, and brought tears to her eyes. She felt a droplet roll down a cheek, and splash onto a knee. After being cruelly neglected for so long, the idea of being valued reached into her soul. 

'Get under the desk, slave,' he ordered. 'Hurry up!' he cajoled her, and slapped her bottom. 

It was playful, not intended to hurt. A need to please him had her scurrying as ordered. She looked up between his legs, where he was looking down at her. Again she had the feeling of being a small thing, like a frail little bird, needing his protection. 

'Take out my cock, and suck it while I work,' he said. 

At that moment she felt foolish for not guessing why she was there. She hesitated, wondering if she could carry out such a demeaning task. Never before had she sucked on a man's penis. To avoid upsetting her master, she quickly undid his fly. Delving into his trousers was easier that doing nothing. Pulling out his penis, she found it shrivelled, and therefore less threatening.  

===

He looked down, and coaxed her, 'Come on, slave, get on with your duty.' 

'Yes, master,' she murmured. 

Sucking it into her mouth was easier than she thought. Rolling it around in her mouth wasn't the unpleasant chore she thought it would be. She pushed a hand into his trousers to feel his sack. Gentle strokes were called for, she knew that much. Not having performed this for anyone, not even for her husband, it should have been disgusting with a stranger. Instead she felt proud to be useful to her master. 

Jimmy was pleased with the way things were going. A continuous onslaught of reinforcement had her bowing to the inevitable. She'd accepted her position as slave, and acknowledged him as her master. Adrian wanted her back, but now she was registered as a slave, he couldn't just take her home. 

In her kitchen he'd recognised her, just before Adrian phoned. It was just a bit of fun telling Adrian he wanted to borrow a slave, yet she went along with it. Why she had was still a mystery. It probably had something to do with the fantasy slave outfit she'd been wearing. The plan had come together on the drive home, and it seemed to be working. 

Watching Adrian's wife sucking his hardening cock, brought on a feeling of power. He felt very pleased with himself, and was tempted to reveal he knew who she was. Not much technique, but she was thorough. It was impossible to ignore and hold back. 

'Can you swallow it, slave?' he gasped. 

Riana wondered what to do. She'd heard about taking it down the throat, but didn't know if that was possible. How could she swallow such a large object? Its head would choke her. It was bulging out a cheek when she sucked half of it into her mouth. 

Riana stopped sucking to look up at him. She let go of his cock, though still holding onto his scrotum. 

'Sorry, master. Your slave will practice later, to please her master,' she promised. 

She was on her knees, sucking his cock. She was rolling his balls in one hand, while stroking his cock with the other. The position should have been humiliating, instead, she felt ashamed for letting her master down. She was there to pleasure her master, and was found wanting. 

Knowing he was about to cum, she pulled back, knocking her head on the underside of the desk. Unable to manoeuvre in the cramped space, she clamped her eyes shut, while streams of sticky goo spattered her face. Her eyes flickered open to see her master looking down at her, with a look of disdain. This young man certainly had a potent weapon, as his sperm had exploded everywhere. 

'You made a mess, dirty slave girl,' he intoned. 

'Sorry, master,' she automatically responded. 

The bitter taste of his sperm was on her lips, and up her nose. Afraid to touch it, she let it dribble down her chin, onto her breasts. He sat back watching her crawl from the desk-well. When she tried to stand, he put a hand to her head, holding her down. 

'You've made a mess. Turn around and lick it up. Don't touch your face or tits, dirty little slave,' he ordered. 

Feeling incredibly small and insignificant, she didn't have the temerity to complain. It wasn't ill treatment for someone as lowly as she had become. Her master towered over her, watching her, while she licked under the desk. She'd never tasted cum before, and wondered if it all tasted the same. Though, this certainly wasn't something she wanted to trial. 

'Now my shoes,' he pointed out. 

Riana looked up at him from the floor, where he seemed ten feet tall, emphasising her lowly status. There was no need for tears, as this is what a slave must expect for disobedience. It was no good explaining this poor slave had never sucked a man's penis, and was frightened when it spurted hot cum over her. 

'Now get a sponge and a cloth for your master's trousers. Don't forget, don't wipe your body! Crawl, don't walk!' he crossly spoke. 

Crawling back as quickly as she could, his trousers were soon sponged and dried. Fortunately there was only a little around the cuffs, and it was soon removed. She felt happier now, having cleaned up her mistake, and forborne a just punishment. On her knees she pressed her forehead into the carpet, hoping for forgiveness. 

The rattle of a chain frightened her from a fantasy, where she was in a harem before a fierce sultan. She had transgressed his rules, and faced a dire punishment. 

'Stand up,' Jimmy told her. 'Legs a part,' he ordered, and slapped her bottom. 

Feeling him fiddling with the now healed ring, she guessed what was happening. Why though? Was this to be a further punishment? 

Jimmy stood up, and pulled on the chain. Riana felt it pull on her pierced lips, and yelped from the unexpected sensation. He said nothing, but obviously she had to follow him, or painfully damage her nether lips. In the kitchen he attached the chain to a weight sitting on the floor. There she had to stand, like it or not. On the counter next to her, he dumped some carrots. 

'Get practising with these, until I get back with something more suitable,' he told her. 

Riana had seen carrots before, in pictures. He must be one of those fad eaters, who wanted organic vegetables. Real ones grown in the ground rather than in nutrient pods. Picking one up, turning it around, she wondered what was to be done with it. 

'Oh!' she exclaimed. 

Not wanting to be caught slacking, she sucked on the carrot. After awhile she managed to get it to the back of her throat without choking. A little further and it felt as though her stomach was ready to heave. While spluttering and coughing, it was decided to try more gradually. Spit and snot slid down onto her chest, accumulating with her master's cum. 

She was just a dirty little slave girl, and needed to learn her master's whims, or suffer the consequences. The carrot became soft, and she managed to get it a little way down her throat. Reluctantly using a larger one, she started again. While on the third one her master arrived. 

'Here's something more realistic to try. Carry on with the carrots, until you can manage them,' he said. 'Well done, so far,' he conceded. 

Riana stared at the three rubber phalluses with a worried look on her face. They built up in size, with the last one as large as her master's penis. Comparing the carrot to the largest, she wondered how long it would take to manage the big brute. With greater urgency she pushed the smaller dildo into her mouth, and gently pushed at the back of her throat. The secret was to relax, and swallow. Not a natural action, but she was learning. 

Her master walked in while she had the smaller phallus down her throat. 

'How are you progressing? Very good, slave,' Jimmy smiled at her. 'Here's a bucket in case you need to pee,' he chuckled. 

The bucket was just within reach, but the prospect of urinating in a bucket was unpleasant. Knowing the inevitable would happen before the task was completed, made her feel worse, and added urgency to the assignment. The weight was impossible to lift, so she was stuck there until she completed her master's orders. 

With her whole body complaining from standing so long, she managed to push the big flexible dildo down her throat without retching. At last she allowed herself to squat over the bucket. The relief was satisfying. From emptying her bladder, as much as from fulfilling her master's order. 

While waiting for him to return, she practiced holding it in her throat as long as possible. Even knowing what this meant, she was still proud of the achievement. If her husband could see her now, he would be dumbfounded. The last time she had been so pleased with herself, was when she raised an enormous amount for a favourite charity. Now she was acting out a fantasy, as a slave slut, preparing herself to deep-throat a master. 

Burying herself into a fantasy world, as though none of this was real, enabled her to survive the ordeal. It also made her highly aroused all the time. Even now, tethered in the kitchen by a ring through her pussy lips, she was wet. 

Jimmy casually strolled in to see his slave's progress. Immediately she proudly demonstrated her new skill by swallowing the big dildo. She held it there for a moment then withdrew it to breath, repeating the process with enthusiasm. 

'Good slave girl!' he encouraged her. 

He handed her a key, and said, 'Unlock the chain, then thoroughly wash it. It's time for bed, so take a shower, and clean yourself up,' he said. 

Suddenly aware of the filth over her breasts and stomach, she felt terrible. She scuttled off to shower, then joined her master in bed. After standing for so long she was tired, and ready for bed, though sleep wasn't on his mind. Her master was ready to try out his slave's new trick. 

Riana was reticent over getting into bed with him. It was silly after having sex on the floor earlier, but this seemed more seriously intimate. 

'Bend over the bed, slave,' he ordered. 

'Oww! Sorry, master. Please master,' she cried. 

He only spanker her bare bottom with a few strokes, to have her capitulating. 

Unexpectedly Riana became turned on. Having been sexed up all day, this was just a heightening of the sexual tension. Justify getting into his bed, she told herself he was her master, and must be obeyed. As she climbed in, he pushed her head down, guiding her between his legs. She lay there for a moment, at the end of the bed. 

Her head was in his crotch, looking at his unready penis. This time there would be no mistakes, she would swallow his sperm. Nervously she sucked his cock into her mouth. Rolling it around in her mouth, it twitched, and began to grow. Carefully she pushed a hand between her legs. It was sad to realise she wasn't going to be ridden by her master. 

It didn't take long before he was fully erect. As practised she pushed her head down the full length of his penis. It felt tragically disappointing, having to play with her pussy while he enjoyed this. She began rhythmically bobbing her head up and down. She kissing his crotch with every downward stroke, and felt his balls touch her chin. On the upward stroke, she tightly sucked the head of his cock. 

'Stop!' Jimmy exclaimed. 

He pulled her up his chest, and told her, 'Ride my cock, slave.' 

With an ecstatic look in her eyes, she scrambled to place her knees either side of his thighs, and hovered over his cock. Her master laid back looking up at her. He had a smile of expectation on his lips. She bore down upon his penis, and he thrust up with powerful leg muscles, pushing deep into her. 

She'd never been in this position before, and it felt so wonderful, a cry of pleasure couldn't be held back. She bounced around on her master's cock, with her breasts gyrating. Her head was thrown back, gurgling an incompressible message. Up and down he thrust, lifting and dropping her. His penis felt strong and powerful, taking her, filling her with a completeness craved for. 

He suddenly stopped moving, and she felt his cock spasm. It was impossible to move, while he filled her vagina with thick potent sperm. She felt his cock pulsing at the entrance to her womb, shooting young virile sperm. 

'Oh, yes, master, fill your slave. Fill your slave with cum, master,' she cried out. 

Transfixed, unable to move, she imagined his sperm spurting right up inside her body, impregnating her. Her orgasm left her fragile. The afterglow weakened her mind, leaving her vulnerable. 

He slid her off to the side, and pulled her close. His heavy breathing in an ear tickled. Her whole body was sensitized, and his touch was electric. Nestled in his arms, tightly embracing her, she felt safe and desired. 

'You are my sexy slave girl, what are you?' he teased. 

'I'm your sexy slave girl, master,' she gladly agreed. 

'What will you do for your master?' he asked. 

'Anything my master desires. Slave is your obedient little slave girl, master,' she lovingly whispered. 

*** 

Next morning Riana worried over what she had done. Pangs of guilt stabbed at her all morning. She was a mature married woman, yet performed like a slut for a young man's pleasure. He was sixteen years younger than her, and he knew her husband. Fortunately he didn't know who she was, or her reputation would be in ruins. 

She had slipped from his bed, showered, and made coffee. She couldn't eat anything with a stomach clenching with fear. At least she was free of the madness that overtook her yesterday. In the night he'd woken her to take her mouth again. This time he spurted his sperm down her throat. She rubbed her tummy, imagining it full of sperm. 

When he walked in the kitchen she jumped up in surprise. She couldn't find any clothes, and was still naked. As had been instilled in her, she stood to attention, with arms at her sides. The only thing she could do was press her thighs together, to hide her sex. 

'Morning, slave. Well? Serve your master breakfast, slave,' he ordered. 

Riana needed to talk to him, and convince him to let her return home. This madness had to stop, before her wits were completely subsumed in a fantasy world. 

'Come here, slave,' he heavily sighed. 

It was important not to sit on his lap again, so she went to sit down on a chair. He grabbed a hand and pulled her close. 

Examining her, he said, 'You promised to obediently serve your master.' 

'Yes, master. But, I can't. . .' she started, unable to find the right words. 

She would have to tell him everything, despite the dire consequences. Maybe he would be kind enough to keep her secret. 

'You have no choice, slave,' he said. 

Jimmy pulled her over his knee. A familiar feeling of dizziness disorientated her, as the floor came up to meet her head. She felt a slap on her bare bottom. It wasn't until the second slap, that she felt a stinging pain. Her master was spanking her! She'd tried to defy him, and he was teaching her to be an obedient slave. 

'Sorry, master. Please don't hurt your slave girl! Please! Your slave promises to be a good little girl, master,' she shrieked. 

The years rolled back to when at home, being chastising by a strict father for being naughty. There had only been the one time he spanked her, but it left its mark upon her soul. She had been messing around with one of the servants, so her father dismissed the boy's father, and she never saw the boy again. That hurt more than the spanking. 

She stood before her master, rubbing her sore bottom. Tears rolled down her cheeks, from remembering the past, and from letting her master down. It felt just the same as when she had let her father down. 

'Please master, I mustn't, I can't,' she tried to say. 

'That's right, a slave mustn't disobey her master, and can't do anything without permission. Now, slave, do you understand your position in this house? Must I devise another punishment for this bad slave?' he demanded. 

'Sorry, master. Please, master, your slave knows her place. Your slave girl promises to be an obedient slave, honest master,' she blubbered. 

'Do you remember the slave positions?' he asked. 

'Yes, master,' she quickly answered, hoping she did. 

'Crawl,' he said. 

She got on hands and knees on the floor, sticking her bottom in the air. Next, she had to kneel, then present. It seemed terrible to be presenting her crotch to a young man in the kitchen. Her legs were spread wide, with her sex presented to him. 

Yesterday she had been in the afterglow of an orgasm, ready to serve his every whim. This morning she'd recovered and was painfully aware of what she was doing. She'd tried to tell him, but couldn't bring herself to defy this strong willed man. 

'Kowtow,' he said. 

She turned around, kneeled with knees parted, and bent her head to the floor. 

'Keep that position until your master leaves the room,' he ordered. 

He sat drinking a cup of coffee, looking her over. This woman had capitulated far easier than he thought she would, and he'd gone way too far with her last night. 

After breakfast in her kitchen that first morning, when sobering up, he recognised her as Adrian's wife. The fantasy slave outfit was worn for obvious reasons, and figured she was too embarrassed to admit who she was. When Adrian phoned, he watched her cringing in the corner, and thought to tease Adrian. When Adrian agreed to lend his slave, he saw the look of fear in Riana's face. Demanding she come with him as his slave, he was surprised, and amused when she did. 

On the drive to his house the idea of humiliating Adrian formed. He would treat the man's wife like a slave, and show her off in public. Even selling her to one of Adrian's business rivals was considered. 

After last night, he had second thoughts about selling her. Adrian's wife hadn't robbed his father, so why make her suffer. Intently looking over her voluptuous body brought on an idea of keeping her. Was he going soft over her? Of course that was out of the question, he couldn't keep another man's wife as his slave. 

They spent a quiet day together, with him honing his project plan, while she was busy in the house. No ornaments were broken as she became used to being a servant. She stopped for a coffee, and wondered at how ordinary all this had become. She was in a young man's house, naked, except for an apron and slave chains. Looking at the clock she realised his coffee break was due. 

Riana walked into her master's office balancing a coffee pot, milk, and cup, on a silver tray. The apron had been discarded, leaving her naked. According to her master's wishes, her hair was pinned up to enhance the elegance of her neck. 

'Your coffee, master,' she calmly spoke. 

Was this humble approach taken so as to avoid a punishment. There was a indication of other motives at play. Pushing her breasts out at him, a feeling of wanting him to notice her, and a tingling in her tummy, all added up to being enamoured of him. After all, he was a handsome young man, and he'd taken her. She'd opened up to him like no other. Not that she had any experience of men, except her husband. 

It wasn't love she felt, it was some kind of commitment, a result of being bedded by him. 

'Put that on the desk, and come here, slave,' he said. 

Riana stood by him, wondering what she had done wrong since breakfast. It was hoped he wouldn't make her perform those humiliating slave positions. He patted his lap and her heart sank, from the thought of being spanked. 

'Sit,' he said. 

She gingerly parked her bare bottom on his suit trousers, hoping she hadn't started to leak. Receiving a humiliating punishment this morning brought on an unexpectedly arousal, and the thought another spanking made her wet. That in itself was humiliating. He put his arms around her and turned her face to him, with a firm grip upon her chin. 

'My slave has performed her duties well today. Your master is very pleased with his slave,' he smiled. 

'Thank you, master,' she beamed brightly. 

'Good slave. The end of the week is approaching, when you return to your old master. I want you to think about staying here with me, as my slave,' he said. 

'Oh!' is all she could say. 

Did he really want her? Maybe he felt the same way she did. Do men also become attached to a woman after sex? 

He gently kissed her lips, her eyes, her nose, until her whole face was being smothered with kisses. Instead of just having sex, they might make love this time. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him back. His lips kissed their way down her neck, to her breasts. He carefully sucked on a nipple, while his finger tips stroked her back. 

She pushed her breasts into his mouth. Before sitting on his lap she was aching for his touch, and now the need was being fulfilled. One moment they were sitting, the next they were on the floor, writhing with pure pleasure. Heavy breathing was all that broke the silence, as they explored each others' body. Clothes were peeled away exposing skin to caress.  

===

Jimmy kissed and licked his way down her body. Over her tummy, down to her sex, he smoothly caressed her bare flesh. Finger tip touches to her thighs were light and sensitive. He licked her lips, and nipped her engorged bud. When she felt his tongue push into her, she yelped with ecstasy. It flicked inside her, rolling around, exploring. 

She arched her back, wanting more, needing more. This time they were making love. At least so far he was making love to her. Her hands grabbed his broad shoulders and pulled. She wanted him and must have him now. The journey up her body was swift. In one steady movement he was on top of her, and his cock penetrated. 

She wrapped her legs around his hips and pulled with both heels. The need to be filled was great and urgent. He began to push deeply into her, pushing at the walls of her vagina, filling her entire body with cock. 

'Yes, master, oh, yes! Fill your slave, master,' she huffed and puffed. 

The slow pumping of powerful leg muscles suddenly stopped. He was pumping her full of hot young sperm. She could almost feel jets of potent sperm hitting the entrance to her womb. She cried out, sounding in pain, only it was from an orgasm hitting her hard. Her entire body shook, her heels drummed on the floor. Just as suddenly, it subsided into a warm feeling of well being. She wanted to hold him, but her limbs seemed so heavy, they fell to the floor. She was exhausted, sated, bathing in glorious feelings of love. 

He wrapped his arms around her, holding her tightly to his chest. They lay there for a long time, wanting to say how they felt, only too afraid to open up. 

*** 

All good things come to an end, and a week passes so quickly when you're having fun. 

It left Jimmy secretly wondering about her. While he was training her to be a slave, was she subtly training him to be the master she wanted him to be. Despite his intensions he'd become fond of her. He no longer just looked at the beautiful voluptuous figure, it was the inner woman that he now saw, and liked. 

Riana wondered if being a slave, really meant a freedom to misbehave. A strong handsome young man had been making love to her, giving her so many orgasms her head was in a spin. She would never forget this wonderful week playing out a favourite fantasy. 

They were both used to her being naked, wearing just a sirik. The morning of the last day was muted. Both of them were quiet, coming to terms with the end of an interesting experience. 

He kept it quiet that he knew who she was, and that he had a mad idea of selling her. Selling Adrian's wife to a business rival, seemed like a cunning retribution, but now he knew her as a person, it was impossible. He examined her while she served coffee. There was so much more to her than being a slave and a sex object. He smiled at her. 

'Master?' she said, with a coy look upon her face. 

'I know what you're thinking, and the answer is no,' he laughed. 

'Was I thinking that, master,' she queried. 

Her head was held to one side, trying to be coy. She licked her lips, and looked more sultry than innocent. 

'You're to go back to your, err, master,' he reminded her. 

'Yes, master,' she acknowledged. 

He was pleased to see a lack of enthusiasm. Maybe she was suppressing the emotion, as a well trained slave should. It had only been a week, yet Adrian's wife had succumbed to his training. Though, he couldn't take complete credit for her being so well trained. It soon became obvious he was satisfying a slave and master fantasy of hers. Otherwise, she wouldn't have so readily had sex with him. On this very floor had been the first time, and a few times since. 

In bed they had made love, and afterwards murmured incomprehensible affection. He had been near to declaring something, though it wasn't clear in his mind what exactly. A good thing too, as it avoided embarrassment, and after all, she was returning home. 

'You all right?' he murmured, and pulled her onto his lap. 

'Is he a good master?' he asked. 

'A slave shouldn't reveal things about a master,' she hesitantly stated. 

He was fiddling with her chains, then absently stroked a nipple. 

'You're right of course. None of my business. You had better get dressed. I've laid out something, not much,' he joked. 

Neither of them laughed. 

Riana felt uncomfortable in clothes, as though they were unnecessary, and in the way. She wore a ballerina tutu, sticking out straight from her hips. Under it, on show, was an insubstantial thong. A spandex boob-tube hugged her breasts. She went bare foot, which was a relief from wearing high heels. The only other item she wore was the sirik chains, connected from the collar to her wrists and ankles. 

The slave number tattooed on her arm was visible, and so was the bulge of a ring piercing her lips. It is clear what she is, a slave slut. She guessed the image was meant to humiliate Adrian, her husband. Because he left her with Jimmy as a slave, she didn't mind one little bit getting back at him. She'd overcome her embarrassment over being a slave, and showing off her body. So, why not rub her husband's nose in what he had put her through. She giggled at that. Little did he know she had enjoyed a week of absolute freedom, to play a naughty game. No, it wasn't a naughty game, it was a wonderfully filthy, dirty, game. 

In the auto-car she snuggled up to her master. 

'Where are we going, master?' Riana asked. 

Even with a bad sense of direction, she knew they were heading away from her home. 

'We're meeting on neutral ground. A friends place. I don't think there will be anyone you know there,' Jimmy reassured her. 

'Whatever you say, master,' she smiled up at him. 

A servant took their bags to a room, and they freshened up. Wearing such a flimsy outfit in a stranger's house was a little daunting, but nothing she couldn't handle. She hoped her husband brought some decent clothes with him, for when she travelled home. It would be embarrassing being seen by the servants, while dressed as a slave. 

There was a knock at the door. It was then Riana felt awkward over being seen like that. She nevertheless answered the door, as instructed by her master. Knowing this was all coming to an end, she freely submitted to him. It was an attempt to delay the moment, having to return to a life of responsibility and decision making. 

A well dressed young woman stood at the door, and looked Riana up and down. The sneer immediately put her back up, against the girl. She couldn't blame the young woman, for they were dressed so far apart in the social order. The dress was obviously by Ricardo of Milan, a recognisable design, as she had three of the expensive outfits by him. A slight jealousy tinged her cheeks, as the girl looked good in it. 

'Yes, what do you want?' Riana reacted. 

'Where's your master,' Bella imperiously asked. 

'Here, what do you want?' Jimmy asserted. 

'I'm here to take this slave to Adrian. He wishes to examine it before finalising the purchase,' Bella politely said. 

Jimmy chuckled, from knowing this was all a farce. He knew the slave was his wife, though he hadn't admitted that. Seeing his wife in chains might loosen his bank account a little more. He looked at his slave, and wondered if he wanted to sell her. Of course he couldn't keep the man's wife a slave. It just wasn't right. It hadn't been right to screw her either, but he had. 

He sighed heavily and said, 'Take her,' and waved a dismissive hand. 

Riana hadn't realised it would all end so suddenly. She lingered at the door, wanting to say some last words to her master. What could she possibly say? It was an impossible situation, caught between two different worlds, which were so far apart socially and personally. 

Her collar was jerked, and she stumbled into the corridor. 

'Come along, slave, hurry up,' Bella criticised. 

Bella knocked on a door, and waited for permission to enter. While they waited, Riana heard voices and became aware of her state of undress. It was early in the evening, yet a group of boisterous young men were at the far end of the corridor. Fortunately the door opened before they reached her. Showing off a thong might be too tempting for them to resist. Obviously a slave, they would expect her to defer to them. Riana shuddered at the thought of having to show them respect. 

'What in hell are you dressed like that for?' Adrian hollered. 

'My master. . .' she began, unable to continue. 

The fantasy was broken in her husband's presence. She just stood there as trained to do over the past week. It was automatic, and what else was she to do or say? Being scantily clad wasn't doing anything for either of them. Remembering that distant morning, when dressed like a fantasy slave for him, almost made her laugh. 

'Is that how you've been running around in front of that boy!' he demanded. 

'No!' she replied. 

She wanted to say Jimmy was no boy, he was more of a man than him. Neither could it be said that she was naked all the time. 

'What have you got to say for yourself, wife?' he said. 

'What do you mean? It was all a mistake. Why didn't you fetch me home?' she morosely complained. 

'I tried, but couldn't make a fuss. I guessed you were playing along to protect your identity. I certainly don't want him finding out. Think how it would look, if my business contacts found out my wife is a slave!' he crossly spoke. 

'You? You? What about me? I've had to endure being a slave!' Riana exploded. 

'I figured you were all right, otherwise you would have come home,' he nonchalantly said. 

She glared at him, too angry to speak. 

'Why didn't you just walk away? It would have saved me a lot of trouble,' he said. 

'A registered slave can't leave without permission,' she retorted. 

He sat, and she stood, glaring at each other. 

'What were you doing all week, you can't cook, or clean house,' he sneered. 

'Nothing,' she defensively said. 

'You must have done something. Did you?' began to goad her, then stopped on seeing her face. 'You did! You bitch!' he shouted. 

Riana's face was a picture of guilt, quickly resolving back to anger. 

'I'll buy you from that boy, and keep you as my slave,' he quietly spoke. 

'You can't do that! I'm your wife!' she retorted. 

'Not since you became a slave! All relationships become null and void. You'll come back here and serve my slave, that will teach you to obey me. I'll free her of the contract, before you,' he cruelly spoke, pointing at his slave 

Riana hadn't noticed the girl was still in the room. So this was the slave he bought! A glance told her all that was necessary to know. One of her designer dresses had been altered to fit the girl, maybe more of them. The sly look on its face, revealed the it had wormed its way into her husband's affections. 

'You've been at it with THAT, while I was away! Don't deny it,' she crossly spoke. 

'While you were at it with him!' he returned. 

'Take this slave back to its master. Now I know how things are with her, I'll offer him nothing above what he paid me,' he told Bella. 

Bella took a firm hold of the leash, and dragged Riana from the room, while she was thinking of a retort. 

'On your knees, slave,' Bella commanded. 

Riana tried to retaliate, but the girl tripped her, and she fell to the floor. While trying to get up the girl pulled an ear, making her squeal with pain. She felt a sharp sting of the leather leash across her bare bottom. 

'Do as you're told, slave. You're no longer the haughty rich housewife you once were, so get used to serving me bitch,' Bell warned her. 

Riana pulled herself up off the floor onto hands and knees. This was a dreadful shock. Surely her husband didn't mean he would keep her as a slave. When he bought her from Jimmy, she would still be a slave until Adrian signed the government release form. How could she live in her own house as a slave? The thought of serving this girl as a personal slave was appalling! 

The girl tugged on the collar choking her, while dragging her along the corridor. A bunch of boisterous guys piled out of a bedroom right in front of them. 

'Nice slave, well trained,' one of them commented. 

'What's it trained for? Any good for sex?' another asked. 

'Of course it is, but not for you,' Bella sharply answered. 

'Come on, lend it to us, we won't wear it out,' the first one cajoled her. 

'I'll see, maybe later,' Bella smiled at them. 

Bella pushed through the bunch of young men. Riana felt hands groping her body, as she crawled among their legs. 

Riana followed her tormentor into a bedroom as fast as she could crawl. She recognised one of the guys as a friend's son. Maybe some of the others too were son's of friends. They had groped her bare bottom, and watched her crawling on a leash. If they recognised her they would be sure to tell their parents about her demise! She could hear them outside, discussing what they wanted to do with a well trained sex slave. 

'Now then, slave. Do you want me to send you out there, to those young men, or are you going to behave yourself?' Bella asked. 

'Please, take me back to my master,' Riana quietly pleaded. 

'All in good time. I don't care either way. When those randy guys bring you back, you'll be subdued then. I'm sure you'll co-operate after they've worked you over. So what is it to be, slave?' Riana grinned. 

'I, I'll, do, do, as you say,' Riana stammered. 

'Good slave girl. First thing, call me mistress,' she ordered. 

'Yes, mistress,' Riana said. 

Bella put a hand under Riana, pulled the top away and roughly felt her breasts, until satisfied. Pulling the panty crotch away, she felt her pussy and ass. 

'Nice tits, slave. You've got a cute little pussy, and a tight asshole. I look forward to using you as my personal slave,' Bella chuckled. 

'No protesting,' Bella said, and slapped her bare ass. 'I'll soon have you trained as an obedient slave girl. Inspection over, and the guys have gone, so back to your master.' 

'First though, you should show your mistress how grateful you are. I didn't give you to those guys, so, do a good job, otherwise I could change my mind,' Bella warned. 

Gripping the leash taught, she pulled the slaves face into her crotch. 

'Get licking, slave,' she ordered. 

Riana had never contemplated such as this in her life. She was used to the fumbling of her husband down there, and of course knew what she would want. With the aim of getting it over and done with, she tried her hardest. Feeling the girl open up, she licked the hard little clit, and pressed it with her teeth. Everything was opening up and getting wet. She licked, kissed, and pressed with tongue, lips, and teeth. She worked the girls slit hard, wanting her to hurry up and climax. 

The girl put a hand to the back of her head, pushing Riana's tongue into her vagina. She wriggled it around, and was pleased to hear the girl moaning. The girl's whole body relaxed and the hand fell away, so she could sit back on the floor. Unintentionally she assumed a slave pose, with hands upward, resting on her splayed knees. 

'That was Very nice, slave. You look so cute squatting on your haunches. Such an adorable slave pose, you look so lowly and docile like that. I can't wait to teach you my needs little pet-girl. You shall practice licking me every day,' Bella informed her. 

She took Riana's chin in one hand, lifting her head to look into watery eyes. 

With a serious tone, she said, 'I'll train you until you're absolutely submissive and deferential, then I'll let the servants have you. One each day will keep you busy and satisfied. Don't you think?' 

'Yes, mistress,' Riana reluctantly agreed. 

It was worse than she had thought. The girl had no finer feelings and had despicable ideas over how to treat her. The sooner she escaped the witch the better. With a mind sluggish from shock and despair, it was difficult to think of a way out of this trap. 

The nasty girl didn't have to drag her this time. She eagerly crawled as fast as she could, at the end of the leash, back to her master. The door opened and she scrambled in. The girl didn't say anything, and the door was quickly shut on that hellish half hour. 

Riana had licked and sucked her husband's slave girl! She felt thoroughly depraved, and lost the last shred of self-esteem. Her self-worth slipped through her fingers, with the memory of what she has done. 

At her masters feet she burst into tears. 

Jimmy got onto the floor next to her, stroking her hair, and wiping away the tears. She tried to tell him what was wrong, but the sobs cut her off. Eventually the tears dried up, and she blew her nose. 

'Thank you, master,' she managed to say. 

'So you had a fond welcome from Adrian,' he stated. 

Riana tried to smile, a wane imitation developed. 

'Tell me all about it,' he said. 

He propped a pillow under their heads, and nestled close. A gentle kiss was meant to encourage her. She finished telling him everything, except licking that damn girl. 

'May I stay with you, master? It's the only thing I can think of, to escape them both,' she said. 

'Do you just want to stay, to escape them?' he asked. 

'I, I want, I want to stay with you, master,' she sincerely pleaded. 

'Are you sure? You're used to all the finery that Adrian can provide,' he said. 

'I'd rather be naked and your slave, I really would. Will you be my master, and keep me as your slave? Please,' she begged. 

'There is nothing I would like more. Cheer up slave, your master demands it,' he ordered. 

'Oh! Thank you, master,' she gladly said, and hugged him. 

'We'll leave now. I won't negotiate with Adrian. I don't know what he can do about it. It would be too embarrassing for him, to make fuss over his wife being a slave,' he said. 

It took a moment or two for it to sink in. 

'You know! When did you find out?' she asked. 

'I'm sorry, Riana. It's all my fault, though I'm glad it happened. Maybe you aren't, of course. Mistaking you for a slave was meant as joke, then it got out of hand. I just wanted to get back at Adrian. He cheated my father out of a lot of credits, but that's not your fault,' he said, looking ashamed. 

'I'm glad too, master,' she smiled. 

They returned home, cuddling in the back seat of an auto-car. Returning to Jimmy's home, she found herself behaving subservient, and obedient. She just couldn't shake off the feeling of being nothing more than his owned object. 

He treated her like a precious slave, always considerate, and caring. His care for her lifted all worries from her shoulders. She no longer had to decide anything at all, from what to wear to what to eat, as she deferred to her master in all things. When near him, she was gloriously happy, and when not, she only had to think of him for a wave of happiness to overcome her. 

In bed after making love, he turned to her and pushed her away, to study her features. 

'I want to set you free, and marry you. I love you so much,' he carefully stated. 

He watched the emotions in her face, hoping for the right answer. 

'Not yet, let's wait awhile, see what happens,' she said, and kissed him. 

'Alright,' he said, but was determined to make her his wife. 

They shared loving caresses, and cuddled warmly. She wondered what might happen in the future. A handsome young man with prospects, wasn't someone to be kept waiting. He was much younger, which might prove a problem sooner or later. She didn't want to make another mistake. She was happy being his slave girl, and didn't want to take a chance of spoiling it.  

===

On reflection he shouldn't have been so brusque with his wife, Riana, as they parted on bad terms. Of course he was angry with his wife, and said things he shouldn't have. She'd been acting like a fool, pretending to be a slave at that boy's house. Didn't she realise what a fool he would look, if anyone found out she'd been mistaken for a slave? For the sake of what friends would say, he needed to get her back without revealing she was his wife. 

On the way home he prepared an apology, only to find she wasn't there. 

'My wife has run off with that damn boy, or he's run off with my wife, I'm not sure which,' Adrian moaned. 

'Riana is no longer your wife, master,' Bella pointed out. 

'What do you mean?' he asked his slave. 

'When registered as a slave all previous relationships are void, master,' Bella explained. 

'She could have at least explained what she was playing at, while we were at that friend's house. It was supposed to be neutral ground, so Jimmy and I could negotiate a settlement. Yet they scuttled off before I had a chance to make an offer,' he huffed. 

Bella thought he hadn't given his wife a chance to explain anything, though as a slave, she wasn't in a position to comment. 

'As a slave, she should have respected you, master,' Bella suggested. 

'If she had returned home, I would have taken her back. If she wants to be with that nineteen year old boy, that's her decision. It's disgusting!' he grimaced. 

'Yes, master. She wasn't a dutiful wife, or an obedient slave,' Bella agreed. 

It didn't suit her to inform him a slave couldn't travel at will. Riana couldn't just come home, as a destination had to be registered on the government computer system. It was a measure strictly enforced to prevent runaway slaves. The police would pick her up if she left the master's home without authorisation. 

'She can damn well stay with him for all I care. It will be so very embarrassing meeting friends if it becomes known my wife is now that boy's slave. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't bother taking her back,' he said, with evident aggravation in his voice. 

'When she returns, no-one need know she was mistaken for a slave,' Bella said, trying to sooth her master's anger. 

'If she returns, and if I accept her back,' he scathingly stated. 

'When Tommy sells her to you, she will be your slave, and won't have a choice, master,' Bella said. 

'You said she's no longer my wife, so what's the point of taking her back?' he said. 

'As a slave, she can be taught to obey you, and pose as your dutiful wife, master. No one need know of her foolish mistake. This will avoid unpleasantness in polite society, master. I could train her to be an obedient wife, master,' she suggested. 

'Of course, when I buy her back she'll be my slave, not my wife. When she was, I couldn't do anything with her, so I'll hand her over to you then. See if you can make her do as she's told, and behave like a decent wife,' he angrily spoke. 

'Thank you, master. I shall train her to be submissive, and ready to obey, so she doesn't get into any more trouble,' Bella stated. 

'If you think you can achieve that, then I'll give you a free hand with her training. I don't want to get involved, you'll just have to get on with whatever it takes to fully train her,' Adrian said, dismissively. 

Although Bella was Adrian's slave, she was looking forward to the wife returning home. Household servants said Riana was a tyrant when running the house, so training her to be an obedient slave would be all the more satisfying. The woman had been partially trained by Tommy, leaving her susceptible. Bella intended taking full advantage, by using punishments and rewards in a thorough training program. 

With the husband out of the way, she would soon hone the wife into an obedient slave. She imagined giving the selfish woman to the household servants, for them to take revenge. The once self-important woman, reduced to sucking up to servants, was a fascinating image. The dominant wife, demanding they dance to her tune, would become submissive their whims. 

Giving her to the male household servants for the night, would push her over the edge. The remnants of self-worth would be crushed, leaving the woman a worthless slut. The butler had some very strange desires, and she wondered how the stuck up bitch would cope with him. 

Bella laughed a deep throaty sound of satisfaction. Adrian had given his wife to her as a gift. Already she had lots of ideas on how to train the woman into becoming her toy, and couldn't wait to play with her. 

She had been working on Adrian to free her of the slave contract, and was close to success. What he didn't realise was that he could only free one slave a year, so his wife would have to remain a slave when she returned home. Living in luxury as a free woman, with Adrian under her thumb, and his wife as her personal pet slave, would be idyllic. 

*** 

Riana knew she should return home, and would have to eventually. Though, it was difficult to escape such a tranquil life. No decisions to make, no arguments, no responsibilities, no bitchy socialites to contend with. Ironically, as a slave she felt free, more than she had ever done before. 

'Let Adrian suffer a little more,' she said. 

'You don't have to return to him. He's got that slave to warm his bed, so he doesn't need you. I do. I need you and want you,' Jimmy told her. 

'He's my husband, and we both have to take social etiquette seriously,' she reminded him. 

'You're my slave now. I might not sell you back to him,' he retorted. 

'Technically I'm your slave. Well, legally too, I guess. But, it was all a mistake, you know that,' she reminded him. 

'Your marriage was only arranged to bind two wealthy families together. It's a sham. He only wants you back to save the embarrassment. He hasn't even shown the decency of coming round here to demand you back,' Jimmy hotly stated. 

'We were happy once. I guess we just drifted apart like a lot of couples. Different interests, leading to different lives. This won't work Jimmy, I'm too old for you, err, master,' she said. 

'I legally own you, you just admitted it. You can't leave here without me registering your destination, and I won't let you go,' he defiantly stated. 

'We have to behave decently, setting an example, or society will fall apart. It's already teetering on the edge of chaos. All those people unemployed, and ruined by the financial crisis. Too many lives are in turmoil,' she lectured. 

'All this started through a silly mistake. I was too obstinate and embarrassed to admit to being Adrian's wife. So it was my fault for being scared, and just going along with it all. You know you have to do the right thing, and put the mistake right,' Riana told him. 

'I know, and I'll do that, maybe. Alright! If you really think you must return to him. I too am trying to do the right thing for society. You're not the only one with high moral standards,' he said. 

She forgot for a moment that she was sleeping with a man much younger, and cuckolding her husband. He was ignoring that he'd kidnapped her, and enslaved her. 

'I'm trying to do something to mend society. I'm doing my bit to help. That's why it's so important for me to get a loan. I'm buying up unwanted inner-city land and buildings. We are using unemployed craftsmen to teach skills to others, to re-develop abandoned inner-city areas. The new developments will be sold to those who built them, and they will go on to work on another section. It will grow into a national rebuilding program. I just need to get it off the ground. Once started it will be self-financing,' he lectured. 

'I didn't know. That sounds such a worthwhile project. I'm proud of you Jimmy,' she smiled, and spontaneously kissed him. 

They soon became entwined, enwrapped in their own little world. Riana had become used to being naked, and thought it natural for a master to fondle her breasts. She couldn't help becoming worked up, especially now he knew her body so well. They rolled around on the large bed, kissing and caressing each other's body. 

For a moment she thought to stop this madness, as she had to prepare for the time she returned to her husband. This was disloyal, despite him ignoring her for such a long time, then taking a slave girl to his bed. Well, just this once then. After all, Adrian was her master, and was entitled to use her. 

He was licking her pussy in such a delightful way, she just lay still experiencing every wonderful sensation. After awhile she threw her head back, emitting a guttural moan from deep inside. She pushed him away, and clambered on top of him. 

Impatiently, she lowered herself onto his rock hard cock, heavily pressing down. A sigh of relief was short lived, as she began to pound upon his hips, building yet again toward an orgasm. Her breasts were jiggling tantalisingly close, so he grabbed them and held on. 

An orgasm stilled them both. Heavy sighs escaped wide open mouths. They were dry from exertion. She collapsed upon his chest feeling his penis shrink from her vagina. She turned her head to look at him, and saw the look of love. 

'I love you, master,' she said, making it sound like a promise. 

'I love you, slave,' he returned, and sighed contentedly. 

*** 

Another three pleasurable days passed, with Riana acting out her fantasy of being a slave. It was easy to accomplish for she was legally a slave, with a masterful man as her owner. He knew how to treat her during the day, and during the night. She dutifully served him, pushing to the back of her mind that she had another life waiting for her. Life would return to the boring routine on returning home, but it was the right thing to do. 

She was happily re-arranging and dusting the books in his study. 

'That slave, Bella. How much influence does she have in your home?' Jimmy asked. 

The question was so unexpected, she had to think what he meant. 

'I don't know, master,' she honestly answered. 

Thinking back to that meeting with her husband, she remembered him taking notice of the girl. Adrian spitefully told her she would return home to be Bella's personal slave. Of course it was just a typical angry outburst and would soon forget it. Bella had heard this, and gleefully rubbed it in that she would be trained as a personal slave. She'd already been softened up by Jimmy, into being a compliant slave, and the girl took advantage. 

Riana grimaced over recalling that she had sucked the pussy of her husband's slave girl. The audacity of the girl was outrageous. As soon as she returned home she would have to put the girl in her place, or sell her on. Her husband would back her up with his authority, reinforcing the power she had in her own house. 

'Carry on, slave,' Jimmy commanded. 

If Adrian didn't buy Riana back, he would have to set her free, even though he hated the idea of letting her go. There was an age difference to be considered, but he didn't care. Would he in a few years time? Freeing Riana would let her make the decision for herself, whether to stay or not. 

Riana dismissed the unpleasant thoughts about Bella, to carry on as an obedient slave. It was one of the advantages of being a slave, leaving everything to her master. She didn't have to worry about her husband making contact for her return home. That was something for her master to deal with. 

Jimmy didn't tell her there was a government notice posted, stating Adrian intended an early release of his slave, Bella. He wondered if Riana realised her marriage was null and void, even if her husband bought her back. He hadn't realised it at the time, otherwise he wouldn't have made it official. Registering her as a slave had been done to get back at her husband. He now regretted it, sort of. 

*** 

A couple of weeks went by with Jimmy busy over business arrangements. It seemed it was harder than he thought to organise people, even when it was to their advantage to co-operate. It reminded Riana how much younger and inexperienced he was. As a rich man's son, he was an innocent in a tough world. 

The nights were still exciting and adventurous. The sex was enough to keep her enjoying his company. He discarded business worries once home, to concentrate on her, leaving her feeling like the most important person in the world. She was happy with him, and therefore happy to be there as his slave. 

While he was out, she would think about returning home. Feeling so relaxed and satisfied with Jimmy, made it an unappetising prospect. Facing her husband, and that slave girl wasn't something to be looking forward to. She'd become so submissive and obedient, she was afraid of being dominated by that horrid slave girl. Would she regain the wherewithal to stand up for herself, after so long being subservient? 

Jimmy marched in, breaking into her thoughts with a cheerful chuckle. 

'We're having a party. To celebrate the first homes to be restored. Enough people have been taught trades to carry on with the next phase,' he happily announced. 

'I'm so pleased for you, master,' Riana glowed with happiness for him. 

They hugged and kissed in the kitchen, making the usual pleasant sounds of congratulation and acceptance. 

'I've called in some help to set things up for the party. I've invited some of the investors, though not Adrian. In any case, his investment hasn't been forthcoming so far. I can understand why,' he chuckled. 

'Perhaps I should return home, so he releases the funds,' she offered. 

'Nonsense, this is your home now! You're my slave, and had better do as you're told, or else,' he said, trying to sound fierce. 

The happiness broke through again, as he tunelessly whistled his way back to the office. 

Riana was so much older than him, she couldn't believe this would last. He hadn't thought it through. It worried her that he would abandon her when the gap in their ages showed on her body. At the moment she was fit enough to keep up with him. She was beautiful, and had a sexy body, as he often reminded her. It would be better to preserve the memory of these wonderful heady weeks, by returning home before reality set in. 

Concentrating on the party pushed aside all negative thoughts. A woman from a catering agency cooked and prepared the food, while Riana decorated the dining table. She would serve the guests while the woman took care of everything in the kitchen. 

'Everything going to plan?' Jimmy asked. 

'Everything's good,' the woman answered. 

'One thing. Can you dress up my slave? I don't want anyone to recognise her. Not a ridiculous disguise, just put them off the track,' he suggested. 

'Certainly. I do makeovers, will that do?' Beatrice asked. 

'Sounds good. I'll leave it to you,' he said. 

'Slave! Make sure you follow Beatrice's orders. Don't worry, I'm sure no one will be there you know,' he said, and marched back to the office. 

The woman looked at her and shrugged. 

'We had better find some time to look through your wardrobe,' she said. 

They carried on with the work in hand, until little could be done before guests arrived. They went to Riana's room which had hardly been used, and it showed. In a walk-in wardrobe were various party outfits. All of them sexy. In another bedroom were men's outfits, not so sexy. Jimmy must have had some interesting parties in the past. 

Several outfits that fitted were held up against her body, and rejected. As ordered, Riana left it up to Beatrice to dress her, and apply makeup. 

After the makeup had been applied, Beatrice found a pink girly outfit in the back of the wardrobe. There wasn't that much to it, though after several weeks being naked, it was better than wearing nothing at all in front of guests. 

Almost everything was pink, which matched her glistening lips. She wore a half cup bra, thong, apron, and five inch stilettos, which were shiny black. Fluffy wrist and ankle cuffs, a maids cap, also in pink, were added. 

Beatrice had difficulty locking the high heels on Riana's feet, from laughing so much. That seemed the end of it, until the woman found more accessories. Riana tried to protest, but the woman pointed out how different she now looked, and that no one would be looking at her face. 

As an obedient slave she had become used to doing as she was told, so desisted from making a fuss. When her master saw the ridiculous outfit, it would be rejected, and she could wear the French maid's uniform. Wearing long pink fingernails would make it impossible to undo the little padlocks on the shoes. Though, that wasn't all she would have to contend with. 

Beatrice buckled a pink leather collar around Riana's neck, covering the slave collar. She ran a chain from it to the wrist cuffs, so Riana couldn't lower her hands below the waist. It was awkward holding up her hands like a Praying Mantis, but she could still carry a tray to serve the guests 

Riana again protested when Beatrice attached silver bells to her nipples. 

'Stop that complaining, slave. You're master told you to obey me. He wants you unrecognizable by the guests, and who would believe you were the demure, well spoken woman of earlier,' she firmly spoke. 

After primping Riana's long blond hair into place, the woman declared, 'No one will recognise you now!' 

It had to be acknowledged, she looked different, entirely different from before. There hadn't been much choice of clothing in her size, but the damn woman had become carried away with the girly theme. To Beatrice it was a joke. It was a good disguise, though it would be terribly humiliating being seen by someone she knew. 

A short chain connected the shoes together, leaving her no option but take small steps. She practiced before the guests arrived, finally getting the hang of spiked heels and enforced tiny steps. With every movement her breasts jiggled over the top of the bra. When her breasts swayed or bounced, the little bells rang out. The tinkling was annoying at first, but she soon blocked it out. 

*** 

The guests arrived leaving Riana feeling nervous. The last time she entertained guests was in her home, where she was the hostess. Now she was a mere slave having to serve. She took a deep breath and walked into the dining room. 

Jimmy's father gave him the old family home, after moving into a large modern house. The long antique dining table could seat twelve, only this evening there were six guests spread around it. Candelabra's on the table, and soft lighting around the room, complimented the old fashioned decor. The dim lighting also made it more difficult to recognise Riana. 

The three investors and their girlfriends were all around Jimmy's age. No one in her social circle was here, so maybe it was a waste of effort. Was exhibiting her body before these young people less embarrassing, or more so. The woman applying the makeup got carried away, then picked the completely wrong outfit. Instead of being an unobtrusive waitress, able to blend into the background, the image portrayed an outrageous bimbo look. 

One by one the guests became silent, as each of them noticed her emerge from the kitchen. Jimmy was surprised, though he quickly recovered. He couldn't keep a chuckle from his throat when asking what the guests wanted to drink. 

'Fetch the drinks, slave,' he said, trying not to laugh. 

Riana's hair had been dyed platinum blond, and tied into pigtails. The makeup was heavily plastered on, almost becoming a mask. She wore bright blue eye shadow, black eyeliner, false eyelashes, rouge, and a vibrant pink lipstick. Her natural pouting, sulky lips, were highlighted to attract the attention of men. 

The sophisticated society woman had been transformed into a Barbie doll. Riana certainly wouldn't be recognised now. 

Riana had survived in the dining room without the expected disparaging remarks. In the kitchen she helped Beatrice as best she could, to prepare cocktails and more straight forward drinks for the men. She reminded herself of what each of them ordered, and sorted the glasses on a tray accordingly.  

===

'One more thing. Open wide,' Beatrice commanded. 

Distracted by nerves she opened her mouth, not thinking why. She choked, and coughed, trying to clear her throat. 

'A finishing touch to your outfit,' Beatrice laughed, creasing over with a near convulsion. 

'What do you mean?' Riana squeaked. 'What the hell?' 

'A voice changer. It's not permanent, it will dissolve overnight,' the woman explained. She slapped Riana's bare bottom, to speed her on her way. 'Get to it, slave!' 

Riana trotted out of the kitchen on spiked high heels, lifting them so as not to get caught in the deep pile carpet. The small steps wobbled her breasts, which the men watched with interest. The tinkling bells sounded loud, building the embarrassment toward humiliation. 

She dare not look at her master, wondering if he had set her up, or was this wholly Beatrice's idea. On serving him the last drink on the tray, she could see he approved. So, either way, she was stuck being a blonde bimbo for the evening. 

'What's on the menu, slave?' he asked. 

Riana was dreading this. She tried to clear her throat, hoping not to sound like a quacking duck. To no avail, she had to recite this evenings' starters and main meals. The guests were relaxing over a drink, enough for their reticence to fade, and began to laugh. Jimmy didn't scold them, or even look as though he might. 

The way she was dressed left her vulnerable, and the way she sounded left her feeling feeble. The thing in her throat changed her voice to a high pitched squeak. She looked the part, sounded like one, so she must be a stupid bimbo, and would be treated like one. The men looked at her with sex clearly on their minds. They were thinking she was a dumb bimbo, ready to jump into bed with anyone spouting a clever line. The women looked at her with disdain plainly written upon their faces. 

'Can she go through the list again?' someone asked. 

Feeling highly embarrassed Riana quoted the choices once more, in the embarrassing high pitched, girly, sing song voice. There were two choices of starter and a vegetarian option for the main meal. Though of course the non- vegetarian dish was a grown product of some sort, as real meat hadn't been available for the last fifty years. 

The guests laughed again as she spoke the options, though less so. Beatrice had been right, it was easy hiding in front of everyone. No one looked at her, or at least not at her face, as the costume was a grand distraction. Or rather, the naked parts of her body attracted attention. Men ogled her, and women scowled at her. 

The guests were too busy catching up on gossip, to take much notice of the slave serving dinner. The slave ran back and forth, with food and drink, trying her best to keep them happy. There was no time to think over her new position, as a leading socialite, reduced to serving a boisterous group of adolescents. They were in the same college as her master, and had plenty to talk about, so almost ignored her. 

Standing back for a moment while they sipped wine, she had a chance to think. She was no longer bothered over maintaining a social position, for she had none. A lowly slave was a mere object, just something there to be used. It was a refreshing thought, not having to constantly play a role, not having to pretend to like obnoxious people. 

Riana helped herself to some food, and a glass of wine didn't go amiss either. 

'Have you seen Riana, you know, Adrian's wife?' Andrew asked Jimmy. 

Riana's thoughts were suddenly brought back to the guests conversation. 

'Can't say I have, why do you ask?' Pippa jutted in. 

'My parents were talking about her. Haven't seen her for a few weeks,' Andrew said. 

'She's resigned from most of the committee's, mother mentioned,' Irene added. 

'He's got a new slave girl, and keeps her very close, I hear,' Brendon grinned. 

'You don't think he's done something to her, do you?' Pippa asked. 

'You can't do something to someone of such high status without servants gossiping. The whispers would soon get back to us,' Andrew stated. 

'What did you think might have happened to her?' Jimmy teased. 

'Murdered, and buried in the woods,' Pippa mischievously proposed. 

'There's a lot of people who would consider that. She's an unpleasant harridan, from what I hear,' Andrew said. 

'My mother was relieved not to encounter her at charity functions,' Paula added. 

'So, a stuck up bitch has gone missing for a few weeks. Sounds if it suits everyone,' Brendon chuckled, and the others laughed along. 

Riana was crestfallen. Had she been such a bad person, acting like a harridan and a bully, as they suggested? Sometimes people needed pushing into making a decision, and she hadn't held back from what was necessary. Poor victims could be without a roof over their heads, while these wealthy people sat on their bottoms, prevaricating over what was obviously the right thing to do. 

They were either stupid or uncaring, not fit to sit on the charity committees. Paula's mother was one of those fitting both cases. Like her mother the girl didn't want to know about others needs. Those sort of people just attended the committee's to be seen rather than achieve something. 

Riana topped up a glass, and let a touch of anger rattle her. The red wine dribbled over the long sleeve of Paula's dress. 

'Stupid girl, look what you've done!' Paula blurted out. 

The young woman was sixteen years younger than her, and only just climbing the social ladder. Even relying on her parents position, she should have deferred to an older woman, and especially to someone of Riana's status. Not now though, as all the girl saw was a slave girl available for abuse. 

'Very sorry, miss, let me wipe it, miss,' Riana humbly reacted. 

Over the last few weeks she had learnt to accept a punishment following a mistake. That it might be administered before these young guests, had her cringing from embarrassment. 

'Stop that! You're ruining the damn thing! Stupid girl! This dress costs more than you're worth,' Paula trilled unpleasantly. 

'Sorry, miss,' Riana said, and tried to sidle away. 

'Come here! Don't you keep control of your servants and slaves, Jimmy?' she demanded. 

'Of course, she'll be reprimanded, later,' Jimmy shrugged. 

'Not good enough. A short sharp shock works better. Makes them more careful, and attentive,' Paula crossly spoke. 

Grabbing a wrist, the girl pulled Riana over her knee. The thong hid nothing of her bottom, so a smack to a bare cheek was easily administered. 

'Well? Don't you count, and thank me for punishing you?' Paula demanded. 

'Sorry, miss. One, miss. Thank you for punishing me, miss,' Riana meekly said. 

'Oww! Two, miss. Thank you for punishing me, miss,' she repeated. 

Unlike Jimmy, this girl was determined to punish her, and slapped her bottom hard. After ten strokes on her upturned bare bottom, she couldn't hold back tears. 

Standing before the callous adolescents trying not to rub her sore bottom, with tears falling, she felt small and worthless. The girl could afford to give the dress to charity without a thought, however expensive it was. There had been no need to humiliate her in front of everyone. 

'Sorry, miss, for spilling wine on your dress. Thank you for punishing me. This slave promises to be a good slave girl, miss,' Riana squeaked. 

She no longer noticed the pathetic sound of her voice. It was telling that she meant every word. Weeks of playing at being a slave in the secluded world of this house, had profoundly affected her. She thought of herself as a slave, dependent upon a master's good will. Besides, she was legally a slave until her husband bought her back, and freed her. 

Again she automatically tried to pull the panty crotch back in place, and again the chains prevented her reaching them. 

Paula smiled at her victim, and said, 'Come here, slave.' 

The others, including Jimmy, were quietly watching the scene. The guys wished they had the slave on their knees. Not for a spanking though. The shapely ass was tempting, but the panty crotch had come adrift, revealing the slave's charms. 

The girls had already been scathing over what she was like, judging from how she was dressed. Walking around undressed in front of their boyfriends was all wrong, even for a slave. They considered the bimbo slave deserved a good spanking to keep it in place. 

Paula put a hand on Riana's head, making her kneel. So used to her master doing the same, she took up a slave position. She squatted at the girls feet, with hands palm upward, resting on her spread knees. 

Paula tucked a finger under Riana's chin, lifting her head. She looked at her, with steel blue eyes. The eyes revealed the girl was a bad combination, of being dim and severe. 

'There, there, slave girl. No need to cry. You deserved a punishment, and now it's over. Promise to be a good girl, and you can get on with your duties,' Paula said. 

The tone of voice was demeaning, as though she were talking to a pet. She was talking to what appeared to be a dumb blond bimbo, so of course she spoke slowly and simply. 

'Thank you, miss. This slave promises to be a good girl, and to behave itself, miss,' Riana stated. 

She rose to her feet feeling revived. Anger should have been felt, from having to submit to a young girl of nineteen. Promising to be a good girl in front of these teens, left her feeling humble and eager to serve. 

'It's well marked. Slave tattoo and piercings,' one of the girls remarked. 

'You're lucky to have such an obedient slave, Jimmy,' Brendon openly grinned. 

The others laughed, knowing what he meant. The guys wondered what it would be like to have an obedient woman in their bed. A moment or two of quiet contemplation ringed the table. 

'A stupid bimbo with a lush body was a good purchase,' Andrew agreed. 

'Where did you get it?' Susan asked. 

'A government auction,' Jimmy lied. 

'I guess it would be cheaper there, especially at that age,' Pippa said. 

'Was it a runaway?' Susan enquired. 

'The government auctions are for runaways, but also for bankruptcy cases,' Jimmy said. 

'So the slave is sold like any other item for sale, like an object,' Pippa gleefully pointed out. 

'That sounds cruel,' Irene interrupted. 

Brendon was hoping for the conversation to continue without him, as he had a hand between the slaves thighs, and didn't want to be noticed. 

Riana looked at him, trying to gain his attention. She couldn't let him get away with anything, and neither did she want to attract attention. It was important not to get into trouble with her master. Damn! The young man was fiddling with her bits. 

Oh! Shit! She hadn't looked at any of them properly until now. She recognised the young man. He was a friend's son! 

Fucking hell! A friend's son was finger fucking her, and there wasn't a thing she could do about it. If these heartless youths found out, she would be severely punished. His girlfriend, Susan, would probably demand it be carried out before everyone. They wouldn't care that she was a slave, and was trained to be subservient, so had to obey. To them she was a woman behaving immorally. 

Worse than that was how her master would react. He would privately punish her far more severely, bodily, and mentally. He might be angry enough to sell her on to someone. How would her husband ever find her, if Jimmy didn't tell him where she'd been sold? She might not ever be free again! Doomed to spend the rest of her life as a slave. 

The fear, and salubrious situation, heated her up. Her pussy was opening to his inexpert fingers. Standing next to a young guy of nineteen, letting him finger fuck her was humiliating, and that too stoked her up. If she wasn't careful it would show on her face. She tried to pull away, but he had a firm grip of her pussy. She was hooked by invasive fingers. 

A finger pushed up into her bottom, and she could feel the two of them working her body. At any other time she might have let go and cum. Not now, not in front of a group of teens. Please don't let that happen! She silently whimpered. 

Susan kicked her boyfriend under the table. He looked at her, focused, then pulled his hands away from the slave. Brendon shrugged, and gave her a dopey smile. It wasn't enough to placate her. 

'Come here, slave,' Susan said, crooking a finger. 

On high heels Riana took little steps around the table, provocatively wiggling her bottom. From the first step she felt the panties were awry and automatically reached to adjust them. The chains to wrist cuffs stopped the action. In a quandary she continued what seemed like a thousand steps, knowing how it would look when standing before the girl. 

Only a few weeks ago she had been a mature and responsible woman. Letting a boy finger fuck her at this dinner party, before everyone, was despicable. The evidence was there for his girlfriend to see, as the soaking wet panties had been shoved to one side. Her pussy was open, on show, and would be noticed. The dire prospect of being held up to ridicule yet again was looming closer and closer. 

There was nothing for it, but do as she was told, and leave responsibility for her actions to others. 

'Have you always been a slut?' the girl sweetly asked. 

Taken by surprise, without thinking she automatically responded, 'Yes, miss.' 

'Of course you are. Only a slut would dress like that. Only a dirty slut would let a man finger her, in front of his girlfriend,' she quietly spoke. 

One by one the others around the table quietened, to intently listen in on the cat fight. It was one sided, considering Riana was a slave, and had to comply with whatever her betters stipulated. 

'I see, you can't defend your sex, or adjust your panties. You'll have to leave them like that, as evidence of your dirtiness. You are a dirty little tramp, aren't you,' Susan ground in. 

'Yes, miss,' Riana said, and cringed as though struck. The young woman was looking at her, waiting for more. 'This slave is a dirty little tramp, miss,' she added. 

'At least we know what you are, and can treat you accordingly,' Susan dismissively spoke. 'Fetch me some wine, and don't you dare spill a drop, dirty little slave girl,' she added. 

Riana dare not look at her master. She had let him down, and just hoped he would forgive her. There was no doubt she had to be on her best behaviour, or be severely punished for the slightest misdemeanour. 

'Maybe you shouldn't have bought a dumb blond bimbo, Jimmy,' Pippa commented. 

'Maybe you're right,' he sighed. 

'You could send her back to the auction, and get another,' Pippa suggested. 

The obnoxious young woman was pushing him to see how attached he was to the slave. No clue had been revealed so far, so she decided to push as far as was possible. 

Jimmy watched his slave change from putting up with the situation, to accepting it. She submissively served his guests, ready to concede to their instructions without question. Partly from needing to avoid a humiliating punishment, and also from having been thoroughly demoralised. 

Like everyone else, he had more than enough to drink. Unlike him, the girlfriends noticed how willing she was to please their boyfriends. She was a mere slave, so gave way to letting them intimately touch her. Each of the young guys wondered if they would get away with bedding her this night. 

Jimmy at last recognised he needed to do something. His helpless slave needed his guidance and protection. Wearing chains she couldn't cover her sex, or defend it. Jealousy kicked him hard, from watching them play with her body. It was no longer discreet, when they openly fumbled with her sex, and breasts. Her body was exposed and no one bothered to pull her panties back in place. 

'Ok, that's enough,' Jimmy said. 

The partners were needed to make the project succeed. A slave could be replaced. Except this slave was his lover, and he'd fallen for her. He pulled her panties back in place, and covered her as best as he could. The cloth pursing her sex was wet, showing how much she enjoyed their mauling of her body. The young guys had rung her bells. While they fiddled with her naughty bits, her breasts had swung the little bells hanging from them. 

'No more playing with the slave, OK?' he demanded. 

The girls smiled evilly. Unable to scratch the slaves eyes out, they would have to concentrate on revenge at home, with their boyfriends. 

The party was mostly cleared away with some cleaning-up left for the morning. Beatrice was paid off and left. Riana now had to face her master. 

'Sorry, master. Your slave let you down,' she quietly spoke. 

'You did, but I let you down too. Let's not think about it now. Leave it until morning. Time for bed, I'm tired,' Jimmy told her. 

Riana snuggle down the bed to place her head between his legs. She sucked his cock into her mouth, but he was soon asleep. She'd not excited her master, so again she had let him down. Maybe he was becoming tired of her! Worried over what he would do and say in the morning, it took awhile to drift off. 

It was a worry how precarious her position was. It had been recognised before, only she hadn't take it seriously. After that lewd exhibition at dinner, she was forced to face facts. She really was a slave, and if she displeased her master he had the right to sell her. It didn't look as though her husband was ready to buy her yet, so maybe a stranger would buy her. 

Once on the market, she would be sold on whenever a master became bored with her. She would spend the rest of her life as a slave, pandering to strangers whims. As she grew older her value would fall, putting her in the clutches of less wealthy men. She would end up serving the urges of perverts, or working in a brothel. 

Next morning she slid out of bed, careful not to wake her master. Unable to leave his estate she was stuck here, forced to face her fate. On hearing him shower, she cooked breakfast. Her hands shook, from wondering what was in store for her. 

'Nice breakfast, slave. If you have nothing to do around the house today, I'll show you my project,' Jimmy said. 

'Oh! Thank you master. Your slave would love to see it,' she simpered. 

Jimmy wondered why she was acting so strange this morning. She thanked him profusely for the clothes, which weren't much. She hung on his every word, and laughed a little too loudly at his pathetic jokes. In the vehicle she clung to him as though afraid to be outside the house. 

'You alright, slave?' he eventually asked. 

'Yes, master, thank you, master,' she obsequiously responded. 

'We're nearly there. The first row of city housing has been completed. It's value has more than doubled. We can re-mortgage the property to pay for the next phase,' he proudly announced. 

'That's wonderful, master. You're so clever, master,' she sincerely spoke. 

As his hangover cleared he realised why she was acting so strangely. She was afraid he was storing up a punishment for her, concerning last nights' bad behaviour. It wasn't her fault, but why tell her that now. Later would do. He smiled, and received an adoring look in return. 

She was acting like she thought a slave should. A real slave would probably be sullen and object to be forced into such a demeaning role. Though he hadn't the experience to know for sure. It was much better having her cling to him, rather than being nagged over being sold back to her husband. 

Riana desperately needed to make up for last night, and keep him from selling her. She just couldn't get it out of her head that he would become bored with her, as an older woman, and sell her. At least this master was nice and looked after her. 

To avoid being sold, she set her mind to being a perfect and obedient slave girl. She would avoid upsetting him by going on about her husband buying her back. After all, Adrian was no longer her husband, and she was officially Jimmy's slave.  

===

She smiled at him with a look of adoration. Her master was wonderful and more than a slave could hope for. A young man was making her happy, so why spoil this wonderful adventure? Riana put aside her previous life of problems, to put all her effort into keeping hold of this new life as a slave. Report_Story
