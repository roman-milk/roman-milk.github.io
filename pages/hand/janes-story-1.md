JANE'S STORY 

Jane Brooke Smithers was, for all intensive purposes, a happily married woman. She was born and raised in Seattle and now taught school there, as a grade 3 teacher. At 5'7" with a very athletic body, she was considered gorgeous and the sexiest teacher in the school. Jane had brown eyes and light brown hair that got lighter during the summer. She had a small nose, perky ears that stood out a little and slightly pouty lips, which drove men crazy because they made her appear wanton and very sensual. 

Even the young students realized Jane was well built, with luscious boobs and nipples that seemed to get hard for no reason at all. In fact, some of the boys used the protruding buds as their topic of adolescent kidding on many occasions. 

Jane had been married for 10 years. There were three good ones, five so-so ones and two lousy ones. She never considered having an affair, but that didn't stop her from participating in the normal workplace, sexual banter. Being a very attractive woman with a sexy body that made men stare was something she endured all of her life. Whenever she caught a man ogling her, she would blush or try to evade any intimate personal contact. 

Women were jealous of Jane's sexy body and that was probably the reason that none of them befriended her at work. The men on the other hand all wanted to be her friend, even on an intimate basis if possible. Jane was fairly close to a couple of the male teachers and one in particular who was going through a nasty marriage breakup. On numerous occasions she found herself listening and trying to be supportive for him, as it seemed the man was suffering a lot of mental stress. 

Life in the small school was anything but eventful, as everything seemed routine at first glance. There were four university students spending a semester at the school on an apprentice basis. They were studying to become teachers and the training at a real grade school was extremely beneficial to their education. Two of the students were girls and two were boys. The usual practice had them spending one full semester of their final year on a practicum, actually assisting or teaching classes. All four spent time in Jane's classes from time to time, but it was the two boys who seemed to affect her in a manner that was a little extraordinary. 

Brad and Josh were best friends and lucky to spend their apprenticeship at the same school. They lived together so things were a lot easier, as they could travel to and from work using one vehicle. Jane liked both young men because they had very positive attitudes and seemed to love the idea of becoming teachers. Both were friendly and often teased and joked around with her, which was a refreshing change from the school's daily routine. 

Jane had no suspicion that she was the prize for a serious bet. Brad and Josh were both smitten by Jane's allure and shear innocence and they made a wager quite by chance. Josh jokingly suggested that the first one to date the sexy teacher would win an all-expense paid night out on the town. Brad's response was immediate and he raised the stakes considerably. He countered his buddy's bet with an even bigger wager. The first one to get into Jane's pants would not only win the sexy woman, but also the loser had to be a manservant around the apartment for an entire week. 

Josh clarified the wager by insisting that the winner had to actually have sex with Jane. Like most young men, they shook hands on it and each vowed to use every means possible to seduce the sexy teacher, which included deceit, trickery or any devious measures. The contest was made early in the school semester so it was before either young man got to know Jane very well. As the school term progressed, both Josh and Brad tried to put the moves on the adorable teacher whenever possible. The three spent almost every lunch period together and Jane soon got to know both young men on a fairly intimate basis. 

Brad and Josh were both very friendly with Jane, but it was Brad who first seized an opportunity. He approached the ravishing woman during an afternoon class and begged her for a ride home after work. Brad told her that he and Josh normally went home together, as they lived together, but he stated Josh had an important appointment downtown that afternoon and needed their car. 

It was a little uncomfortable at first with a strange man in the car, as she always drove home alone. Brad used his youthful enthusiasm and friendly demeanor to put Jane at ease. Soon they chatted back and forth about the school and in particular some of the kids. Once Jane started talking about her students, she was totally at ease and more than willing to chat with Brad. A friendship evolved with her young trainee and Jane welcomed Brad's readily offered praise about her teaching abilities. 

The young man kidded his buddy about the way he managed to catch some valuable alone time with the sexy teacher. Josh even called him a dirty scoundrel, yet it didn't deter Brad, as he focused on learning more about Jane. Later in the week, Brad pulled the same stunt again. About half way home, he asked Jane to stop at a mini-mall, as he had dry-cleaning to pickup. When Brad offered to buy her a treat for being so helpful, she accepted. 

Having a young man who seemed to dote over her was something Jane wasn't used to. Then Josh's smiling face came to mind and Jane realized that there were two men being overly friendly and showing her much needed admiration. With her marriage sort of on rocky ground, it was nice to have Brad and Josh around her, as they built her self-confidence with constant compliments. 

Jane sat down with Brad in a coffee shop and they had a nice quiet chitchat. She wasn't big on drinking caffeine in the late afternoon, but relented just to make the young man happy. First the talk about school and classes removed her barriers and then Brad cleverly switched topics. He told her that his longtime girlfriend who he dated since the first year of college had just broken up with him. When a tear ran out the corner of his eye, Brad's deception totally captivated his teacher. 

Jane actually grabbed his hand, which was conveniently left in the middle of the table, and she comforted the heartbroken young man. "It's okay. You'll get over it. You're a handsome young man and there will be another woman... many other women," she whispered. "I'm sure it's for the best." 

Brad played the sympathy card with an academy performance. He stared across the table with puppy-dog eyes and squeezed Jane's warm, comforting hand, pretending her compassion put a faint smile on his sad face. "I appreciate someone who is so loving and affectionate... like you. You're always so happy and positive," he whispered. "I know that if I ever had a woman like you, it would be the happiest day of my life." 

Her heart fluttered and if they had been alone, Jane was sure that she would have embraced the young man. Not because of any sexual attraction, but because she felt sorry for him. "I know how it is when someone hurts you. I... well my marriage isn't that great these days," she said. Then she sort of paused for a few moments because she wasn't sure why she blurted out such a personal detail. 

Jane knew it was unwise to tell Brad that her relationship was in the doldrums the past two years. She never saw his ears perk-up and his racing heart was totally unnoticeable because Brad was closing in on the seductive prey. "It really means a lot to me that you are so open... so honest with me. I've had this hurt for days and thought I was the only one in the world going through a breakup." 

Jane quickly corrected him, but the damage had already been done. "Oh no, I'm not breaking up with my husband. We're just... well, going through a difficult time," she stuttered. "I'm still in love with my husband." As soon as she said it, Jane wondered if it was true. 

Brad seized the opportunity, realizing it might be his last. He consoled Jane and hoped his sudden eagerness didn't scare her. They chatted for a while longer about her husband and parents and Brad acted like he was a devoted family man. When Jane told the young man about her husband going to a big Solar Convention in Las Vegas in a couple of weeks, she never realize the revelation might come back to haunt her. 

Then Jane told the young man that the real problem in her marriage was the result of her wanting to have a baby. She desperately wanted to start a family, as they weren't getting any younger, and her husband's priorities were still on his career. Her disclosures were a godsend and Brad realized the beautiful teacher was ripe for the picking. 

Brad watched her face light up every time he gave her a flattering remark and he was positive Jane never suspected he was trying to seduce her. "I know you have to get home," Brad said. "But I have something that I want you to have. Something that means a lot to me, but I want you to have," he whispered. "It's in my apartment... so just give me a second when you drive me home. I'll run up and get it." 

Jane was late and didn't really want to delay getting home. She felt sorry for the young man, as he appeared devastated by the loss of his girlfriend. "Yes, I am very late. I guess if I'm a little later, it won't hurt." 

They left the coffee shop and went directly to Brad's apartment. "I'll just be a second. You can wait at the entrance." She followed Brad into his building and stood at the door while he rushed into the apartment. When he returned, there was a gold necklace dangling from his hand, which he held up for her. "This was given to my mother by my father who passed away when I was ten. I want you to have it." 

Then the most enchanting thing happened. Brad held the necklace and with one hand sort of turned her around. He stood behind her and proceeded to put the chain around her neck. Just as he locked the clasp, Brad bent over and kissed her neck right where the clasp rested. He kissed the back of her neck and then each side, as her feet remained riveted to the spot. 

Brad leaned forward and put his lips next to her ear. "I'll be here for you. If you need a shoulder, or someone to talk to, I'll be here," he whispered. "You mean a lot to me and I'll do anything in the world to make you happy." 

Jane truly appreciated Brad's passionate response, but it would never do for a married woman to be romantically involved with someone from work, especially someone who was about ten years her junior. She wondered what would happen if they were alone in a totally secluded spot. Jane imagined being in the young man's strong arms and him hugging her. Then she shuddered when images of them being intimate and her actually allowing Brad to kiss her on the lips. 

She fully intended on thanking him, as it was one of the nicest things anyone had done to her, but instead she rushed out of the building. She ran to her car and didn't slowdown until she was seated behind the wheel. Brad's loving touch and his amorous embrace put goosebumps all over her body. She drove and couldn't forget the feeling of the young man's lips on her neck or his loving words. 

The drive home from Brad's was lonely and she welcomed the solitude. Jane thought about her husband and some of the problems they were having the past couple of years. They had gotten married young, in fact right out of high school, and after years of marriage it seemed they might not have known each other all that well. Although they had agreed to pursue careers, she was now ready for a family. 

Suddenly the newly developing friendship with the bright young man gave her the determination to improve her own marriage. Jane vowed to put forth a concerted effort to get along better with her husband. The one very concerning aspect was the fact that the only time she was radiant and happy was when she was at school. She loved all of her students, even the bad ones. She also craved the friendships with all of the other teachers, including the four new trainees. 

*** 

Josh was full of youthful self-assurance and getting rejected never entered his mind. From the first moment he saw Jane, he realized there was something different about the woman. It was true that he found the bet with Brad very tempting, but in the end his male urges had already won out. Every time he looked at Jane he felt something quiver in the pit of his stomach, which in reality caused his male urges to come alive. Josh looked forward to each day at noon hour when he normally met Jane in the teacher's lunchroom. He felt extremely comfortable being around Jane and he sensed that she welcomed his friendly company. 

One afternoon after the bet, Brad did him the biggest favor. He mentioned how Jane drove him home and during their relaxed conversation it came up that she was experiencing some marital problems. Josh wasn't surprised and he correctly assumed Jane's timid lack of confidence stemmed from her husband's mean behavior. He couldn't understand how a man married to such a gorgeous woman wouldn't shower her with love and devotion. 

Josh found it funny that a beautiful and adorable woman wouldn't know how desirable she was to the opposite sex. He took the time to study Jane and decided to hold nothing back when he put the moves on her. The way her face lit up and she seemed to relish any attention given her made Josh realize how much a woman appreciated being loved and praised. It made him chuckle to discover that certain sayings were absolutely true. The way to a man's heart was through his eyes, but for a woman it was through her ears. 

One time during class preparation when there was just the two of them in the room, Josh purposely rubbed against Jane. That alone wasn't too daring, but it was the fact he sported a raging hard-on at the time that encouraged his bold actions. Josh wasn't positive, yet he assumed Jane didn't move away when he brushed against her because she wanted it as badly as he did. His confidence grew by the minute, thinking that such a sexy white woman wanted to experience something sinful and absolutely naughty. 

Josh strongly believed that his being black gave him the upper hand over Brad and he planned taking full advantage of his unique heritage. Since Jane never displayed any outward rejection for his brazen move, Josh touched or rubbed against her whenever he had a chance. His desire and passion for the alluring teacher eventually turned into an obsession, which caused him to throw caution to the wind. 

The noon hour meetings served as the foundation for a growing relationship and even Brad sensed his best friend was gaining the upper hand. He noticed how the two seemed overly comfortable around each other and when they were together, no one else in the room seemed to matter. Josh developed a sense of urgency after Brad's daring ride home with Jane so he realized that holding back wasn't a good option. 

One afternoon Jane received the biggest shock of her life. She asked Josh who was assisting in her class for the week if he would help her construct a special reading program. The students were working hard on an assignment while the two teachers worked on a specific demonstration at the back of the classroom. Jane had brushed off all of the bold young man's, juvenile harassment and she actually pretended Josh's actions were merely inadvertent groping. She did feel a little guilty for not rejecting Josh's unwanted touching, but in reality she feared missing something that might happen once in a lifetime. 

Up until that afternoon, Jane believed Josh was simply being immature and that she was under no danger of being seduced. She did however find the thought extremely enthralling that a handsome black man found her attractive. Jane never dreamed that being out of the dating scene for so many years might leave her naïve and unaware. 

When Josh touched her that afternoon with what appeared to be a growing hard- on, Jane decided that his unwanted molesting had to stop. She swiftly turned and faced him with the sternest expression on her worried face. Jane opened her mouth to scold the young man and then his deep, brown eyes burned a hole through her spirit. There was a smile on his handsome face and suddenly she lost all of her courage. Josh was different and she wasn't certain why her inner being seemed to quiver every time she was with the young man. 

Jane wasn't sure how long she stood staring into the dark, paralyzing eyes, but it felt like an eternity. Without warning, the class resumed and she had to go attend to her students. The rest of the afternoon was a complete daze, as Jane didn't know where she was or what she was doing. She tried to reason why she let things progress to the point where the young men felt sure enough of himself to display his sexual desire. What Jane did do was vow to not let it happen again and she did blame herself for not controlling matters. 

*** 

Two days later, one of the most memorable experiences of Josh's life happened by accident. He went with Jane to get some supplies from one of the many storerooms at the school. They were in the secluded room with the door closed when Jane reached up to get something off a high shelf. This beautiful, sexy woman reached up, standing on her tiptoes, and she was too much for Josh to resist. 

He stood behind Jane with his fiery eyes glued on the back of her head. He reached forward, putting his big hands on top of hers, and pinned her hands firmly on the high shelf. Josh's lips brushed her ear and his burning breath washed across her flushed cheek, which seemed to be red-hot. "Don't move. I've wanted to touch you... feel you ever since the first time we met." 

The only thing she was able to do was let out long, desperate gasps. Her regret was twofold. Jane knew if she didn't stop things immediately, she would live to regret it. She also knew it was wrong to standstill, yet by stopping Josh she would regret missing a once in a lifetime experience. The young man's hot breath continued washing across her blushing cheek and it paralyzed every muscle in her body. 

When Josh moved his right hand, Jane remained motionless with her hands permanently glued to the shelf. He carefully pulled her blouse out of the waistband of her skirt and left her panting for more air. Jane would never believe that she sucked in her tummy allowing Josh to easily pull up her blouse. Then he let go with his other hand and now she was totally free to escape. Her brain screamed, 'run, run and get away, you fool!' 

Her legs remained stiff and her toes were nailed to the floor. The standing position with her arms outstretched allowed the young man to easily slip his hand under her misaligned bra. Abruptly her right breast was in his hand and being caressed in a rough, desperate fashion. Her enlarged nipple was between Josh's fingers and he rolled it around like a marble in oil. "Your tits... I mean breasts are gorgeous, sexy... so luscious." 

It had been years since she had felt such lust. They seldom had sex anymore, as her husband seemed disinterested and too busy with his growing business. Suddenly her left breast was fondled and Josh's fingers instantly surround the hardened nipple. Josh sort of cupped both boobs in his big palms and used his strong fingers to caress and squeeze the erect nipples. She couldn't remember the last time her body yearned for something or when she felt such a burning desire. 

Jane realized that it was imperative to move real soon or the young man would have her undressed. Knowing it might be the biggest disappointment of her life, Jane yanked her hands off of the bookshelf. She turned around quickly and at the same time straightened her clothing. "I'm so sorry. I should never have let this happen," she whispered, with a stern tone to her quivering voice. "Please, we must stop."  

===

The 18th day of September would forever be engrained in her memory. "Give me your hand," Josh whispered. He simply grabbed her dainty hand, acting like it was the most compassionate and caring thing he had ever done. Jane expected the young man to apologize and then leave, but to her profound amazement that never happened. Josh stared at her and his dark, mesmerizing eyes turned her stomach to quicksand. 

In one swift and shrewd move, Josh shoved her hand into his pants. One second Jane expected an end to the sudden affair and the next second her hand rested directly on top of something long, hard and pulsing. She was positive her legs collapsed involuntarily, as the next thing she was aware of was being in the arms of an overpowering young man. Her hand twisted slightly, which enabled her fingers to wrap around the throbbing penis, and every heartbeat radiated straight up her arm. 

His voice was soft and tender. "I'm going to make love to you," Josh whispered, kissing the side of her face. "You're so beautiful inside... and outside and I want to be your lover." 

Her heart beat so fast and furious and Jane wasn't sure what to do. Josh thrust his hips forward, which pressed her hand and his hardness into her shivering midsection. For some reason her head rolled backwards and she saw his face at the last moment. Her mouth opened to take a breath and then she was kissed. Jane stopped breathing, but her heart raced. She felt her temperature rising and suddenly her head started ringing so loud that it made her temples pound madly. 

In her hand was the first stranger's cock she had touched since getting married and Jane marveled at how large it seemed compared to her husband's. How often had she dreamed of seeing... of touching a big cock like those in porno movies that she had reluctantly watched with her husband over the years? She was like most women who didn't think much about the size of a man's unit; yet there was something about Josh being black that added a profound, philosophical aspect to the secret storeroom affair. 

Jane wasn't aware of how she wound up against the wall. She knew it wasn't her feet that moved, as her entire body was petrified by the sudden incidence. All of a sudden her skirt was up around her waist the there was a stranger's hand inside her panties. Josh deftly thrust his forefinger under the edge of her cotton garment and in a split second his hand covered her precious mound. 

Jane jerked her head sideways and broke the kiss. She desperately gasped for air and tried to come to her senses in a hurry. "Dear gawd, we can't. We have to stop this instant," she said. "Gawd, what's come over me?" 

Josh was thankful for the brief encounter with the one woman he adored. "Yes, we have to stop... someone might come along and catch us," he said, but he hesitated. 

It took a few seconds before she could breathe normal again. "Oh gawd, what have I done?" she wondered out loud. "I'm so sorry... it's my fault." Jane quickly straightened her blouse and skirt and brushed them a few times to take out some of the obvious wrinkles. 

Without warning, Josh put his finger under her chin and raised her head so he could look her in the eyes. "You must do one thing for me." 

Jane stared back into his dark, mystifying eyes. Her first instinct was to run from the room, but something in his eyes prevented her fleeing. She merely looked at the young man, as if pleading for him to ask that special favor. 

Josh waited until Jane appeared ready. "You are the sexiest woman alive and I dearly want to make love to you." Then he decided to take a big chance. "Shave for me. Make a fresh start and shave... be shaved when we make love." 

Jane listened, but she was too astounded to say anything right away. His request was probably the stupidest thing she had ever heard; yet a tremor shot up her entire body. Jane visualized a razor being handed to her and then she obediently fulfilled the young man's dream. She almost blurted out a response she might have regretted the rest of her life. Instead she took the sane path of a mature, married woman. "Please Josh, this is wrong. People are probably already suspicious because we've been in here so long," she whispered. "We must get back to the classroom." 

Each looked at their watch. There was still a little less than ten minutes before the next class, which was barely enough time to get prepared for her students. Jane exited the room in a hurry and went straight to the ladies room in an effort to regain her senses. 

*** 

Brad suspected his buddy had gained valuable headway, as Josh appeared to be in Jane's good books. The two were often together between classes and suddenly Josh wasn't bragging about his accomplishments like he used to with every contest the two had in the past. Brad was at the far end of the hallway when Jane came out of the storage room the other day and he noticed her flushed and misused appearance. Then Josh exited the room shortly after Jane and Brad was positive his buddy had at least copped a feel of the sexy teacher. 

Brad's suspicions were confirmed the next weekend when the two spent a Saturday night barhopping. The two buddies consumed more than enough alcohol by midnight and even continued drinking after they got home. Each beer loosened Josh's tongue and built his ego. The two buddies razed each other back and forth and eventually Brad brought up his favorite topic. "How's it going with Jane?" 

"Good! She's a nice lady and I respect her a lot." 

"Yeah, yeah, but how did it go in the storeroom? I saw you coming out with the biggest grin on your face." 

"We just talked... nothing else!" 

"I call bullshit, bro." 

The beers were going down easy and both men felt no pain. Josh squirmed in his chair unable to come to grips with his dilemma. He would do anything in the world for his best buddy, but suddenly he had nagging doubts. He hated the thought of squealing on Jane and didn't want to kiss and tell. His drunken state seemed to give Josh enough courage to express his reluctance to continue their boyish contest. "Hey, bro, I've gotten to know Jane and well... I've changed my mind." 

Brad was dumbfounded. He suspected his buddy liked the teacher, but never realized how much. "Call it off if you want. Go ahead, man, but I'm still going to bang her." 

"Hell, she's a nice lady. Let's leave her be." 

"She's a poor married woman who feels sorry for herself. Hell, she probably hasn't been properly fucked in weeks... in months." 

"It wouldn't be right if we jeopardized her marriage, or career." 

"She needs a royal screwing and I plan on giving it to her. When I wave my prick at her, she'll get on her hands and knees and wave that delicious ass at me." 

"Geez, I think we should leave her alone." 

"So what do those luscious tits feel like? I know you copped a feel; you lucky bastard." 

Josh was too tipsy to know better. "Wow, they're the best... so soft, yet firm and those bloody nip..." 

Brad noticed his buddy catch himself, but the damage had already been done. "Christ man, you're the luckiest bastard. What about that pussy? Don't tell me you felt that too." 

The beers had loosened Josh's tongue and it wagged a tale of lost desire. "Oh bro, I've never met a woman like her. I fucking near blew my load." 

Brad observed the telltale signs and knew Josh had succeeded in fondling the seductive teacher. "So tell me. Did she feel your rod? I bet that put a big smile on her face." 

By the end of the night, Brad knew enough about the secret encounter. He was a little surprised at Josh's ability to seduce the sexy teacher, but the information was just what he needed. The night ended with the two reconfirming their childish bet, although Josh was very hesitant. Even in his drunken condition, Josh questioned his fortitude of actually going all the way with Jane. He was slightly consoled by believing that neither of them would be able to seduce the innocent teacher. 

*** 

The next day of school, it was Brad who acted. It was his turn in the classroom with Jane and he planned a manipulative blackmail, which he knew would turn the sexy teacher into his obedient puppet. He waited until a class ended to get Jane alone and then he pounced. "I know I'm being a big bother, but can I catch another ride home tonight?" 

Jane had made up her mind to stop acting improperly with both young men so she responded right away. "Gee, I'm sorry, but I have something planned that I really can't get out of." 

"Really?" 

The look on the young man's face turned her stomach to jelly. "Yea... Yeaaass." 

"Well you might want to reconsider, as I have something very important that I want to talk to you about." 

"I made this appointment a long time ago." She didn't like lying, but it seemed the only way out of a situation that was growing into a dilemma. 

Brad stared into her eyes and noticed her resolve starting to diminish. "You see... I know about the storeroom. I don't think you want the principal or hubby to find out, do you?" 

"Nothing happened. There's nothing... nothing that you can use." Jane looked at the young man and the confident grin on his face quickly robbed her last bit of willpower. "Please, nothing really happened." 

"I'll meet you at your car after work," Brad whispered. Then he quickly turned and left her standing at her desk with a confused expression written on her worried face. 

The rest of the day was a blur, as she didn't know what Brad was after. He sounded serious and Jane couldn't believe the man had suddenly changed. Brad had always seemed warm and caring, but all of a sudden he appeared cunning and more devious than anyone she knew. At quitting time, she went to the parking lot, praying for a salvation that she knew would never come. 

When Jane neared her car, the sight of Brad standing beside it sent shivers down her spine. She decided to put on a brave face and tried hard to remain calm, as she got into the car. Hesitantly she unlocked the passenger door and the young man slowly got into the car. He merely looked at her and didn't say a word. 

Nothing was said for the first minute or two. Jane drove towards Brad's apartment, hoping to get there as quickly as possible. "I know what happened in the storeroom. I know about the fun-time you had with Josh," Brad said, as he stared at her. 

Without looking away from the road, Jane knew the young man was looking at her. "Please, Brad, nothing happened." 

"Look, honey! Let's get one thing straight. I don't like it when you bullshit me and I don't like it when you tell me a boldfaced lie." 

Jane was still confused. "Please, why are you doing this?" She trusted Josh and couldn't understand how Brad knew about the secret indiscretions. 

Brad noticed the totally bewildered look on Jane's pretty face. He marveled at how quickly Josh and Jane had grown intimately close, but he still craved one thing. "Don't worry. Your boyfriend's too goddamn naïve. When Josh drinks too much, he loses the ability to think straight... and he's a piss poor liar. He's like my brother and I know when he's hot for a woman," he said. "Hell, he probably can't remember getting so drunk and telling me everything." 

Jane glanced at the young man and at once realized she had profound feelings for someone new in her life. "But there's nothing between Josh and I." 

Brad glared at her. "Look sweetheart, I know he felt you up right in the school." 

Jane glanced over and into the steadfast eyes and there was no leniency. She realized that there was nothing she could say to appease the young man. "But, but it was nothing, really." 

"Look, honey. Do you want anyone finding out?" 

Suddenly she couldn't look at Brad. "No. No." 

"Hey, don't blame your boyfriend. Josh can't handle his liquor and he was a babbling idiot after a few beers," Brad said, before sending the final volley. "I bet that black cock felt good, didn't it?" 

"What do you want from me?" It was over. Her struggle was over and Jane knew the young man could blackmail her into doing almost anything. 

Brad made the smartest decision when he assumed Jane would sacrifice herself for someone she treasured. He knew she would hesitate risking her career or her marriage, but she would do anything in her power to save someone she loved. "I'm doing this for one thing... and one thing only. To get into your pants!" 

When he said it, Jane felt totally overwhelmed with the thought that Brad planned to blackmail her. "You're crazy... you're mad!" 

Luckily they arrived at Brad's, as Jane wasn't in any shape to drive. She parked and sat stoic, waiting for the young man to continue. "I know you threw your sexy ass at Josh... let him feel those luscious titties. Christ that black dick must have felt good?" Brad paused to give her a chance to reflect. "Josh didn't exactly say what happened, but I figured it out. And besides... the school board and your hubby will believe anything I say." 

Jane felt weak and totally consumed with guilt. He knew! She wondered about how much Brad knew and exactly how much Josh told him. She wondered if calling his bluff would work? It was strange how a guilty mind assumed the worst. Jane imagined the young man going to the principal and telling him about her indiscretions with Josh. She originally considered what happened as not that serious. "Please, it wasn't like that. Nothing really happened." 

Brad reached across the seat and twisted Jane's shoulders so he could look her in the eyes. "I said no fucking bullshit. What do you think Mr. Smith will say when he finds out his little angel is groping a student trainee in his goddamn storeroom? Putting her hands on a black dick right in the school." 

"Oh, Brad, please!" Jane's heart almost came out of her chest, as she realized the young man's blackmail was too overwhelming. Her pleas were practically an admission of guilt, but she didn't know what else to do. 

Brad saw the defeat written on her distraught face. He knew he guessed right and wanted to push her all the way to the edge. She squirmed in her seat and he laughed out loud. "What will hubby say when he finds out his darling wife is screwing around with some black dude?" He stared straight into the teary eyes. "And I'm sure they'll kick Josh's ass out of the program when they find out he's dicking one of his supervisors, right in the school." 

Jane wanted to disappear. If her life ended at that moment, she would have been satisfied. She looked at the young man and didn't notice any wavering or any softening in his blackmail demands. She didn't know which was worse? If parents or the school board found out, her career was finished; if her husband found out, her marriage was finished; if she didn't do what Brad demanded, Josh would be punished. "What do you want? What do you want from me?" 

"I'm glad you see the light. I promise not to tell anyone about you and Josh. Your career is safe and so is his." Brad leaned forward and grabbed one of her hands. Then he slipped a small piece of paper in the palm of her dainty hand. "This will explain in detail... when and where you will meet me on Friday. Since your husband will be away for the weekend, the timing couldn't be better." 

Jane glanced at the satisfied grin on Brad's face, as her eyes filled with tears. She cursed the fact of naively telling the young man that her husband was going to a National Solar Convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The devious young man had won and it was little consolation of not having to make excuses for being away from home. Jane was willing to do whatever it took to keep Brad quiet. She didn't want to get fired by the school or divorced by her husband. Also, she would do anything to protect an innocent young man who she had grown fond of, so there was only one way out of the drastic dilemma. 

When he turned and left the car, Jane's heart pounded harder in her chest. She slowly straightened her fingers and opened the piece of paper. 'To my beautiful sweetheart,' was written. Before this unexpected blackmail scheme, Jane would have felt love and admiration for a young man who she once considered a true friend. Now she hated Brad, but realized it must not get in the way of her sanity. 

'We will spend an entire evening together... just you and me at my apartment. Be here at 7 o'clock, Friday evening. Don't be late or if you don't show up, you'll be forever sorry.' Through tears, it was hard to read the blurry note. 'I give my word that everything will be forgotten once my desire is fulfilled. I've dreamed of nothing else, but having sex with the sexiest teacher.' There was a last line, which sent a shiver through her entire body. 'Please wear the necklace I gave you.' 

*** 

The night lasted an eternity and Jane was completely exhausted when she went to school the next day. She hardly slept with her mind distraught over the impending dilemma and she feared meeting the two young interns again. Jane felt intimidated by Brad and utterly powerless to resist his blackmail demands. During the many nightmares she experienced through the night, her choices seemed quite simple. Either she met with Brad on Friday, allowing the scoundrel to have sex with her, or she didn't meet with him, refusing his blackmail instructions. 

Jane was proud of the fact she never had an affair or even considered being unfaithful during her ten years of marriage. Now she either became an adulteress or she would be absolutely humiliated by losing her job. She dreaded meeting Brad at school. Her fate rested in the hands of the devil and there was also one other dire consideration, which caused her much agony. She wasn't taking any form of birth control and the possibility of getting pregnant with such a vile man was utterly demoralizing. The one consoling fact was that she had just finished her period, which meant she was relatively safe, but the thought still depressed her. 

Without a viable alternative, she went to work feeling like a woman without any control over her future. Her decision was made during the long night and she wasn't happy about meeting Brad on Friday. Jane readily eliminated any inclination of telling her husband about Brad's blackmail, as the thought was too disgraceful. Luckily her husband was leaving for Vegas within a few hours so he wouldn't notice her extreme anxiety or nervousness leading up to the Friday night rendezvous. 

Jane also feared meeting Josh and being alone with him again, but for entirely different reasons. She couldn't recall being so intimately affected by anyone or anything in her life. Jane felt a desperate need to talk to someone and it seemed that her and her husband never confided in each other anymore. Her first impulse was to divulge the details of the approaching nightmare to the young man, but she couldn't garner up enough courage. 

There were deep-rooted feelings inside that Jane believed made Josh different, but she hesitated letting her emotions get carried away. She decided to act like nothing happened, yet realized it would be difficult to pretend there was nothing intimate between the two. She deemed it was her fault for what happened, which allowed Brad to gain the overpowering control, and to protect Josh it was crucial he didn't know about the impending blackmail. 

The morning classes passed without anything eventful happening, but that soon changed at noon hour. Jane was standing at her desk getting ready for lunch and Josh appeared out of nowhere. "I missed you. I've waited all morning to see you." 

Jane was too shocked to say anything. She froze and stood absolutely motionless, staring down at the papers on her desk. She didn't dare look at the young man of her dreams for fear of falling under his mysterious spell. "Uuuugh?"  

===

"Whenever I'm with you, I feel good," Josh whispered. Jane remained still and stared straight ahead, but her eyes may as well have been closed. His lips were against her ear and his voice was merely a faint whisper. "I've never felt this way... about anyone!" 

"No! Dear gawd, no. I'm not that kind of woman... I'm married," she moaned. "It's my fault for leading you on. I should never have done that." 

Josh had to look into her eyes again and see for himself. He grabbed her shoulders and spun her around. When they came face to face, Josh stared into her shinny, brown eyes. "I can wait... forever if need be," he whispered. 

Being not only a married woman, but also a mature teacher, Jane understood the severe consequences of acting inappropriately. She had already erred in more ways than she could count and she vowed to do whatever it took to end the sinful matter before it worsened. It took every ounce of courage to not throw herself into Josh's arms. "We can't... it's wrong." 

One big thing still bothered Josh. He decided it was best to warn Jane about Brad's unwavering determination, even if it caused a serious break in their growing relationship. "Aaah. Please be careful around Brad. He's a great guy, but he can get... eerrr, get very persuasive if he finds a woman desirable," he whispered. "And Brad has his sights set on you, so please be careful." 

Jane felt the strongest urge to tell Josh about the blackmail, but her overpowering guilt prevented any revelation. She looked into his eyes and resisted the impulse to fall into his strong arms. When he suggested they go to the lunchroom, she gladly accepted, as being alone with the young man was frustrating. 

Acting like nothing happened or that there was nothing between the two was difficult, but necessary as far as Jane was concerned. She sat with Josh in the staff lunchroom, feeling more and more sure of her feelings for the young man. Every time he spoke to her or looked into her eyes, she felt her heart do a double beat and her face seemed to flush. She was utterly mystified by the strong desire for intimate contact with Josh, but vowed to resist the temptation, knowing it would only make matters worse. With Brad's impending rendezvous on the horizon, she didn't need any further turmoil in her life. 

*** 

The day leading up to the blackmail rendezvous was the worst day of her life. She couldn't remember experiencing more mental anguish and her students must have thought she had lost her mind. Finally she simply gave them reading assignments, which left her alone to wallow in decadence. 

When she went home from school, she was distraught with the realization that by night's end she would be an adulteress. Having her husband away for the weekend saved her coming up with a viable excuse for spending Friday night out; yet she was still bothered by overpowering guilt. Her husband often encouraged Jane to go out with her girlfriends, but she seldom did because she felt uncomfortable going out without her husband. 

Jane fought hard to dress for the horrible journey, not wanting to give Brad any more satisfaction. She decided on a very conservative skirt and blouse. Underneath was the least sexy underwear she owned and she prayed for the courage to go through with the drastic adventure. She had grown fairly fond of Brad, but his sudden blackmail had definitely changed her opinion of the young man. 

She approached Brad's apartment building with so many butterflies in her stomach that it felt very uncomfortable. Walking up to the front door, Jane hesitated before ringing the doorbell. Without warning the door opened and she glared straight at the biggest grin on Brad's youthful face. "I'm glad you're here. You look gorgeous, very beautiful!" 

Jane realized the evening would be one of twofaced action. Both her good-side and her bad-side would be talking. 'Yeah, sure asshole! What choice did I have?' Then she smiled and actually spoke out loud. "Thank you. Please, before we get started. I can't afford to get pregnant so we can stop right now unless you have protection." 

"Not to worry. I fully understand. Here, let's start off on the right foot," he said, handing her a glass of wine. "A toast and I promise that by the end of the night, you'll be a happy, happy woman." 

'Right asshole! Like wine is going to make me feel better.' She tried her best to smile when she took the glass from Brad. "Yes, I could use a drink, thanks," she replied. 

"Come, I'm sure you could use something to snack-on, as well," he said. Then they moved into his living room, which was set up with romantic lighting, soft music and some finger-food. On the second glass of wine, she was feeling a little more relaxed and thankfully a lot less worried. Brad wisely kept the conversation on her life and on her past teaching experiences. He was well aware that Jane would let her guard down when she talked about her young students. 

Brad also insisted they talk about her family and after another wine, Jane was feeling a little tipsy. They sat on the sofa and Brad suggested they retire to a much better location. He refreshed their glasses and ushered Jane up to his bedroom dungeon. 'Fucking lovely! The bastard is getting ready to mount me,' she surmised. 

When Brad reached for her blouse, she wrapped her free arm around her chest to indicate her reluctance. Brad quickly set both glasses on a nearby dresser and turned Jane around so he was behind her. "You have such lovely skin... soft and so velvety." 

"Dear gawd, I've never cheated..." 

"I know. I could tell," Brad whispered. "Any man would be crazy not to desire you... such a gorgeous, sexy woman." 

Jane kept quiet, as she reached for the buttons on her blouse, but the little voice in her head couldn't stop talking. 'Well let's get it over with real quick. Take me you bastard; then I can get out of here.' 

Her fingers vibrated like crazy and she only managed to undo two or three buttons before Brad pushed her hands away. "Slow, take it slow. I want this to last a long, long time." Then he reached around her and slowly unbuttoned her blouse. Brad pressed his body against her back and kept his mouth next to her ear. "You deserve the best." 

'Right asshole! And I bloody hope you don't consider yourself in that category.' Jane stood rigid and tried hard to not protest or say anything, as the young man put his hands all over the front of her body. Brad caressed her from her neck down to her tummy and cleverly left her bra on when he caressed her boobs one at a time. 

Brad paid special attention to the ends and felt the nipples pushing out against the soft fabric. "You have outstanding breasts... nipples that I can't stop dreaming about." 

'Dammit, I hate when they do that. Now the rotten bastard will think he made my nipples erect.' Then it came to her. If he wouldn't let her undress, she had to use other means to make the unwanted sex go faster. "Mmmmm... mmmm, that feels nice." 

Suddenly it was Brad's turn. The little voice in his head spoke to him, which increased his confidence. 'Right, honey! Fake it and make me believe you want it real bad.' 

"Mmmm... mmmm, I like that." 

'Yeah, I bet you do. Well, keep faking it, honey. Once we get down to the nitty-gritty, you'll prove you're a slut, once and for all.' Brad's face grinned, as he listened intently to his supportive little partner. 'Christ, I almost want to rip your fucking clothes off and see all of that ball-busting body.' He slowly rolled the bra upwards, freeing the luscious boobs. Then he put the two erect buds in his fingers and rolled both of them around and around. 

'Damn, why do they always get so bloody hard?' Jane rolled her head backwards and rested it on Brad's shoulder. "Mmmm... mmmm, that feels good," she moaned trying to use her sexiest voice. 

Brad kissed her ear and all the way down her neck. 'Yeah, I bet it does. Keep moaning, my love. I have a big surprise for you, so keep faking it.' He squeezed the nipples a little harder and felt them get even harder. "You have such a sexy body. Your nipples are absolutely the best... hummmm outstanding!" 

Jane wanted it over. She reached for her skirt and managed to undo the zipper and button. Then before she was aware of what Brad was doing, she was guided across the room. She opened her eyes and about three feet in front of her bewildered eyes was a reflection of a struggling couple. Her blouse was completely open and her bra was bunched almost around her neck. It was her boobs that drew the most ire. She watched Brad's fingers roll the swollen nipples around and swore at the obvious inflamed state of her buds. 

She felt Brad's eyes and glanced a little higher into the large, wall-length mirror. Still behind her, Brad had his face next to her ear, as he stared back at her. "We both get to watch," he whispered, giving her ear a taunting flick with his tongue. His face was very serious when he held the steady gaze. "Watch the sexy teacher cream like a little schoolgirl." 

'You're fucking dreaming, asshole, if you think I'm going that far.' Jane stared at their reflection and into the dark eyes, wondering what Brad was doing. "Mmmm... mmmm." 

Brad let go of the enlarged nipples and finished taking off the skirt. Then he stripped the blouse and bra to leave her standing in unsightly nylons and panties. Jane let her glance shift to the awful image and she wondered if it was possible to look any un-sexier? Her white panties showed through the soft, beige hose and the sight made her shiver. When Brad slowly rolled the remaining garments down her legs, leaving them bunched at her feet, she shuddered at being left nude. 

"Sweet mother of Jesus... shaved pussy. You're shaved! I've dreamed of screwing a woman who does that." Brad moaned into her ear and Jane felt his obvious arousement pushing into her back. "You look absolutely gorgeous." 

The timing couldn't have been worse. She stared at the newly acquired look and realized her mistake. 'Dear gawd, why did I do that now?' Jane glared into the mirror at Brad whose tongue was hanging out of his mouth. 'I hope the bastard doesn't think I shaved for him. Dear gawd, why him?" Why can't it be...?' 

Jane had shaven her private region for the first time in her life. She stared at the illustrious spectacle and marveled at how the newfound exterior seemed to make her look tantalizing, even glamorous. Jane was still admiring her appearance when Brad acted. "It's time my love. Time to show me how you can climax in my arms," he whispered. "We're going to watch you masturbate." 

'Watch what? I don't think so, as I'm not the least bit aroused.' Jane returned her gaze to Brad and noticed the serious expression on his face. "Then will you let me go? If I do that, will you leave me alone?" 

His warm smile turned into an evil grin. "We'll see. If you're real good, maybe I'll just jerkoff and call it a night," Brad said. He watched the frown on her pretty face turn to optimism, as the devil spoke to him again. 'Get to work slut. Watching you get yourself off is going to be the greatest. Then you're going to suck my cock and I'll blow my fucking load down your sexy-ass throat.' 

"I'm not sure... not sure if I can do it. I've never masturbated... in front of someone," Jane moaned. Once again it was her conscience that made her appear naïve and gullible. "Really, I don't think I can do it." 

"You'll have to trust me. Once you've satisfied my sexual desire, I'll let you go home. So make it good and you'll be out of here a lot quicker," Brad explained. "Do it! Show me what that shaved beauty can do." 

Jane closed her eyes, unable to watch. The thought of actually masturbating in front of a stranger was horrific, but it was being able to observe the satisfied grin on Brad's face when she did it that caused her the most misery. "I don't think I can." 

Abruptly her ear was on fire, as Brad used his sharp teeth to get her full attention. "Open your beautiful eyes. You're going to watch it all with me," he whispered through his teeth. "Watch you molest that gorgeous pussy. Be a good girl and masturbate!" 

She obeyed, as there didn't seem to be any alternative. Her arms were aided until they reached downward and her hands were wittingly guided to her shivering pelvis. Nothing seemed real to Jane. Her fingers tenderly caressed the velvety skin and her eyes opened wider when she noticed something glistening between her legs. Without warning her feet were nudged apart and she found it hard to control her trembling fingers. 

"That's a good girl. Can you see it?" Brad stared at the opening between Jane's legs and noticed the definite outline of the prettiest pink lips. "I've never seen anything so sexy... so enthralling." 

Jane noticed it too. Brad had kicked her feet far enough apart that her labia were visible. Almost in a trancelike state, she watched her dainty fingers dip into the tempting space until her precious jewel was covered. She paused for a few seconds, wondering how to display womanly lust without actually experiencing it. 'Oh, gawd, can I fake it and make him believe I'm having an orgasm?' 

Brad observed the hesitation and didn't mind the short reprieve. His emotions were riding a roller coaster and rising at a tremendous rate, which would spoil his plans. He willed up some extra self-control and used his subconscious male ego to stave off any premature climax. Again the silent voice spoke. 'Take your time, honey. We're going to be here all night and when you go home to papa, you'll have a belly full of jizz. There'll be no goddamn rubber on this cowboy!' 

Jane cupped her clean-shaven mound and moved her hand back and forth. When she watched the obvious masturbation attempt, she hoped it was enough to satisfy Brad's perverted desire. Then she glanced up and into the young man's unyielding eyes again. It wasn't going good so she opened her mouth. "Ooohhh... ooohhh gaaaawd." She jerked her hips, hoping Brad was satisfied. 

"Show me that gorgeous pussy. Spread those girlie-lips and show me that magnificent clitty!" Brad smiled, but it was his eyes that forced her to react. 

Jane slowly placed her forefinger and middle fingers of her left hand on her labia. The images would be forever photographed in her mind. Her fingers pulled the puffy lips apart and exposed the pink clitoris. It was extremely hard to keep her eyes from fluttering, as they tended to roll backwards when her right hand moved. The fingers surrounded the little gem and this time her jerking hips were genuine. 'Oh geez, this might not be smart. Holy shit, that actually felt good,' she thought. 

Then she heaved and groaned a few times in a vain attempt at deception. "Aaah, aaah. Oooh... oooh gaaawd!" 

There was no more need for Brad to hold her arms so he grabbed the luscious boobs. Cupping the tits and molesting them sent shivers down his arms and straight up to his head. He caressed her and purposely left the nipples exposed so they were clearly visible in the mirror. "My God, you have the nicest breasts... the best nipples," he whispered, completely ignoring her impulsive fake excitement. "Now show me that pretty clitty... all of it!" 

Jane's eyes were very glassy and they shifted from one image to another. Brad's face was etched with animal desire and he stared at her in a threatening manner. A little lower she noticed her breasts being groped by the young man and it was more than obvious her nipples were extremely erect. Lower still and her entire body shuddered at the sight of pure lust. Her throbbing clitty was between her fingers and it was being rotated around in a wild, vigorous fashion. 

This time her dreamy eyes locked on the magic between her legs. Her body came up so that she was standing on her tiptoes and thankfully Brad's strong arms supported her for better balance. All of a sudden a tremendous spasm rocked through her body, which left some disbelief about her resolve. She uttered a few more moans for effect and abruptly things got out of control. 

Brad shoved his right hand down the front of her torso and closed his hand directly on top of hers. His fingers grasped her two fingers, which surrounded the throbbing morsel, and then he squeezed as hard as he could. "Don't look away. Watch it baby, watch it all." Brad cradled her head with his head and shoulder and forced her to watch the entire scene unfold, much to her dismay. 

It was the longest series of subconscious babbling and Jane listened very carefully to herself. 'Oh my, what was that? Oooh, hang-on girl, don't satisfy the bastard's pervert wishes.' She stared straight into the mirror, unable to tear her eyes off of the damning imagery. 'Yeow, that was a big one. Holy shit, he has his hand on mine. Oh no, he's... the dirty bugger is squeezing my fingers and oh gawd, he's squashing my thingy.' 

Tears filled her eyes when she felt her stamina slipping away. 'Dear gawd, he's jiggling my fingers and making it feel awful. Oh, geez, he's squeezing... pressing so hard. Stop! Oh, please stop. Oh, Brad, don't do that anymore.' Jane's eyes grew wider, as the many fingers became a blur. 'Oooh, I can't let it happen. He can't do it to me. No, I have to be strong!' 

Brad watched her pretty face twist and turn. He knew she was fighting for her life and loved every second, knowing it was all in vain. "Your fingers... masturbating like you were a little girl. Do you do this at home? Do you show hubby how much you love being an easy slut?" Brad nibbled on the back of her ear and used his tongue for affect. "God lady, I love watching you finger that shaved cunt. Cream for me! Show me how you love creaming." 

The fire in her eyes caused a severe inferno, deep inside her tummy. Brad's fingers held her hand on top of her clitty and refused to give her any reprieve. By now the little bud was swollen and it was firmly compressed between the many fingers. "Ouch! Owie, you're hurting me," she moaned in desperation. "Please, you're hurting me." 

Brad was far too shrewd for an innocent woman. He had long suspected Jane's romantic feelings for his best buddy were sincere and he used her intense guilt to his advantage. "I wish Josh could see his lovely goddess now," he whispered. At first Jane's mind was too frustrated and Brad's disclosure took time going from her subconscious to her conscious mind. "Josh is missing the best fuck of the century; the sexy teacher creaming like one of her little schoolgirls." 

It was the first time in her life that she orgasmed and cried at the same time. The agony of defeat was too much and tears ran down her cheeks. Brad punished her by revealing her guilt and then he seized physical control at just the right time. He let go of her boob with his left hand and wrapped his fingers into the long, curly hair on the back of her head. "Fuck for me, baby. Fuck that dirty cunt," he said, as he jerked her head back so hard it felt like most of her hair had been ripped out. "Finger that dirty cunt and cream all over." 

"No, dear gawd, no!" 

"Christ, look at yourself. The cum's running down your legs. The most beautiful sight in the world is a woman masturbating," Brad whispered. "You're the greatest." 

Right or wrong, she was long past caring. Jane's breathing was in rapid gasps and her stomach heaved in and out at a fantastic rate. "No, no, not like this." 

"Fucking right, babe. Finger that pussy and show me a slut." 

Jane tried to put Brad out of her mind, but that was the biggest mistake. Suddenly images of Josh popped into her conscious mind. His handsome face, the smile, the youthful physique and his honest sincerity pushed her over the top. It was the first time in her life that she had been unfaithful, but the justification was that it was with someone she cared deeply about. She felt the strong, agile black fingers on her intimate being and they caressed her in a manner, which was new to her. Her belly erupted and she coated the black fingers with loving cream, making the sinful affair somewhat moral.  

===

*** 

Jane collapsed, as her legs were no longer strong enough for her to remain standing. She wound up on Brad's bed and there was no way to comprehend what had just transpired in a stranger's bedroom. It took some time for her breathing to return to a normal state and by that time Brad was thoroughly aroused. The sexy, naked woman lay stretched out on his bed and there was one thing paramount in his mind. "The night is young. I believe that I have enough incriminating evidence against you to keep you here all night," he informed her. 

She had been both physically and mentally overpowered. Without enough willpower to resist the young man, Jane merely whispered what sounded like a feeble protest. "Brad, dear gawd, I've done what you've asked. Can't I go now?" 

"My love! I've watched you prance around the school for weeks, showing off that sexy body to anyone with a pulse," Brad said. "Christ, you're the horniest teacher in the whole goddamn school." 

"Brad, I'm not. I'm married and I'm not after anyone. It's not what you think." 

"Honey, after watching that fantastic masturbation, I need something hot and horny around my cock. I need a fucking 'BJ'." 

"A blowjob?" 

Brad proceeded to strip the clothes he had not already taken off and in a scant few seconds was down to his shorts. "I've dreamed of this since the first day in class." 

Jane glanced to the side and noticed the upstanding tent in the front of the young man's shorts. "Oooh, I'm not really good... I haven't done it for a long time." 

"Don't worry, love. Just wrap those luscious lips around my rod and nature will take over." 

Then Brad quickly stripped his shorts. His proud unit bobbed up and down and Jane stared in disbelief at the stellar cock. "Oh geez, oh geez." 

"Sweet mother, get that mouth over here. Hey, have you ever tried 69. We may as well go all the way." 

"What? I can't. I've never done that." 

"C'mon love, you won't be sorry!" 

Jane's head throbbed and it seemed she was too confused to think straight. She felt Brad's hands all over her body and before she knew what was happening, she was in the most vulnerable position. On her hands and knees, her knees were on either side of Brad's chest and she straddled his upper body in the most wanton fashion. There was a loud buzzing in her ears and Jane found it impossible to concentrate. 

She planted her hands on the bed, holding her upper body as high as possible. Jane tried to twist around and see what Brad was doing, but she couldn't see around her flared hips. Then what felt like a burning dagger touched her delicate crotch. "Suck it, baby! Suck my cock or I'll shove it into your belly." 

'Holy crap! The damn thing is huge. If I don't suck the goddamn prick, he'll probably screw me. Crap, hopefully the bastard will be satisfied with a blowjob.' She stared at the throbbing pecker and then realized she was in a very defenseless position. 'Christ, the bastard has his fucking face in my crack. Oh gawd, I've always wondered about 69... what it was like? Dear gawd, not with this guy.' 

Jane hesitated before moving one hand to the pulsating cock. She flinched when her fingers touched the scorching meat and the scene was right out of a porno flick. The gorgeous woman slowly puts the head of the man's cock in her mouth and the man licks the unprotected pussy slit. Then the woman's body jerks and shudders, but she can't escape the man's tongue, as her hips are held steady by his strong hands. 

The scene grew more erotic and dramatic in a hurry. Jane's sudden solution was to finish the young man off, as fast as she could. She wrapped the fingers of both hands around the upraised cock, holding it up with her left hand and stroking it furiously with her right. 'Oh gawd, how long has it been since I sucked cock? Gawd, now I'm sucking a stranger's cock! What have I become?' Her mouth was full, but her brain worked overtime, as she tried to find the end of Brad's stamina. 

The cunnilingus was skillful and far more animalistic than Jane expected. Brad held her straddling his face and used his tongue to lash through her long narrow, pink slit. He made sure to caress the pink clitty, as well as stab the two holes each time he stroked the enticing womanhood. Jane tried her best to ignore Brad and she concentrated on the job in hand, so she didn't feel threatened. Although her stomach heaved each time the young man slapped her clitoris with his tongue, she managed to somewhat control the flow of juices out of her feminine being. 

The first blast of thick cream surprised her. One second she was sucking and stroking the young man's impressive cock, trying to end the blowjob; the next she was coughing in a most desperate fashion and forced to swallow, or else choke to death. Jane did something she swore never to do. The cum hit the back of her throat and she swallowed the white cream without thinking. The thick cock throbbed crazily and the orgasm seemed to last for the longest time. 

*** 

Customarily it was wham, bam, and thank you ma'am when she had sex with her husband, but that was not the case with this virile young man. Jane prayed that Brad didn't have an insatiable lusting for sex. She wished he was like most men and would be satisfied with a good blowjob and maybe a good handjob. 

Somehow when the blowjob and cunnilingus finished, Brad succeeded in getting her in his arms. Jane laid on her right side facing the young man and there was one extremely obvious aspect about his stature. He still sported an erection and Brad deliberately placed it to cause her the most distress. "Brad, please don't touch me down there... with your pe..." 

"Don't worry. I have a condom. I'll put it on." 

Jane heard the young man and she was amazed that he still had a hard-on. "You aren't planning..." 

"Sweetheart! I've dreamed of nothing else," he whispered. "I can't wait to get my cock into the most desirable woman in the whole city." 

"Oh gawd, you can't!" 

"But sweetheart, you know that I won't quit until I've tasted all of your delicious riches... everything you possess, including your most precious charm." 

Jane thought she would lose her mind when Brad rolled onto his back and donned a bright red condom. 'Dear gawd, why did I come here tonight?' She had never seen one so fancy or one that had creatively shaped material around the tip. A threatening shiver shot through her body when she realized the ominous condom was made for a woman's pleasure, but she vowed not to experience any. 

Brad easily assumed a missionary position. His much larger body pinned her on her back and he stared directly at her. Jane turned her head, refusing to look at the blackmailer, and she attempted a valiant protest. "Please, Brad we can't do this. Haven't we done enough already?" 

"You wanted me to keep quiet... not to tell everyone about your storeroom indiscretions. Well I promised to keep quiet, but you'll have to do one more thing," Brad whispered. "I watched you masturbate; that was the most fantastic orgasm I've ever seen. I watched you climax during that wonderful cunnilingus; now I want to watch your pretty face when I fill your belly with cum." 

'Like I have a choice? Go ahead, asshole, screw me with that pathetic penis. I'll never look at you again once this fucking ordeal is over.' It was a silent promise, which made her feel a lot better for succumbing to the young man's, blackmail demands. She didn't feel too threatened because the young man willingly agreed to wear a condom, which was a great relief. 

Brad put her chin between his thumb and forefinger and turned her head. He glared into her teary eyes, as the weight of his lower body pried her legs apart. Jane felt the end of his pecker poking and trying to hit the correct spot, which made her cringe with fright. Then he shifted his hips so that his penis rested directly on top of her shivering pelvis. "Stroke it baby. I can stay hard all night, but you can make it harder," Brad whispered. "Stroke me, babe." 

"Oh, Brad, please no more," she pleaded, as she glared back at him. His stare was unyielding and reluctantly she slipped her arm between their bodies. Her hand flinched when her fingers touched the throbbing penis and like earlier, his heartbeat radiated up her arm. 

Brad arched his back and thrust his hips back and forth and used her dainty hand, as a caressing tool. "That feels nice. You know how to make a man yearn for sex," he said. "I get hard every time I think of you... your sexy body." 

"Nnnuuu, Nnuu." She felt the cock get harder and to her amazement, grow larger. 

Abruptly Brad jerked backwards and pulled his cock out of her hand. Then he slowly pushed his hips deeper into her thighs until his cock hit the mark. Jane held her breath when the thick head spread her puffy lips and she knew what was next. 

It may have been the ride of his life for Brad, but not for Jane. What she felt was some pain and more than anything else some agony from being used. The one thing very evident at first for Brad was that it was very difficult to enter his adorable teacher. Not only did the condom hinder penetration, it took awhile to stretch the opening. When Brad reached virgin territory, he received the ultimate joy and the ecstasy was extraordinary. The head of his cock hit a wall and it took many thrusts and careful pushing before he was able to fully embed his cock. 

Once his cock was buried to the hilt, Brad felt the most intense heat of his life. He realized his stamina wasn't limitless when his stomach started heaving like mad and knew there wasn't much time to enjoy the wondrous feeling. The base of his cock twitched a few times and then small jets of precum filled the end of the rubber sheath. 

Jane would forever be sorry for following her natural tendencies. Her arms went around the young man's shoulders and she used a motherly embrace to guide him through what was expected to be a long, tremulous tunnel. Once she realized her mistake, she tried not to encourage or make it better for Brad. It actually took her breath away when he pumped in and out a few times and she anticipated a quick ending to the sinful episode. 

Jane assumed the disparaging affair was almost over. She felt ashamed and totally used by the young man who was using her body for his self- gratification. All of a sudden Brad's body straightened out, as he lay on top of her beleaguered torso, and then he rolled over onto his back. He grabbed her tightly and rolled her over at the same time so that she wound up on top. "You're almost done... only one more thing. I have one fantasy left," Brad whispered, staring right at her. "Just a little break or I'll blow my top; then one last fantasy." 

"This is the last. Then it's over," she pleaded. "You promised." 

Brad pulled her upwards until his throbbing cock slipped out of her inferno. "I need a second... a break," he said. "I want this to last a long time." The respite was precisely what Brad needed. He twisted his shoulders and reached his right arm down far enough to go around her thigh. Brad pulled her left leg upwards, which put Jane in an awkward position, but it enabled him to reach behind her and between her legs. He grabbed his cock and held it in the air before laying it against her vulnerable pussy. 

Jane was eager to end the affair and that willingness was her downfall. She felt him squirming and struggling and assumed he was preparing to insert his ramrod again. She felt him enter her wetness and her entire body shuddered when the head easily slipped into her honey-hole this time. 

Jane's eagerness enabled the devious Brad to fulfill his last fantasy. He pushed her shoulders upwards off his chest, so that her back arched, and then he looked into her eyes. "I want the greatest orgasm. One with you sitting on top of me and riding my cock," he said. "You're going to be my cowgirl." 

If she had any idea of his real intentions, Jane would have screamed her head off. Instead, she naively put up a measly protest. "Brad, I've done everything... all that you've asked." 

"Yeah, I know. I love you for that." 

"I don't think I can do anything more." 

"Oh, you can... and will. Like I said, one more thing and you can go." 

"You promised before." 

"Well you're such a desirable woman and your beauty makes me crazy. This time, I promise you can leave." Brad pushed her shoulders harder, arching her back severely, and he forced her to bring her knees up so that she was in a kneeling position. She straddled his hips and this time his cock went in so fast and easy that Jane thought it was well lubricated. She was amazed and simply assumed it was her body adapting to the awful intrusion. 

Brad quickly let go of her shoulders and put his hands around her waist. He jerked her down and felt the elation of reaching Jane's deepest being. His eyes bugged out when he stared at the luscious chest hovering inches above him. "Ride me baby. Keep my cock in your belly and have the ride of your life," Brad moaned. "Christ my balls ache... I want it so bad." 

Jane thought he was crazy and she tried to end it quickly. She sort of bounced up and down on the young man's hips, as his body went out of control. Her hands went to his chest in an effort to keep her balance and she gave the young man a most spectacular vision. Her biceps pressed against the sides of her boobs and made them appear even bigger, as they swayed enticingly up and down. She prepared herself for the worst, but there was nothing that could prepare her for the drastic calamity. 

Jane threw her head back and pretended to be a real cowgirl, which was intended to rob the young man's stamina. There were familiar twitching and jerking in her deepest regions and Jane knew Brad was likely filling the condom with his filthy cum. She would always remember glancing off to one side and into a sublime setting of blank space. Her head sort of rolled back and forth and suddenly she noticed something very disturbing. "Dear gawd, Brad! Oh, Brad, it can't be. Please, it can't be." 

Brad's tummy heaved in and out, as he emptied his cum-load. He noticed Jane staring at the long, red rubber that he discarded when he rolled over. "The best in the world. A cowgirl riding bareback." 

"But... but... but?" 

"I had to feel the real thing. All of the intimacy of the sexiest woman." 

"But, when... you know what could happen?" 

"I ripped the fucking thing off and you rode bareback. Christ I thought my balls were going to burst." 

"Oh gawd, no!" 

"You're the absolute best... the best piece of ass." 

"Dear gawd, Brad. I could get pregnant." 

"So what! It's about time hubby realized he's married to the horniest woman who deserves the best." 

Jane used every bit of strength to get up. She jumped off the bed and felt the uncomfortable wetness between her legs. Tears welled in her eyes and soon they trickled down her flushed cheeks. "How could you?" Strangely her mind quickly went over the timeline and thankfully it was only three or four days since her period. 

Jane cried. She certainly shouldn't be in the vulnerable stage for a few days, which made her somewhat relieved, but she was distraught for being treated like a common whore by the young man. Sadly it was only the beginning and there was no time to feel sorry for herself. A defining moment in her life happened within the blink of an eye when the front door of the apartment slammed. Jane's heart stopped beating and she realized Josh had come home. 

She was aware of the young man leaving school early that day to visit his parents and it was an unsuspected surprise when he showed up at the apartment. Brad noticed her questing expression. "Good, Josh is home! I've waited for weeks to flaunt this in his face," he whispered. "We had a bet!" 

Jane hastily searched for her clothes and at the same time tried to comprehend what Brad was telling her. "Huuugh. What?" 

"Yeah, your star trainee and I had a bet... to see who was the first to have sex with the sexually frustrated, married teacher." 

She felt like a used piece of meat. Brad practically pushed her aside and he was more concerned with cleaning up before meeting his best buddy. He swiftly donned a pair of pants and went out to meet Josh while Jane slithered out of sight so she couldn't be seen from the other room. She didn't leave the bedroom. Although Jane hated being in Brad's dungeon, the thought of facing Josh was far too petrifying. Her guilt was overwhelming and she felt sick at being caught. 

Jane eavesdropped on the conversation coming from the living room and imagined the worst, as she finished getting dressed. "I won, man. I won the bet." She shuddered when Brad bragged that he had just accomplished the impossible. 

"It was off. I told you to leave her alone... that the bet was off." 

"I did it, man. I told you I'd get into her pants," Brad boasted. "I screwed her and she loved every bit of it." 

"Asshole, I fucking told you to stop... to leave her alone." 

Jane couldn't believe her ears. She had been the prize for a bet between two immature young men. The tears rolled down her cheeks and she barely managed to stop herself from balling her eyes out. Nothing else registered in her distraught mind until all hell broke loose in the living room. "GET OUT! GET OUT!" Josh's voice was loud and very authoritarian. 

Brad who surely knew his friend was thoroughly pissed off heeded the warning without any delay. He hurried into the bedroom to finish dressing and noticed the shivering, frightened woman standing across the room. The walls closed in on her and Jane had to get out of the small bedroom. She rushed out and ran straight into Josh who was waiting in the living room. 

"C'mon! I'll drive you home," Josh whispered. "Let's get out of her before I kill someone." 

Jane almost blurted out that she didn't need a ride, but abruptly realized that she was in no condition to drive. There was no harm in accepting Josh's offer since her husband was away so she followed him outside. Josh drove and she sat stoic against the passenger door, as if trying to keep her distance from a stranger. The car was eerily quiet and it was obvious both were trying to think of the right thing to say. 

Jane's remorse and shame quickly turned to raging anger. "How could you?" 

"I'm sorry... so sorry. Sorrier than you can ever imagine." 

"I trusted you... trusted you more than anyone." 

"It's not what you think... honestly." 

"Oh, really! I wasn't a prize... a prized whore?" 

"You have to trust me. I didn't want this to happen." 

"What? No, you wanted to win the bet?" 

"No! Brad is conniving and very sneaky. When we first met you, we both thought you were the most attractive, desirable woman. Then during a drunken party we made a stupid bet, which started out as just a silly wager between two drunks," Josh said. "Once I got to know you, I called it all off." 

"Oh, really?" 

"Honest, I didn't want this to happen." 

"How did Brad know all about the storeroom? That's what he used to blackmail me." 

"The dirty bastard spiked my drinks the other night and I got falling-down drunk. Anyway, I'm a blabbermouth once I'm plastered," Josh said. "He assumed a lot and probably fooled you into thinking he knew everything. That's why his sneaky plan worked." 

"I feel sick. I cheated... oh gawd, I cheated," she moaned. "He blackmailed me into becoming a slut... a cheap slut." 

"I tried to stop him. I'm sorry things went this far." 

They neared her home and Jane was feeling a little better. "Thanks for driving me home. I don't think I am in any shape to drive." 

"I know. It was my fault and I'll do anything... anything in the world to make the nightmare disappear."  

===

Jane had to be alone. When Josh pulled into the driveway, the guilt quickly became suffocating. She knew not to make any excuses, yet she did anyway. "Best I go in right away... I need to be alone. Thanks again and I'll see you at school." 

Josh faced her and looked into her eyes, which were still teary. "I realized that you were special the first time I saw you in class," he whispered. "That's when I fell in love with you." 

"Dear Gawd, Josh, you can't," she stammered. "Don't say that." 

"Love at first sight! I've known it for some time and now it's out." 

Josh turned slightly sideways in the seat and held his arms in an open invitation. Jane stared at the young man with the strongest urge to fall into his arms, but the shame and guilt were too strong. She sobbed with overwhelming doubt and quickly exited the car for the safety of home. 

*** 

The entire night was nothing like she imaged. She stumbled into the house and went straight up to her bedroom. It took her a few moments to regain her composure before she had the strength to undress for bed. She caught a glimpse of her naked body just before donning her usual nightie and noticed a few red marks and some minor scratches. Goosebumps formed on her arms when she imagined what happened and that for the first time in her life, she was unfaithful. 

Jane wasn't too worried about what to tell her husband, as he wouldn't be home until Sunday. They didn't talk much these days about very personal or intimate things so at least she wouldn't have to lie to him. The real troubling thing was trying to justify her decadent actions to herself. She never dreamed that one day she would commit adultery and jeopardize her family's security. 

Every muscle in her body hurt and her mind was totally exhausted from trying to outwit the devil. Not only had she lost the physical battle, she had also lost the mind games. Brad had enticed her to masturbate with them both watching it all in the mirror. Then in hopes of ending the affair, she had given the young man the most fantastic blowjob, praying it would satisfy his lust. Much to her horror, Brad simply blew his load down her throat before he performed the glorious cunnilingus. Jane prayed for another early salvation, but again she was outwitted, as she allowed the sexual desires to blossom until she creamed like a wanton slut. 

Then the absolute worst part of the night happened. Brad forced her to sit on top of his stellar cock and ride him like a cowgirl. She did it assuming that once his blackmail demands were satisfied she would be set free. To her utter dismay Brad had ripped off the condom and filled her with his virile seed, most likely hoping to get her pregnant. Jane bounced up and down in the saddle and she was astonished at the young man's endurance, which she attributed to his earlier climax. 

The rest of the weekend was mentally exhausting, as Jane couldn't get Friday night out of her mind. She definitely didn't get much sleep; then on Sunday her life was back to normal. Showing up at school on Monday morning was the hardest thing Jane had ever done. She knew Brad and Josh would be there and wondered if she was strong enough to face them again. Much to her dismay, the first meeting with Brad was uneventful and it was over in no time. 

Then the strangest thing happened. The principal prided himself in assuring that the teachers in his school were adequately up-to-date in the newest techniques. An innovative one-day seminar was offered at the local university and he surprised Jane with an offer to attend. "Don't worry about your classes. I'll get a sub to fill-in and all you need to do is select which day you want to attend. It runs each day next week and, oh yeah, I'll send one of the trainees with four of my regular teachers." 

Immediately Jane felt overwhelmed. She didn't mind the seminar and liked the idea of enhancing her teaching skills, but the idea of going with someone was unpleasant. The principal noticed her hesitation. "You seem to get along better with Josh and Brad than any of the others... so it's probably best if you go with one of them," he said. "Just let me know which one and I'll arrange it." 

Jane was dumbfounded. 'OMG,' she thought. 'Now I'm being setup with a young guy who wants to screw me. In fact, one who has screwed me in more ways than one... and another guy who will do anything to have sex with me.' 

She looked at her principal, as he waited for an answer. "Aaah, I would rather go with one of the girls, if that's possible?" 

"Jane, you're great with the young trainees and you seem to have a better rapport with the young men. I just can't see any of the others going with Josh or Brad; well, maybe Ken might get along with both of them, but I would rather you go with one of them. Both have given you a big vote of confidence and say you're the best tutor in the school." 

"Oh, geez, I'm not sure." 

"I'll tell you what! I'll leave it up to them. They can decide which one is going with my favorite lady." 

Jane left the office and her heart pounded frantically in her chest. She did everything humanly possible to stay away from the two young men and luckily the schedule didn't have either man in her classroom. By the end of the week, the blackmail episode wasn't as fresh in her head and she welcomed the weekend. When she departed school after her last class on Friday, the principal delivered the shocking news. He told her that Josh was picking her up at home on Monday morning and taking her to the seminar. 

It was the second weekend in a row that she fretted about what was happening in her life. One minute she was thoroughly pleased with her job and the next she was pessimistic at going to school because Brad and Josh were there. By Monday morning, Jane had made many decisions, which gave her peace of mind knowing she was taking a definite path in life. 

*** 

The seminar was actually very enlightening and enjoyable. Although Josh sat beside her, he never put any bold moves on her so she was very relieved. It wasn't until almost the lunch break that the young man said anything intimate to her. "I feel like I'm back in high school, sitting beside my sweetheart, and waiting to go for a noon hour quickie." 

Jane glanced at the young man and she was taken by his warm, seductive smile. "Hummm, you watch yourself young man, or Mrs. Smithers will have to scold you." 

"I'll be waiting." 

She looked into his dark mesmerizing eyes and wondered at how easily she had forgiven the young man. "I'll bet you will." 

The session ended abruptly and everyone started leaving the large theater. Josh innocently took her by the elbow and it seemed the most natural thing to let the young man lead the way. "I have a little something prepared at my place. Oh, did I tell you? I live alone now." 

Jane didn't bother asking why; she merely followed Josh's lead out to his car. She had the strangest feeling that it might change her life forever, yet she willingly went with the young man. The drive was only ten minutes so they didn't have much time to chitchat before they got to his apartment. Again Josh was the gracious host and Jane followed him, actually welcoming the opportunity to renew their once flourishing friendship. 

The door closed behind her and she opened her mouth to say something nice. All of a sudden Josh leaned into her and kissed her on the lips. Her body pressed against his and instantly Jane felt incredible, as a severe shiver shot up her spine. Something long and hard pushed into her stomach and she was well aware that the young man was already very aroused. 

They were both huffing like mad when the kiss broke. "We can't; we have to be back at the seminar in an hour." 

"I know. That's why they call this a quickie." 

Jane felt like she was back in junior high and that pleasures and joys were too much to resist. She felt her blouse being unbuttoned and within seconds being rolled off her shoulders, as she tried assisting the striptease. Then to her utter amazement, she watched when Josh quickly stripped and stood in front of her. Jane barely realized that she did the same thing, as she tossed her expensive clothes away like rags. 

"I see you did it. Shaved for me?" 

"Ye... yes. I did." 

Suddenly Josh grabbed her shoulders and turned her around. He pushed her until she was up against the wall and she turned her head to protect her face. Her head was sideways with her cheek on the wall and Josh put his controlling hand in the middle of her back, holding her against the wall. Josh leaned into her shivering torso and put his face beside the back of her head. He kissed the back of her neck and then put his lips on her burning ear. 

Jane couldn't remember getting hot so fast. The time ticked by and she was well aware that they had to leave shortly, which seemed to heighten the anticipation of what Josh might do to her. All of a sudden she felt the hot length of steel pressing into her bare ass-cheeks. When the young man shifted his hips around, she openly did the same thing so that his rod pressed into the well-defined, narrow crack. 

Her arms were outstretched and slightly above her head, as they were magically pinned on the wall. She tried hard to breathe properly, but it was difficult because her emotions were sky-high. Jane wondered at her sudden brazen actions and questioned if she was losing her mind. 

Josh put his foot against hers and spread her legs. "Wonderful. Did you touch yourself when you shaved... feel yourself after?" 

Jane was too stunned to respond at first, but the young man jabbed her. She felt Josh dip down until his ramrod dropped below her butt; then he straightened his legs, forcing her up onto her tiptoes. "Yea... yes!" Lying seemed like the perfect solution, but her religious upbringing was too strong. "Dear gawd, yes, yes I did touch myself. Oh no, don't touch me there." 

"Good. Did you finger yourself... masturbate." 

Jane was too ashamed, but again couldn't lie. She lost her voice and simply nodded her head so that he would know. She balanced on her toes and felt the tip of Josh's dagger against her soul. Her body was on fire and the intense flames seemed to rob her sanity. "We can't... dear gawd, we have to stop. I'm not on anything and we have to stop." 

"Of course, we will," he responded. Josh jiggled his hips and knew exactly when he hit the mark. Jane's mouth popped open wide and her breathing became utterly ragged and uneven. Then her body started shaking and he was scared that she was not going to wait. "Not yet. Please, not yet." 

Jane didn't know what was wrong with her. The fiery emotions scorched what was once a faithful, moral woman and turned her into a sinner. "We have to stop. I can't... can't go all the way," she moaned. "We need protection." 

Josh moved his right hand to the back of her head and wrapped his fingers into the long, curly strands of hair. He jerked her head backwards, arching her neck severely so that he could see her teary eyes. "I want you so badly!" Then he thrust his hips upwards and her feet came off the floor. "I love you. I've wanted you from the first time we met!" 

He sliced through the puffy lips and entered her precious domain in a heartbeat. She desperately gasped for air, but nothing helped. Then a fly on the wall witnessed the lust of two lost lovers. Josh let go of her hair and her cheek fell against the flat wall. Her head remained perfectly positioned so she could see the black man behind her, out of the corner of her eye. Josh grabbed her hips and pulled them backwards so that her back arched, but her chest remained firmly planted on the wall. 

Jane realized that she was in the most vulnerable position, yet she never moved. All of a sudden the young man was balls-deep and her feet were off the floor. It happened so quickly that neither was ready for the early orgasm. Jane's guts erupted and for the second time in her life she cried during a climax. Her cheek got wet with tears and then her face slipped up and down on the slippery wall. She heard Josh pleading for her to hold on... to wait for a few more seconds, but it was too late. 

Sex was always a rushed mania with her husband. On the rare times she did achieve a climax, it was usually the result of great internal willpower, lots of foreplay and the fact her fingers were extremely skilled at self- gratification. Jane couldn't remember the last time an orgasm occurred without any clitoris stimulation, but here she was creaming as if she was a schoolgirl slut. Suddenly she was totally helpless. Her body belonged to a spirit and there was no stopping the violent spasms. 

Powerful convulsions rocked her body and the orgasm seemed to roll through an endless wilderness. Just when Jane thought it was over, Josh gave the most dominant thrust, which lifted her higher in the air. Jane felt the thick cock swell and start to squirt wildly inside her heated cavity. Some of her tears were possibly the result of knowing what might happen without birth control, but the immense joy far outweighed any dire consequences. 

The room was sweltering hot, which resulted in both being covered with sweat. Jane appeared to hang in the air, pressed against the wall with her legs crudely splayed out to the sides. She had just willingly done something that hours, or days ago would have seemed impossible; yet she wasn't sorry. 

Shortly after the last spasm tore through his loins, Josh was hit with a harsh realism. The lunch break was almost over and they had very little time. They dressed, as fast as possible, and ran out of the apartment in record time, getting back to the seminar just when the next speaker took the stage. 

Jane was not accustomed to being in such a soiled or untidy condition while in public. She felt clammy and even had sweat in her armpits, which should have made her very uncomfortable. Instead, she glanced at the young man seated to the right and her heart fluttered, as if she was a little girl again. Then the supposed horrible thought that she might get pregnant entered her mind, but it merely heightened her awakened state. Unlike last time with Brad, this time she was totally in danger because she was in the middle of her most vulnerable period. 

*** 

Following the seminar, it seemed Jane got closer to Josh. She would never admit it, but they seemed to get more intimate with each passing day. They spent every noon hour together and both were extremely comfortable around each other, which she hoped wasn't noticed by her fellow teachers. With the fall semester coming to an end, Josh and the other three interns would return to university for classes to finish their education. As was customary in the school, all of the regular teachers took the four out for a final celebration dinner at a nice restaurant. 

Jane also did something that she had never done before. She lied to her husband about going out on a Friday night. Half of what she said was true. It was a celebration to say goodbye to the four trainees, but she was not going specifically to be with her girlfriends. Jane's stomach was full of butterflies when she thought about a specific young man and her heart raced at the possibility of spending time with Josh in a party environment. 

These parties usually didn't last too late and this one wasn't any different. Most of the regular teachers departed about nine, leaving only a couple stragglers with Jane besides the four trainees. It wasn't long before Brad and the two young female trainees left the party, inviting the rest to join them on a bar hoping experience. Everyone declined and soon the only two remaining were Josh and Jane who admitted having too many glasses of wine. 

Jane was never one to handle her booze that good and she felt fairly tipsy even though the hour was still early. When Josh offered her one more drink, she kidded that a married woman shouldn't be sitting around drinking with a strange man. "Are you trying to get me drunk young man?" Jane stared at Josh and her heart fluttered when she noticed his knowing, seductive smile. 

Josh leaned across the table until he was mere inches away from her. "Yes! I am going to feed you alcohol and then take you out to my car where I'm going to kiss you all over," he whispered. "Then I'm going to drive you to my place." 

Jane blinked at the young man's bold predictions, but her heart continued to pound. "But whatever would we do at your place? You wouldn't take advantage of a woman who has had too much to drink, would you?" 

"I wouldn't do anything the woman didn't want." 

"That's what I am afraid of," she whispered, feeling her tummy shudder with anticipation. "What if the woman didn't ask you to... to touch her?" 

"I would look the lady in the eye and beg her," Josh whispered. "Beg for her hand and for her beautiful, sexy body." 

"Huuummm, I think we should go since we are the only ones left," she said. Josh's compliments were flattering, as no one called her sexy these days, and certainly not her husband who seemed too disinterested. 

Jane decided to leave her car and catch a ride with Josh who wisely planned for such an occurrence. He consumed very little and remained sober, which enabled him to drive. They walked out to the parking lot hand-in-hand and Jane wasn't sure why she seemed a little giddy and bewildered. Josh walked her to the passenger door and turned her around so they faced each other. Jane sort of looked up at him and didn't move away when he slowly bent over to kiss her. 

The area was dark and no one noticed the two shadowy figures standing next to the car. Jane was breathless in no time and luckily the kiss broke before she collapsed. She let Josh open the door for her and got into the car knowing what to expect once they got to his apartment. The ride was quiet and neither said much, as nothing seemed appropriate for such an expectant, intimate moment. 

When Josh escorted her into the apartment, he immediately pushed her up against the wall. The resulting kiss was feverish and it seemed a continuation from the one in the parking lot. Josh moved to rain kisses all over her flushed face, down her neck and onto her shoulders. He pulled her clothing out of the way and managed to taste the rich delights of her upper chest and bare shoulders, before returning to her lips. 

Without warning her feet were moving and she quickly found herself in Josh's bedroom. There were arms and hands all over the place, as the action was fast and furious. The art of undressing seemed too painstaking and the struggle was to strip without breaking the prolonged kiss. In no time she was naked and standing on her tiptoes, trying to display her intense passion for the man of her dreams. 

When the back of legs hit the side of the bed, she tumbled backwards. Josh's dexterity prevented a big fall and he gently let her hit the bed before landing on top of her. Jane's temperature was at a feverish level and not much mattered to her other than the young man in her arms. She felt him pull away and reach to the side. "It's okay. You don't need that," she whispered. 

Josh straightened and arched his back so he could look into her eyes. At that exact moment, Jane felt her labia being cut in two. She stopped breathing when her vagina spread and slowly surrounded the long thick, black penis. Jane vowed not to take another breath until Josh was fully embedded and she felt like a little girl again. A girl so happy and content that she didn't want to wait. At first her hips jerked randomly, as she desperately thrust up at the young man. 

Josh felt the intense heat consume his moral fiber. He too pumped his hips in a very random fashion and there was no magical rhythm. Each person seemed to think speed was of the utmost essence for satisfying the other's desire, as their hips thrust madly at each other. They experienced wild sexual lust at 11 o'clock; they made mad, passionate love at 12 o'clock and experienced animal ecstasy at 1 o'clock.  

===

Even though it was late, Jane hesitated going home. It was definitely late, but the lovemaking was too profound for any rational thinking. It was Josh who came to his senses after the third earth-shattering climax. "I will take you home. I wish we could stay like this all night, but we can't." 

"Yes, you're right. I don't usually stay out his late," she whispered. "My husband will think I've had too much to drink." 

"I'll always cherish what happened tonight." 

Jane was virtually speechless, as her heart seemed to block her throat. "Huuummm, yes. You don't know what it means to me... everything." 

*** 

Jane stood at the front of the class when she got hit with a sudden urge to upchuck. She immediately excused herself and rushed to the washroom where she threw up. Her illness was over in no time and she returned to class, thinking nothing of the tiny event. It wasn't until she got home and was sitting down for dinner that the reality hit her. She had suspicions since missing her period was unusual, but shrugged them off, thinking that it just wasn't probable that one or two mistakes could prove disastrous. 

About a week later, Jane went in for a checkup because she was sick on a daily basis, plus the missed period was a definite indicator that something might be wrong. When the doctor looked at her after doing all of the tests, he had the biggest smile on his face. Instantly her heart beat faster and she knew what to expect. "Well young lady, you've finally done it. You're going to be a mother." 

Luckily Jane was sitting down because her legs felt like rubber. She barely answered, as the news was too shocking even after suspecting something might be amiss. "I wondered... but didn't want to get my hopes up." 

"You're in great shape and perfectly healthy. Everything should be good and I'm sure your husband will be overjoyed with the news." 

Jane's heart pounded and she was positive her face looked guilty. "Yea... yes, I can hardly wait to tell him." Jane glanced down at her feet, too ashamed to look at her doctor. "He'll be surprised." 

"Make sure you have my receptionist arrange all of the checkups from now till the big day. I would guess that you are about five or six weeks. Being that this is your first, we want to make sure everything goes perfectly." 

Jane was in a complete daze when she left the doctor's office and stopped at the front desk. She agreed with all of the upcoming appointments and departed still in a highly excited state of mind. It probably wasn't wise to drive, but Jane was careful and managed to get home without an accident. She welcomed the quiet solitude, as her husband wouldn't be home for at least another hour. She had time to dwell on what to do, which was both extremely daunting and highly exhilarating. 

Jane seriously thought over the timeline for the past two months. Having sex with three men was something unimaginable and she tried to put everything in the proper sequence. Her meeting with Brad was just a short time after her last period and it was a day after she had sex with her husband who always used a condom. Then a week later she attended the seminar with Josh and the unthinkable happened. She not only had sex with the young man, but she never even insisted that he use any protection. Acting like a teenager again still sent shivers through her entire body, as she remembered the raunchy yet intimate intercourse. 

Making the most important decision of her life was utterly traumatizing, yet Jane was shocked that it was possible to reach a drastic solution within minutes. She had most likely known, which path to take, because she merely went through the motions of being happily married during the past two years. Her husband had his business, which he loved. He devoted most of his time to reaching the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and she was beyond material things. 

Jane had what she cherished most and something she dreamed about since grade school. She was expecting the most precious gift, which would always be God's gift. Jane suspected who made her pregnant and prayed she was right. Not that it made a difference because she was no longer willing to wait. She had grown distant from her husband and the decision for divorce gave her peace of mind. Jane's only worries now were for her baby and a possible union with the father.
