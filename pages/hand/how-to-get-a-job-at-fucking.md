****************** 

(Tori) 

I honestly couldn't stand him. 

His name was Paul Martin. And apparently, according to everyone else I worked with he was this perfect fucking guy. Judging by the stories, when he would walk across the office, light would shine on him and the angels would sing. Everyone fawned over him. The other girls in the office talked about how cute they found him and how lucky his wife was. The guys would say how cool he was and talk about how they had hung out with him that one time. He was treated like a rock star within the office. No, actually it was more like, they treated him like a rock star, crossed with the pope, who was also an Olympic hero. 

And of course he was, without a doubt, the most aggressively nice guy around. He was annoyingly nice. He would chat people up, and he knew every little thing about every single person. He would talk to the other salesmen and the bosses one minute, and the secretaries and the janitors the next. He would even talk to those old-timers who had been working the same fucking job for years. He would schmooze them up in a way that would seem totally false from most others, but not him. I think he actually cared about these people, which is just nuts to me. He was either the most incredibly friendly guy around or an incredible conman. But as time went on he never slipped. His perfect veneer never wavered, even after working here for years. It seemed like he was actually as perfect as everyone thought he was. 

He was the top salesman at the company. His rise within the company was unprecedented, but his high intelligence, humor, and charisma made him an absolute natural. Even I could admit that. He was very good at his job. The big bosses loved him and he almost became the poster-boy for the company. He was the guy the company sent out for PR events, the young, handsome face of the company. His face was probably on a company billboard somewhere. I'd definitely seen him on the website. He would be the guy they would trot out to donate checks to charities, volunteering at the church and the local soup kitchen. The bosses knew what they had in him, and they threw everything his way. Promotions, money... the CEO even gave him permission to date his daughter. Now, he held one of the highest positions in the company, he served many different roles within the company, and he was married to the CEO's little princess. Not bad for 30-year old. He was a lifer here for sure, and judging by how his life was going, the rest of it was gonna no doubt be very good. At 30 he was already set, and it seemed like he barely had to try. His future was very bright. 

God, it was so annoying! 

He was just one of those guys that had everything just come to him, you know? If he bought one lottery ticket, he would win. If he went to a baseball game, he would catch the foul ball. If he dug a hole in his backyard, he would strike oil. Everything just went his fucking way. It was infuriating how easy he had it. 

I hated him with a passion. He was just... he was just too good, you know? He was too perfect. It just HAD to be bullshit. No one was that nice. No one cared that much about other people. I would see him at work, and it was SO obvious to me what he was doing. A conman couldn't do it better. He was such a good schmoozer and it was just so natural for him. He did it with everyone and they loved him for it. People bent over backwards to be in his presence to have his attention. To his credit, he was great at one-on-one interaction. When he talked to you, it felt like he was your best friend, like your problems were the only thing on his mind. He came across as totally genuine and truly caring. It was infuriating! I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes when he flashed those pearly whites and gave that charming laugh of his. 

I couldn't let anyone else see how much Paul frustrated me. How irritating I found him. It was impossible for anyone to hate the immaculate Paul Martin, apparently. And even voicing the slightest bit of that annoyance would be enough to make me the talk of the office. Not that I already wasn't, but that's a whole other part of the story. 

I can't tell you how many times I had to look up and watch him chatting with the execs, seeing them slapping him on the back like a son. I grit my teeth every time he made some old lady giggle, or some young woman blush. I gave him my death glare when I heard him effortlessly transition from talking intelligently about world events with one group of people to chatting up fantasy football with another. 

Plus, because he had to just have everything going for him, he was also very good looking, of course. The girls in the office always talked about his cute smile and his square jaw, the dimples, and that perfectly unkempt hair. The less inhibited girls talked openly about his impressive fit body and cute butt. He was this fucking perfect, All-American golden boy. Good looking, with the perfect life, a pretty wife, a perfect house, and a perfect body. He would be the guy in the fucking pictures when you bought a fucking picture frame. He would be the love interest in some shitty rom-com. He was just so boringly fucking perfect. 

If it wasn't clear already, I just couldn't stand him. 

But, God, did I ever want to fuck him. 

I know, I know... I couldn't explain it. He was SO not my type. I preferred the type of guy I would find at the club, a guy who could knock back a few drinks. A guy who would look at me and give me THAT look, that 'I want to fuck you right now' look. A guy who would buy me drinks, chat me up, and drill my hot ass at the first opportunity. I knew I had terrible taste in guys, but those obvious flirts, those lecherous party guys who just obviously wanted a piece of my hot body... those guys were just way more fun. Guys like Paul were boring to me... normally. 

I couldn't explain it. He was so clean-cut, and boyish, and seemingly innocent, a good, friendly, nice guy. Ugh... boring, right? But when I would see him, being the fucking perfect guy, all I could think about was that he had to have a dark side. He HAD to. He couldn't actually be perfect. He had to have some sort of character flaw. Maybe he was a freak in the bedroom, but I couldn't even imagine him fucking. He no doubt made sweet, nice love to his pretty wife on a bed of flowers in the sunshine, while birds sang. I couldn't imagine that mouth of his in a snarl, fucking some slut hard. I couldn't imagine his muscles taut with need. I couldn't imagine his cute butt flexing. I couldn't imagine hearing him growl in my ear, voice heavy with lust. I couldn't imagine his big, manly hands on my large breasts, squeezing them, taking them like a man. I would squeeze his butt hard as he fucked me, screaming at him to take me like a slut, bite my nipples, squeeze my huge fucking tits, and take me like the stud he was. God, I would let him do it all to me. I would let him try to make a good woman out of me. 

Yeah, that's how it kinda started... 

Despite my best efforts, for some reason, he would keep popping up in my dreams. My fantasies. At some point, the wires in my brain got crossed, and suddenly a guy like him became the object of my lust. He was hot, okay! I admit it! He was a former athlete, and he still had the body for it. As annoying as I found him, I couldn't look at him without my thoughts devolving into thoughts of sex. Thoughts of sex with him. Thoughts of all the bad things I could teach a good boy like him. Whispers of his butt and his noticeable bulge were commonplace in the office, and even I wasn't immune. 

I hated myself for it. I hated myself for wanting him. I hated that a boring ole nice guy could get my juices stirring. He was the type of guy my mom would approve of. UGH! I hated that I, just like all the rest, was susceptible to his charms. I should know better. I could see through him, but it didn't make a God damn difference. I hated the guy, but I wanted the dick. Oh, did I ever want that fat married cock of his. I would inhale the shaft, cradle the balls, and swallow the load. I would blow his fucking mind with the things I could do. Thoughts of draining his balls into each and every one of my holes became commonplace. 

He was nice to everyone, even me. He had no reason to like me. He barely knew me, but he would be perfectly willing to chat me up, even though everyone knew about my... reputation. Some others at his level knew enough to stay away from me, but he wasn't afraid to talk me up. I would be polite and cordial, but I had trouble hiding my annoyance, and I'm sure he could sense it. But that never stopped him from being friendly to me. That never stopped him from saying hello. And when he'd walk away from me, I'd roll my eyes at him in annoyance as my juices dripped down my legs. 

On one hand, I couldn't stand him and didn't want to be anywhere near him. On the other, I wanted to spread my legs for him, let him use me like a cheap fucking whore, and have all of his babies. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? 

**************** 

My name is Tori Kryselneski, but most of the time, I go by Tori K, because, trust me, I know my last name is a total nightmare. 

I was an assistant at a pretty big company. We designed and did research on some new technologies, and I worked at the corporate end. We did business with tons of major companies, both domestic and international, and...ugh, I'm boring myself here. None of that really matters. All that matters is that Paul worked with the sales team, and handled special projects and hiring, and I'm a fucking glorified secretary. 

As it usually did on most slow days, or days when I didn't feel like being productive, my thoughts drifted back to him. To Paul. 

We really couldn't be more different. He was the guy with the fancy degree, the former athlete. I was the college slut who barely graduated. We were the same age, but we couldn't be more opposite. He was the big success, the guy they sent to travel internationally to handle major deals, and I answer phone calls and get coffee. 

But that was about to change. 

One of the most valuable positions in the company had opened up, and I had put my name in the fray. And that job was an executive assistant. Executive assistant to Paul fucking Martin. 

Now, you may wonder why this job would appeal to me. I, who proclaimed to not being able to stand perfect Paul. Why would I want to work for a guy like him? 

That requires some explanation. 

As I mentioned before, I had a bit of a reputation. A reputation that would be offensive if it wasn't completely true. The word was out on me, and everyone seemed to be aware of it. 

To put it simply, I was a complete fucking slut. 

I wasn't ashamed of it. Why should I? I love sex, and I love having a lot of it, with a lot of different guys. How dare I pursue the pleasure that is hard- wired in all humans? So yeah, anyway, I was pretty whorish, and that meant that all that time and money my folks put in to get me through college and get me a good education was wasted. Instead of studying and gaining an appreciable professional skill, I spent most of my time on my back, gaining an extensive knowledge of frat-guy cock. My best talents were in the bedroom, and that would never change. Sex was the one place where I could be truly outstanding. 

I graduated with an essentially useless diploma, so I had to find a way to get by professionally. A girl's got to pay the bills, you know? I eventually ended up getting a low-level secretarial job here. And trust me, it was low-level. I am by no means a genius, but doing that work made me feel almost insulted. Is this what the world thought of me? Is this what they thought I was best qualified for? While I wasn't much of a student, I was very ambitious, and after a month or so of this work, I needed more. And I knew just how to do it. 

To put it bluntly, I used my many talents to grease a few poles, and coincidentally, I was promoted. What a shocker! 

I stayed as a secretary, but I worked for different managers. Slightly more important managers. And slowly, this process continued. My hot ass kept climbing up the corporate ladder. When I got bored or saw an opportunity, I sucked another dick, got another job, and added a few grand to my salary. It was a pretty sweet arrangement. The work was dull, for sure, and I could do it just fine. But the real game was the corporate game, that maneuvering up the corporate chain. While I wasn't much of a worker bee, I was very good at that other game. The corporate game. The game of business. I felt like I had a complete understanding of how business was done, but I hadn't had the full opportunity to show off my skills. Business wasn't about honorable negotiations. Real business was played dirty. I had no illusions about that. No ideals. I knew what motivated people deep down, and I played on that to great success. Business was all about sex, and in that sense, my body was built for business. My rise was equally as meteoric as Paul's, but not nearly as respectable. He worked in the boardroom, I worked between the sheets. 

But unfortunately, this kind of thing could only get me so far. My tricks and flirting made mincemeat of the low-level management, but the upper-level guys weren't nearly so easy to fool. They were obviously a bit more cautious and wary of intrepid little schemers like me. Plus, word had gotten out on me. I don't know how it got out, I'm guessing one of my old bosses aired my dirty laundry. But then again, it probably didn't take a rocket scientist to figure me out. No matter how progressive some people claim to be, when they take a look at a woman with a body like mine rising up the corporate ladder, they make certain assumptions. In my case, they happened to be true. 

I was far from the girl next door. I wasn't the innocent sunny type. I have been told I come across as bitchy and that I have a resting bitch-face. My lips were plump and curved into a natural sneer. I've been told my eyes seemed combative, as if I was spoiling for a fight. I wasn't afraid to speak my mind, and I had a bit of a dirty mouth. I could swear with the best of them, and I had a short temper. It was hard for me to contain my true feelings about people, and I was often the center of office gossip, some of it true, some made up. If I wasn't good at what I did, there would literally be no good reason to keep me around. But I was good. 

I was very good. 

It certainly didn't hurt that I was drop-dead sexy as well. 

I was slim and fit, but not overly so. I wanted to make sure I had curves in all the right places. And I definitely succeeded there. I had firm, thin legs, and I always wore high-heels to showcase them. They also highlighted my round, juicy, heart-shaped ass. I had a great ass, and I worked very hard for it. It was firm, round, and with just the right amount of jiggle. I had learned how to walk to best showcase it, and I made it a point to wear slim, figure hugging clothing, just to make sure that all eyes were on me. I wanted to make sure that my ass was a topic of office conversation, and I'm pretty confident my tight, slim skirts got the job done. 

My upper half held up its end of the bargain. I had superb breasts, a pair of round, smooth, juicy EE's, capped with perfectly-sized, hard, rubbery nipples. I always found a way to show my tits off, even at work, packing them in to tight tops, testing the limits of decency at times. I had been given a few warnings about showing a bit too much cleavage, so I was forced to cover up at times, but once I would get promoted and rise up the ladder, those buttons on my tops would get undone immediately, until I was warned again. 

I was a complete package. My hot body, poured into sexy business clothes, which I spent a sizable part of my salary on, by the way. My shiny, brunette hair was chopped stylishly just past my shoulders, and my make-up was always immaculate. I was the perfect embodiment of a corporate slut. 

This fact eventually became apparent to the higher-ups. It probably didn't help that I vigorously posted pictures online of me at the club, partying and drinking, grinding up all on hot guys, and some hot chicks as well. Word got out on me and people compared notes to the point where it became well known exactly how I ended up in this position, an assistant to an upper-middle manager. There was nothing concrete enough to fire me, but it became clear after a while that I had hit the ceiling, that they weren't gonna let a woman like me rise any higher on the ladder. I was the exact type of person this company didn't want to succeed. 

But I wasn't gonna let that stop me. It would only make my success sweeter. 

I had interviewed for higher positions many times, but the bosses were always cold and obviously disinterested in me. But I wasn't gonna let that get me down. I kept trying and trying, hoping one of these interviews would take, desperate to continue my meteoric rise. 

That brings me back to Paul. 

The job of executive assistant to Paul Martin was a highly prized position. That job would lead to big things to whoever held it. His last assistant, Edwin, had just left for another company, leaving the position open. A lot of people speculated about why he would choose to leave such a great, cushy job, but uh... haha, let's just say, I had some suspicions. But... that's another story. 

Nevertheless, the job had opened up. And when it did, when the position working for Paul opened up, it felt like serendipity. At that moment, it all clicked into place. The solution to all my problems. The glass ceiling I had hit, the way people in the office looked down at me, my obsession with Paul, I could solve all those problems in one fell swoop. An insidious plan formed in my pretty little head. If I played this right, I would have to go down as, like, the smartest bitch ever. 

I'm sure within an hour, Paul's inbox was filled with resumes. Mine was among them. 

Even though the word was out and I was not likely to rise any higher in the company, they couldn't just not allow me to apply for new positions. They still had to at least give me an interview, and at least let things play out. And this little bit of forced generosity was all I needed. For this job, that would put me and Paul, alone in a room, one on one. Perfect. That was exactly what I needed to put my plan into motion. And with his unwitting help, I was about to turn his life upside down. 

My plan was beautiful. A work of art. In one ambitious maneuver, I had figured out a way to not only get promoted and, like, double my paycheck, but also get to the bottom of my obsession with Paul and, if I played my cards right, I could take control of this company in a manner so bold that even the hardened execs at the top of the company would have to respect it. 

And the most beautiful part was, this plan relied on me doing the thing I did best. Better than just about anyone. What was my plan, you might ask? 

I was gonna fuck Paul Martin's brains out. 

I was gonna put his hard cock in my tight pussy and blow his fucking world apart. 

I was gonna conquer him. 

I was gonna make him mine. 

It was perfect. It was beautiful. And the sweetest part was, he was unwittingly the engineer of his own destruction. He had unwittingly created the blueprint for me to conquer him, and I was the first clever slut to figure that out.  

===

Beautiful. 

************** 

Obviously, for the position of working next to Paul, I would be interviewing with him personally. Even though he had only had a few assistants, that didn't mean he was inexperienced at the hiring process. In fact, the company had put Paul was in charge of hiring's, so he had plenty of experience with handling job interviews and he was no doubt quite good at it. The company was so proud of him that they published his personal guide to hiring on the website, proclaiming it like gospel. 

It was titled, quite simply, 'How to Get a Job'. Or, as it was known colloquially around the office, 'How to Get a Fucking Job'. The advice was fine, but the higher-ups shoved this guide so far down our throats that it became a bit of a joke. 

The tips were, as follows: 

1)Know Yourself Before I Meet You. 

2)Do Your Research! 

3)Control Your Image, Change the Conversation to Emphasize Your Strengths 

4)Set Yourself Apart. 

5)Cliché's Make My Eyes Glaze Over. 

6)Don't be Afraid to Blow Me Away. 

7)Think Outside the Box. 

8)Know When to Ignore This List. 

Good advice, right? Nothing too world changing, but he went into all of them in detail, and it was all good stuff. But I took it to heart, in my own twisted way. 

I had no allusions at being the first to interview with him to follow his list. But, I planned to do it in a way it had never been done before. Normally, I was more the type to let others do work for me, but for this, I did some serious work. Some crazy moving and shaking, things that could get me in serious trouble. But it was worth it. I was ready. This job was gonna be mine. And Paul was going to see the product of all that hard work. I was going all in. I was putting it all on the table. My frustration with the job, the glass ceiling I had hit, my annoyance and weird sexual obsession with Paul, it was all convalescing at this one moment it time. All of this work was for one clear goal. 

Sex. Hot and dirty, sweaty sex between me, the office slut, and Paul, the office golden boy. My whole career had been building to this moment, where I would have to test all the skills I had picked up in the bedroom against his skills in the boardroom. It was almost a philosophical conflict, a battle to determine whose way of life is truly more built for success. The people who work hard and do things right, or the people like me, who are willing to play very dirty. 

You might ask me why? Why would I want to work for Paul, after all the bad things I've said about him? I mean, yes, I was attracted to him, but despite his intoxicating presence, would it really be worth working alongside the guy who so clearly annoys me? 

My feelings for him hadn't changed. It was just, I couldn't wait any longer. This whole thing had to stop. I still found him turbo annoying, but he still made my clit fucking throb. The more I thought about him, the more fascinated I became. That annoyance and fascination with him had grown into an obsession. My frustration and obsession had turned into lust. I just couldn't stop thinking about him. I couldn't stop wondering why it was that this guy just did it for me in the worst way. It reached the point where every time I was hooking up with a guy, it was Paul I imagined in his place. It was madness. 

I never liked the good guys. They were always just so unbelievably dull. But Paul stood out. I hated him, and I hated that I lusted for him. My feelings were certainly passionate, one way another, but I had to figure out which way I truly felt. I had to get to the bottom of my feelings for him, for my own personal sanity. Either I had completely misjudged my own sexual desires, or... I had misjudged Paul. No... no. I was right about him. I was positive my assumptions about him true. 

I became convinced that there was an animal inside Paul, bursting to get out, hidden behind his perfectly tailored suits, and I was the only one that could see it. That was the conclusion I had come to. That his whole act, this whole person he portrayed himself as... it was total BS. I don't think he even was aware of the bullshit he was spewing. I think that he thought he was really that good of a guy. And to get to the bottom of this fascination I had with him, I had to prove him wrong. I had to prove that, behind that nice guy charm and amiable personality, there was a swaggering, cursing sex-god, ready to be brought to the surface. All men had that side of them. Some acted like they didn't, some acted holier than thou, but in the end, they all came crawling, and he was no different. That was the only possible explanation as to why I couldn't stop thinking about him. There was something about him that I was latching onto, that I was responding to, and that just had to be it. If that wasn't the case, if Paul was as good as he seemed to be, then I had no fucking idea what was going on in me. I would have no explanation about why he pushed all my buttons. 

It all had to come to a head at some point. It had to. And it would... during our interview. 

This weird sexual tension between us had dragged on long enough. I couldn't take it anymore. He annoyed me so fucking much, but I WANTED him. I wanted him bad. I couldn't think straight around him anymore. No man had ever made me act this way. It wasn't love, or anything like that. No, it was just... when I was around him, seeing his smile, smelling his natural scent... he made my body shiver. I had never wanted to spread my legs for any guy more than I did for him. 

He was so wrong for me. He was the good guy, Mr. Perfect, the apple of his mother's eye, who spent his free time helping others. I was the office skank, a girl others look down upon, who spends most of her free time taking excessive amounts of dick. 

I was convinced that, deep down, he liked me. In my interactions with him, he never looked down on me for my slutty behavior. He always treated me fairly, when others didn't. He didn't judge me for my choices. He gave me that same charming smile he gave everyone else. 

It seems as if perfect Paul Martin had a soft spot in his heart for the office slut. 

I planned to exploit that bit of kindness. Tear him apart, draw out the beast in him, and bring it to the surface. I would make him fuck me. I would command it, and like the good guy he was, he would comply. I would convince him logically that he had no choice but to do me, to get balls deep in the office slut. And once he did, this company would be in the palm of my hand, as would his heavy, swollen balls. 

I was gonna use his words against him. I would use his guide as a weapon, a step-by-step guide on how I would convince him to fuck me. I had it all planned out and ready to go. 

I would make him mine. I would shatter the glass ceiling, and convince the office good-guy to hire the office slut. I had to prove to everyone how right I was about perfect Paul Martin. I wanted to ruin him. I wanted to destroy his perfect image. I wanted to deface the piece of art that was his charmed life. The thought of doing that, of exposing the truth behind his act... it was intoxicating. I would corrupt the office saint and bring him down to my level. The thought of all the bosses seeing this anointed symbol of all that is good and true fall victim to the office slut made me dripping wet. 

Paul Martin would be mine. 

************* 

The morning of the interview, I looked into the mirror. 

My make-up... perfect. 

My lips, plump and juicy. 

Lipstick, subtle but sexy. 

Eyebrows plucked. 

Mani-pedi... fresh. 

My tan... immaculate. 

My skirt... slim and tight. 

My high heels... sexy. 

My bra, extra jiggly. 

Cleavage, exposed. 

My thong... tiny. 

My cunt... waxed. 

My asshole... bleached and ready. 

My resume was packed in my bag, alongside the USB containing my presentation. That presentation, my guide to seducing Paul Martin, was the key to everything. All my hard work was in that presentation. 

I was going all in. In twelve hours, I would either be promoted, or out of a job. There was no in-between. In twelve hours, I would either be emptying my desk, or be filled with Paul Martin's thick cum. But in my head, there wasn't any doubt. I was confident my plan would work. Paul would be mine. That promotion would be mine. And he didn't even see me coming. 

I looked at my reflection and blew myself a little kiss. 

"Let's get to work." 

*************** 

(Paul) 

The last interviews of the day always ended up being the memorable ones, without fail. They were never quick and easy. Something always seemed to come up. 

And knowing who I was interviewing, I expected that pattern to continue. 

My name is Paul Martin. And I was in need of a new assistant. 

My executive assistant Edwin had taken a job at a different company. I had worked with him for years, and he had grown under my tutelage, learning from me and my style of work. I prided myself for my integrity and honesty, while still being able to be firm and tough when necessary, on doing business the right way. So when Edwin took my lessons and went somewhere else, taking his talents to another company, I wasn't angry. I was proud. I was happy to know that someone else was out there, doing business the way I liked to see it done. His new job was very lucrative, which made the empty position he left behind very much in-demand. Most saw it as a ticket to higher things, the chance to learn some good skills and improve their professional standing. 

Many of the applicants were from within the company, some rising young talent who had come highly recommended. We had some applicants from outside the company, but a thorough knowledge of the work we did was gonna be required for the job, so more than likely, I would be hiring someone from within. 

The job was to basically work alongside me, to shadow me and help me out. I wasn't looking for a secretary. I was looking for something more than that. I needed someone in the boardroom with me, in the thick of it, learning, helping me out and contributing. I needed someone ready and willing to actively help out and go beyond the call of duty. I didn't need someone good. I needed someone outstanding. 

I'm not saying this because I am tough or wanted someone that I could run ragged. Far from it. I needed help! I considered myself a good boss, open to criticism and negotiation. I didn't want to be one of those guys who goes on a power trip once I get the smallest bit of authority and success. I had seen other people do that, and I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand seeing other people used in that way. When I worked that closely with someone, I didn't see any reason to make that relationship contentious. 

Not only was I looking for someone who could do the work, cause honestly, there was a lot of work, but I was looking for someone I could imagine myself bonding with. Someone who I could see as a friend. Me and Edwin were friends. I was one of the groomsmen at his wedding. When he told me about his new job, he did so with tears in his eyes. It was I who smiled and told him it was alright. That I was proud of him. Part of me was a bit worried about the uncertainty of having to find someone to fill such a huge role in my professional life. But another part of me was excited for this new adventure. 

My role in the company had only gotten larger the longer I had been here, and now in my eighth year, I had a lot of work on my plate. I traveled the world, and negotiated with some of the shrewdest businessmen and women in the world. It was tough, it was demanding, but I loved it. I loved the thrill of the negotiation. The feeling of a job well done. The validation of my bosses patting me on the back, knowing I got the job done. But, to be the best I could be, I needed someone there with me. I needed someone to cover my ass. I needed someone I could count on. 

I had already interviewed quite a few candidates, all of them extremely well qualified. I tried to prevent things from feeling too formal, since a lot of this job would depend on personal interaction. The candidates were clearly nervous and I did my best to ease the tension and get them to just breathe. I wanted them to give me their best and not leave with any regrets. For the most part, the interviews went well, and it was going to be a tough choice. I was almost done interviewing, so that big choice would come soon. 

But first, I had to interview Tori K. 

The fact that she applied for this job was a bit of a surprise, for a number of reasons. Looking at her resume... quite frankly, her qualifications didn't really compare to some of the others. Her references weren't nearly as impressive. And honestly, I didn't really even think she liked me that much. Her attitude towards me was icy at best. And most importantly, and most pressingly... she had a bit of reputation that followed her. 

To put it lightly, she had a reputation for sleeping around. It was alleged that that was how she had risen so high within the company, higher than her education and work performance would imply. 

I made it a point to not give life to any rumors, to be my own judge of people. But, the evidence seemed pretty overwhelming. She certainly acted the part. Her attitude, her tone, the way she dressed, it all supported the story. I had once heard her described as being 'nasty hot', and while I certainly never looked at her that way, I could see the point. Tori was very attractive, but in a way that you could just tell she was not exactly the... purest... of women. She was attractive, with an impressive body, and she dressed in a manner to support these rumors. As much as I hated to give life to those nasty rumors, the story seemed to check out. 

But in a sense, it didn't really matter what I thought. My bosses seemed to believe the story, and while it had never been explicitly said, it was heavily implied that a woman of Tori's reputation would never be allowed to rise any further in this company. They would be happy to have her just be gone, but they didn't have any grounds to get rid of her. So, while this hire was entirely up to me, I could feel the pressure on my shoulders to not hire Tori. 

Not that she would be hired anyway. I try to be as open-minded as possible, but her resume just did not compare to the other applicants. And plus, I wanted someone on my side who shared my value system, who felt the same way on how to conduct business. I took pride in doing business the right way. I didn't feel the need to use any dirty business strategies or underhanded tactics to get things done. Sure, some of those bad things may give you a short term benefit, but in the long term, the house of cards constructed by bad business would collapse. I was positive of that. The people who did business that way never thought of the long term implications of their actions. 

I was happy to give Tori a chance, but she would have to plead a pretty convincing case for her to have a shot. I had never interviewed her, so I didn't know exactly what to expect from her or what she was capable of, but if she wanted this job she would have to earn it. 

I always liked to take a few minutes to clear my head before an interview. I stopped thinking about Tori, about the job, and decided to just take in things for a few moments. I was again amazed by my station in life, and how I had gotten here. I was raised by humble middle-class parents who instilled good values in me. I worked hard, put in years of hard work. And now I'm here. In a window office on the 32nd floor of the tallest building in the city. Working for a huge company that has put the utmost amount of trust, faith and support in me, and has given me all these blessings. I approached the window, letting my eyes take in the city, proud that I had risen so high. 

I could see my reflection in the mirror, my gray, stylish suit still looking pretty neat after a long work day. My blue button-up shirt was a little cock- eyed, so I straightened it out. I looked at my own face in the mirror, and gave myself a smile. I tried my best to always look the part, to dress for the job I wanted, so I took pride in my nice clothes, especially since there were times in my younger life where I didn't have that luxury. 

I turned around and took in my office, and even that filled me with pride. At times, it felt like I was still an unsure teenager in grown-up clothes, but whenever I sat in my office and took it in, I felt like I belonged. 

Everything in my office was there for practicality. Some people liked to have fancy trinkets or impressive tech, but I simply wanted stuff that worked, that made my life easier. I had two computers, one that I did my work on and a spare one that was hooked up to a projector for whenever someone needed computer access or needed to give a presentation. The far wall was left blank, no decorations, where the image could be projected. I was always a bit scattered, so I had a few piles of papers on my desk, but I knew where everything was. My desk was made of a dark, heavy wood, and although at first I thought it was a bit much, I had to eventually admit that it was pretty cool. It really cemented my role in the company in my own mind, and it really cemented that I had made it. This was the type of desk a grown-up, professional businessman had, and it was my desk. It was great. 

I didn't have too many creature comforts or personal items. I had a couch along the side wall for when I was hosting some people or when I just needed to relax for a few minutes. I did have a flat-screen TV, but I would try to keep its use to a minimum, mainly keeping the news or the weather on. The only other real prominent personal items were the pictures on my desk of my wife. My eyes fell to one of the pictures, looking at my wife's smiling face, as if she was looking at me, giving me strength after a long and busy week. 

I rubbed my eyes and glanced at the clock. I loved my work, I would never complain, but, it had been a long week, and I was exhausted. I had done a lot of traveling lately, and because of that I was playing catch-up. That, on top of doing all these interviews, it had worn me out. And plus, it had kept me away from Andrea. 

It still felt surreal to be married to the boss's daughter, but it was one of those love at first sight sort of things. The CEO had had introduced us one day, clearly in the hopes of setting us up, but to be honest, we had already met before at the Christmas Party the year earlier. That first sight, seeing her long gorgeous, shiny blonde hair, her perfect smile, her lovely slim dress... she looked like an angel. I know it sounded corny, but I fell in love with her right there. And to be honest... we had started dating then, way before my boss introduced us. He didn't know that me and his daughter already knew each other and were dating. I was always a pretty good guy, and exceedingly honest, so I was nervous about being deceptive and secretive about dating the boss's daughter. But I had to admit there was a certain thrill at taking part in something so forbidden. Luckily, the boss eventually introduced us formally, giving us an excuse to be seeing each other. 

She was the opposite of what you'd expect from the daughter of a CEO. She was the farthest thing from corporate. She was sweet and loving and friendly. And warm. She just had a great, charitable spirit, and she stayed away from the family business, preferring to shape the future as a kindergarten teacher. She loved it, and seeing her with those kids, how she cared for them, and how crazy they were about her, I felt good about choosing her as my wife, the future mother of my children. 

Work had kept us both busy, and I was looking forward to getting this weekend off. We were heading up to a place on a lake for a couple days. We had both been so exhausted that we hadn't had the chance to be... intimate... in a while. And we were both feeling it. We were both looking forward to blowing off some stress on a long, romantic weekend together.  

===

Knowing I had a few minutes before the interview was set to begin, I pulled my phone from the pocket of my suit jacket and pulled up some pictures of me and Andrea. I know it sounds dorky and cheesy, but I couldn't get enough of just looking at her. Seeing someone so pretty, with such an infectious smile, and such an effervescent personality, and knowing she had chosen me to marry, it filled my heart with love. I don't know what I did to be so lucky. 

I was looking at a picture of us standing together outside of a nice older movie theatre downtown, my arm around her. Her brilliant smile let me know that she was as happy with me as I was with her. I admired her again, her silky blonde hair, her slim, taut runner's body. It reminded me of how proud I was that she had run multiple marathons, not just for personal accomplishment, but to raise awareness for various children's charities. She was such an amazing, impressive woman, and I couldn't imagine loving anyone as much as I loved her. 

For a moment, I was overtaken with an almost overwhelming obsession for the woman I married. I was again reminded of my current predicament and the plans we had for this weekend, and as much as I loved interviewing and this whole process, at this moment, it was the last place I wanted to be. I couldn't wait to leave, to just be around Andrea again. 

A knock at the door caused me to jump. I pocketed my phone and stood up as one of the women from HR poked her head in my office. 

"Hey Paul," Shanice said, "Miss, um... Miss Krez..." she began, glancing down at her file, struggling with the name. 

"Miss Tori Kryselneski," I finished for her, stepping around my desk, straightening my suit-coat. 

"Yes, Miss Kryselneski is here for her interview," Shanice said, thankful for my help. 

"Send her in," I replied with a smile. "And you can head out, Shanice. I'll finish up here." Shanice smiled and thanked me, before stepping aside. From behind her entered Tori, stepping past the HR woman to enter the office. 

"You might be the first person to pronounce my last name correctly," Tori began with a smile. "I'm impressed." 

"Hey, I do my research too," I said with a smile, moving towards her. 

She certainly looked the part of an executive assistant. Despite the fact that she had to know she wasn't nearly as qualified as some of the other candidates, it was clear she was taking this interview seriously, which I was impressed with. She was dressed to the nines and made-up and styled, without overdoing it. I had to admit, despite everything that was said about her, I couldn't help but be struck by how stunning she truly was. 

As I shook her hand, she smiled at me, showcasing her full, glossy lips. Her eyes met mine, and her striking eyes and dark eyeliner held my gaze for a moment too long. I pulled my hand from hers and guided her towards the chair across from me. Her outfit seemed perfectly fitted too her, a nice looking business suit. The slim jacket was fitted well to her upper half, and her knee- length black skirt clung to her legs and rear. She had on black stockings and high-heels, all in black, professional, but attractive. She slid her leather portfolio down onto the heavy wood table, and as she did, I noticed the silky, white blouse under her jacket, a few buttons near the top undone, not to an indecent level, mind you, but enough to show off the glowing, smooth skin of her upper chest. And, she wore a small, dangling necklace, the bauble on the front nestled in the hint of smooth cleavage left exposed by the slightly unbuttoned blouse. And although the blouse looked expensive and professional, it was clear from the color contrast that she was wearing a red, lace bra beneath the silky white top. 

I didn't leer at her or anything like that, I just noted it, as I would with any other applicant. Because one of the big things about an interview is how the applicant presents themselves. It tells you a lot. And her look was telling me that while she was trying to come across as professional, she wasn't afraid to use her obvious appeal to her advantage. 

As she moved to her chair, I watched her eyes scan the room, gaining a sense of where everything was. Her eyes hung on the couch along the far wall for a few moments before she took her seat, sitting down in one of the office chairs across from me, her perfectly styled brown hair shimmering on her shoulders as she did so. She unbuttoned her suit-jacket as she sat, sitting up straight, pushing out her chest ever so slightly. 

She had large breasts and she knew it. Very, very large breasts, a size you don't often see in an office setting. Among the office's male population, her boobs were a common source of conversation, the uninitiated seeking out those who had seen them in the flesh, seeking out the juicy details. I never participated in that kind of rumor mongering, and people knew that, as that kind of conversation tended to cease whenever I was around. But, I was a man and it wasn't like I hadn't noticed her impressive bust size. And they were great breasts, for sure, but I guess I just wasn't the type of guy to go gaga over a pair of boobs. I could appreciate them, but that wasn't gonna sway my feelings on her either way, no matter how much flesh she showed off. It was a little unprofessional to dress provocatively in the office, as she tended to do, but I wasn't about to tell anyone how they should present themselves. I wasn't gonna tell anyone to cover up or lecture them on how they live their lives. Her showing off a hint of cleavage didn't matter to me. It wasn't gonna help me make up my mind either way. It would take a lot more than a large pair of breasts to make me hire someone. 

According to her file, she had been reprimanded about not adhering to the dress code, so it was clear she knew how to use her body's assets to her advantage, and was willing to push the limits whenever she had the opportunity. Her top was by no means indecent, but it hugged her slim frame, and it struggled to contain her excessively large boobs. The top few buttons that she actually had buttoned were being tested by the two large mounds stuffed inside. 

As I said before, it was important for me to note how the applicant presented themselves and now that I had given her the once over, I promised not to acknowledge that aspect of this process again. I didn't want to give her the impression I was leering at her, and I didn't want to let myself be unprofessional and let my current predicament get the better of me. 

"So, how was Italy?" she asked in a tone more genial than I had ever heard from her before. 

"Oh, it was good. I got the account. It was tough, but I finally got them into the fold. But the country itself was incredible. And the architecture there... amazing." I replied, discussing my recent business trip there. 

"I think I heard you'll be going to Brazil soon?" she asked. 

"Uh, yeah, looks like it." I said, not sure how she knew that. 

"Well... maybe I'll be with you by the time you go there," she said with a smile, opening up her portfolio and retrieving her professional looking resume and cover letter, sliding it over to me. 

"Yeah, maybe." I replied with an even smile, taking the resume and glancing at it, even though she had to know I had looked at it up and down well before the interview. "So... you ready?" I asked with a smile. 

"I was born ready." she replied confidently. I could appreciate that confidence. 

"I like to keep these interviews pretty conversational, you know, as opposed to me asking you questions and you answering. That kind of boilerplate structure feels too... stuffy... to me, you know what I mean?" 

"Right," she replied, "But I'm way ahead of you on this one." 

"What do you mean?" I asked, slightly surprised. 

"I actually made a little presentation on why you should hire me," she said with a smile, pulling out a USB stick from her portfolio. "Do you mind?" she asked, gesturing at a laptop hooked up to a projector. 

"Oh... sure." I said, pleasantly surprised at her going above and beyond like this. She stood up from her seat, running her hands down her hips, smoothing out her tight skirt over her rear. 

"Don't seem so surprised Paul," she began with a laugh, stepping towards the projector. "I don't know if you've heard, but I have a bit of reputation." I held my breath, wondering what she was about to say. "I'm a very good interview," she said with a knowing smile, as if in on the joke. 

"Right." I said with an even laugh. She tapped away at the laptop for a few moments before the front page of her presentation projected onto the wall. 

"There we go..." she said to herself. She slid off her jacket and set it on the back of her chair, exposing her smooth, bare arms, clad only in the short sleeves of her top. With the slight bulkiness of her jacket removed, her large breasts were even more noticeable, standing out proudly from her chest. I quickly looked away, hoping she didn't notice. I dimmed the lights slightly with a remote to make the image on the wall clearer. She took a deep breath, stood next to the projection, and turned to me. "So, before I begin, I want to make a deal with you." she started. 

"Sure, what is it?" I asked, curious. 

"The case I'm about to make is very... unorthodox," she began. "All I ask is that you agree to hear me through, because I think I can make the case as to why I am the absolute best woman for the job. You might not agree with me at the beginning, but if you hear me out, I think I can change your mind." 

"Deal." I replied warmly, willing to give her a chance. 

"I'm gonna hold you to that," she said with a slight smile and a pointed look. She tapped a button on the projector remote to begin the presentation. The first page of the presentation was very familiar. They were words I knew well. 

How to Get a Job 

1)Know Yourself Before I Meet You. 

2)Do Your Research! 

3)Control Your Image, Change the Conversation to Emphasize Your Strengths 

4)Set Yourself Apart. 

5)Cliché's Make My Eyes Glaze Over. 

6)Don't be Afraid to Blow Me Away. 

7)Think Outside the Box. 

8)Know When to Ignore This List. 

"Now, I am sure I'm not the first person to base their interview around your list of tips," she began, gesturing to the list projected on the wall, my list of eight tips to get hired. "And, I have to admit, as badly as the bosses shove these tips down our throats, there are some pretty good ones here. And to prepare for this, I have to confess even I studied them," she said with a laugh, every gesture she made causing her breasts to bounce ever so slightly. 'Stop it, Paul,' I warned myself. "Now, I didn't want to just recite them and answer them one by one. I wanted to put my personal spin on them. It took a while, but I think I figured it out." 

"To summarize, I know myself very well. I've done a hell of a lot of research. I know my image and how to use it. I know my strengths and how to set myself apart. I hate clichés, and I am very good at rocking people's words. And trust me, this presentation is gonna be so far outside the box, so far away from what this list was designed for, that you won't know how you didn't see this coming." 

"Bring it on." I challenged her, amused and impressed by the effort she was putting in to this. She wasn't exactly known as the hardest of workers, so this was refreshing to see. 

"I think the biggest thing here for me is knowing myself and changing the conversation," she resumed. "I've looked at the other candidates and compared them to myself, and quite honestly, in any appreciable way, they've got me beat. They all have the experience, the education, the training, the sparkling reputation... and I don't. I get that. I know my place, my role, and how I got here. So, if you're just going off of a resume, I'll probably lose." 

"Okay." I said, curious as to where she was going with this, surprised at her still confident tone while acknowledging her own weaknesses. 

"But what I'm going to do here is to convince you to ignore the resume. I'm going to convince you to ignore the degrees and the experience and all of that bullshit, cause none of it really matters anyway." she said, looking right at me with a serious expression. I gave her a quizzical look. 

"And how do you intend to do that?" I asked. 

"Simple... I change the conversation." she took a deep breath before advancing. "If you want to hire an assistant, the perfect little worker bee, you can choose one of them," she said, pointing out the door. "But you're not gonna be hiring an assistant, Paul," she said, looking at me with a knowing smirk. 

"What am I going to be hiring, then?" I asked, interested. 

"You're hiring not what you ask for but what you need. What you've always needed, what any man of your stature needs. Like I said, you're not going to hiring an assistant," she paused and stepped closer, leaning over the edge of the desk, looking right at me, before speaking her next words slowly and clearly. 

"What you need is a slut." 

The room went silent. My throat went dry, and my heartbeat went rapid. I looked at her, not sure if she was serious, but she looked down at me with a twinkle in her eye. She licked her lips, and as her large breasts hung down over the desk, deliberately being showcased, her deep cleavage evident. Was she really doing this? Was she actually, brazenly offering...I think she was! I was shocked and completely taken off-guard. Finally, I found words. 

"Is this a joke, Tori?" I asked with a raised eyebrow. "Are you serious?" 

"Deadly serious," she replied, standing up straight, and walking back towards the projection, shaking her butt at me, each of the round full cheeks jiggling with every step. 

"Tori... this is really inappropriate!" I began. "If this is some sort of bad joke, I can understand, but if this is serious... you're not gonna keep your job here." I warned, not wanting her to make a career killing mistake. 

"I'm taking your advice. I'm changing the conversation. If you hiring a totally professional, qualified executive assistant doesn't favor me, why not change the conversation?" she said, holding her arms out, shaking her boobs slightly. "Just hear me out, and I will convince you that what you need, more than an assistant, more than a wife, is a dirty fucking whore," she asserted. 

"Tori... you can't do this. Do I need to call security?" I asked, shaking my head. 

"Paul, you agreed to hear me out, no matter what," she began, her genial attitude gone. 

"Well, when we made that deal, I thought you planned to be somewhat reasonable." I replied. 

"I'm not gonna force anything on you. I made a presentation! That's it! And all I'm doing is using logic and reason. If, by the end, you still feel this strongly, I will walk away. But I think I can change your mind, and if I do, I will certainly blow your mind. I will make you realize how important it is to have a slut working by your side. Paul, I just want to make it clear, by the end of this, we WILL be having sex. You will have me bent over your big, hard desk and be drilling my hot ass till I fucking scream!" 

I was completely dumbstruck. I had been in some of the toughest boardrooms in the world, but... I had never been this caught off guard, ever. I wasn't prepared for this. I didn't know what to do. I put my head in my hands. 

"Tori, I stood up for you. I gave you a chance here, and this is what you do?" I asked, pleading for her to reconsider. 

"Well, I am a slut." Tori said, shrugging, causing her boobs to bounce. "This is what sluts do. And deep down, I think you wanted this too. Deep down, you knew it would come to this. You've been desperate to find a reason for us to start hooking up, and now you have it." 

"No... I..." I began, shaking my head. I began counting off on my fingers. "I'm a boss. I'm married. I'm a professional... need I go on?" 

"At least let me finish." Tori pleaded. "What's the worst that can happen? I mean, if you're right, if I don't have a chance, then you just have a story to tell your friends, about how that dirty whore made a move on you. I mean, you're not actually worried that I'm right... right?" she asked with a knowing glance. I sat back and rubbed my chin, not knowing what to do. "I mean, this is certainly outside the box, right?" she asked with a laugh. "Just give me a shot? 

This was so wrong and so inappropriate for so many reasons. Like I said, I'm a married man, very happily married. Plus, I was a professional, and I was never the type to do anything like this. She was barking up the wrong tree here, for sure. I don't know why she thought this would actually work. But, part of me was curious of what her plan actually was. What could she say to logically convince me to cheat on my wife? What could she possibly say to change my mind? It was so ridiculous that I was morbidly curious. I know I should just kick her out, but I abhorred conflict, and despite what she was pulling here, I didn't want to be the one to destroy her career. So, despite my better judgment, if she agreed to just walk away when this was all said and done, then just maybe I could just hear out her ridiculous argument and then be done with her. 

"And you'll leave when you're done?" I asked. 

"Agreed." she said, smiling wickedly, thinking in her mind, that she actually had an opportunity. 

"I can't believe I'm doing this... fine. Fine!" I relented. "Give me your worst. I'll hear you out, but when you're done, you're done here. If you walk away now, we can just forget this. But if you go through with this, I have to fire you. You understand?" 

"Deal," she agreed, eyes flashing, clearly feeling no fear. She clicked the button to advance the presentation. With a new pep in her step, she sauntered over next to the projection, again shaking her round ass at me. She pointed at the image, which was titled with the first step of my list followed by a blank page, and continued. 

"Okay, the first thing you recommend is to 'Know Yourself Before I Meet You,' and the one thing about me is that I know exactly who I am," she began, before hitting the clicker, causing some images to enter the blank page of the presentation. These pictures made my eyes grow wide. 

There were four pictures, and they were of Tori. But these were not pictures of her at work. No, they were far from professional. These were pictures of her at play. The top left picture was her at a club, dancing, coated with sweat from the no-doubt heated atmosphere she was dancing in. She was wearing a tight purple top, scooped low so her large boobs were just pouring out from within. She wore a skirt that barely went below her ass, and as she danced, the skirt flared up, millimeters away from showing off what was underneath. 

The top right picture was her at some sort of house party, and in it there was a picture of her dancing in front of some guy, her back pressed against his front. His hands were on her breasts, squeezing them firmly, causing them to nearly overflow from beneath her silky red top. And as this invasion of her person took place, she was simply smirking, as if everything was going exactly to plan. 

The bottom left picture was her at work, but she wasn't exactly working. It was a picture she clearly quickly snapped of her bent over a desk, a suit-clad man behind her, his face hidden, clearly... obviously having, uh... relations... with her. While she was still clothed, her outfit looked astray, as if what was happening was very aggressive and rough. And on her face, that same satisfied smirk. 

The bottom right picture was her in what was probably her apartment, standing in front of a mirror. She looked perfectly coiffed and styled, her face turned into a wicked looking kiss, but her outfit was absolutely filth. A trashy looking tight blue tank top, the spaghetti straps digging into her shoulders due to the stress caused by her mammoth rack. Her top was molded to her large breasts, showing off their perfectly smooth, round shape, and there were clear indents caused by her throbbing nipples. Her midriff was exposed, leaving her fit belly bare. Down lower, she wore a tiny, denim skirt, cut way too short, barely covering her nether-regions. Her long legs were bare, smooth and firm, leading to some trashy high-heels. Her outfit was obscene and looked incredibly skanky, but it was clear that was the look she was going for.  

===

"Like I said, Paul, I know exactly who I am," she continued, talking in a seemingly professional manner while showcasing these obscene images. "I am a slut! A huge slut! The sluttiest of the sluts. The skankiest of the skanks. The trashiest of the trashy. The whoriest of the whores. Ever since I grew tits, I've been letting guys, and the occasional girl, play with them. I've been told I should be ashamed of myself, that no one likes a slut, but I don't care. I love it! I love being a slut! It's my best my quality. Paul, I am really, REALLY, good at sex, like, amazing at it. You do your work in the boardroom, I work in the bedroom." 

"Oh my God..." I said to myself, rubbing my eyes in disbelief at what was happening in front of me. When I looked up at her, she smiled, loving my consternation. She was loving it so much that her nipples were evident beneath her top, throbbing to escape into the cool air of my office. And I had a bad feeling, no matter what I said and did, they would be soon getting their wish. Why was I letting this happen? 

"Now, the next step you list is 'Do Your Research', and, as you will see a little bit later in this presentation, I have gone above and beyond in that category," she said with a hungry smirk, as if desperate to reveal that delicious part of the plan, a plan that made her mouth water. "But before that, the next part is what I mentioned before. I'm controlling my image. Like I've said repeatedly, to put it bluntly, I'm a slut." 

Tori paused for a moment, putting her hands on her hips, jutting her chest out, showing off her impressive frame. 

"I mean, look at me," she began. Staring right at me, she brought her hands up and slid them under her large breasts, bouncing them in her palms before squeezing them lightly, grazing her fingers over her protruding nipples. She turned to the side and let her hand slide down her torso and over her round, jutting ass. "It's no secret I'm the office slut. With a body like mine, it's hard not to be. I'm built for sex... what's wrong with me doing what I'm good at?" 

I simply shook my head. I didn't know if I was just tired and this was some strange dream, but I couldn't figure out how to respond to this bold attempt at seduction. Tori turned back to face me and brought her hands to her top. Working deftly, her fingers got to work, unbuttoning her blouse. This motion caused me to jump slightly. Was she disrobing just like that? 

"No need for me to play it coy anymore," she stated, unbuttoning her top halfway down, so her giant, barely covered breasts and red bra were exposed. "If I accept that I'm a slut, I've got to at least look like one. And besides, there's nothing wrong with a bit of cleavage," she said proudly, downplaying the size of the crevasse between her bulbous breasts that was now exposed to me. "It's all good, clean fun, right?" she chirped with a sickeningly sweet smile. 

I didn't respond. I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea to let this play out. She probably took this as some sort of endorsement of her crazy plan. 

"Tori, this has gone too far already..." I began, keeping my cool as I looked to end this. 

"But, I'm just getting started," she replied, "And you promised to hear me out." 

"Yeah, well, I think I've seen enough." I responded, looking away from her. 

"Hon, you haven't seen anything yet," she said wickedly. Undeterred, and before I could interrupt her again, she continued her presentation. "So, anyway, clearly, I know myself very well. But part of this is you knowing yourself, knowing who YOU really are," she said, pointing at me. 

"What?" I asked, a bit exasperated with this whole game already. 

"Now, I don't know if you know this, but I've never really liked you that much," she admitted. This admission caused me to bark in laughter. 

"If you don't even like me, then... why are you even doing this?" I replied, raising my hands questioningly. 

"Exactly," she said, pointing at me as if I hit the exact point she was making. "I couldn't figure it out either. I mean, I find you annoying and completely full of shit. I see your act. I know what you do. No one else does, but I do. I could see through your bullshit, I can't stand this fucking good guy act of yours, but I couldn't stop thinking about riding your, no doubt, fat cock until I can't think straight." 

"Jesus," I said, sweating a little, shocked at her casual depravity. 

"Trust me, you are SO not the type of guy I'm normally into. I mean, no offense, but to a girl like me, you're kinda boring. Guys like you don't typically have the type of fun that women like me need. So, I started thinking... maybe there's more to you than meets the eye. Maybe deep down, beyond that stiff, dull, boring façade, this whole good guy, everybody's friend act, maybe there's a dirty fucking stud just BURSTING to get out," she said, smiling proudly, acting out an explosion with her arms, causing her big breasts to bounce. "Bursting to get out... dying to be exactly the type of guy I crave." 

At this hypothesis, I simply closed my eyes and rubbed my palm on my forehead. 

"Tori..." I began. 

"I know you think I'm completely off-base, but think about it. I mean, I can't stand you, but for some reason, I can't stop thinking about you. The only explanation is that you are, in fact, exactly my type of guy. And, if I'm right, that would make me exactly you're type of girl," she said perkily, looking down at me. I couldn't help but let out a small laugh. 

"Ha... Tori, you certainly have a very... interesting... view of things, but you are completely off-base." I said, trying to be as civil as possible considering what she was proposing. 

"I knew you would say that," she said, smirking while rolling her eyes. Looking upwards, she continued. "I mean, it is kind of odd that you seem to always find an excuse to talk to me. You've heard the stories. The nasty rumors. A guy like you in management shouldn't be caught anywhere near a dirty slut like me, but you always found a reason to stop and chat. Chat it up with the office skank." 

"I talk to everybody! That's part of being a good manager!" I said, losing my patience slightly. 

She was right about one thing. I had heard plenty of rumors about her. Even though, as I said before, I didn't give life to rumors, that didn't mean I hadn't heard them. And the more she went on, as over-the-top as this had already gotten, the crazy things I had heard about her were starting to sound more believable. 

Obviously, I had heard that had fucked her way to her current position, but those rumors were positively tame compared to some others I had heard. Among those things was that she had willingly performed a full-on strip tease on one of the desks down on the fifth floor during a Christmas party. I had also heard a rumor that we had hired a really good prospect straight out of college a few years back, and on his first day, he was caught fucking Tori in one of the supply closets. They were caught by one of the bosses, and although the guy was immediately fired, Tori eventually convinced the guy who caught them to fuck her, turning this penalty into a promotion. Another thing was that one of the other secretaries was spreading nasty rumors about Tori to whoever would listen. Tori apparently went to that woman's house and slept with her husband. That woman quit the next day. I had also heard that there was an email thread with sexy pictures of Tori, promising full-on shots of her naked breasts. And then, to my surprise, that email had ended up in my inbox, but I had been a good guy and deleted the email immediately without opening it. 

At times seemed like there was a secret club of men who had been spent one wild night with Tori K. A brotherhood. And you would think that her sole success with men in the company with be with that type of swarthy, douchebags who were willing to play at her level. One of THOSE guys, you know? But then it would be revealed that someone that I was aware knew better energetically leapt into bed with her. Fallen victim to her wiles. One of my oldest friends, a guy named Louis that I had gone to college with, after he left the company, the rumor was that he had cheated on his girlfriend with Tori. I knew he would never do that kind of thing, that this was just a nasty rumor. But when me and a few co- workers ran into him, and one of them brought up Tori, knowingly mentioning her body to him, I could see the heat behind his eyes, and it was clear there was some sort of history there between him and Tori. 

I tried to keep my head above this stuff, but these rumors had a habit of reoccurring, no matter how much I tried to avoid them. Even I had my weak moments. When I had heard a guy talking worshipfully about her chest, although he shut down the conversation as soon as he saw me, there was a part of me kinda hoping to hear more, just cause of deep seeded masculine curiosity. If the rumors were true, Tori had a habit of making men do bad things, and staying above the fray seemed to be the best idea. 

"But even good managers know better than to be seen with a whore like myself." Tori continued, as if reading my mind, but was simply continuing the conversation we had been having. "Every other one of the big managers steer well clear of me, but not you. Every chance you get, you leap at the opportunity to talk to me. A good guy like you... you just want a little taste of the other side, don't you? A sample of the dark delights you're missing out on," she said, her voicing lowering to a lusty tone, moving around the desk. 

Why did I talk to her? I mean, like I said, I liked to judge people for myself, but there was pretty overwhelming evidence in the case of Tori K. Sure, I would never not be cordial to someone and I think that was all I was with her. I never wanted anything more from her. I didn't want her to flirt with me. I wasn't interested in her in that way. It wasn't like I was one of THOSE guys... right? All those guys, who acted like they disliked Tori or looked down at her, but when the time came they were still happy to leap into bed with her. No... no. I wasn't like that. I was not that type of guy. I had self-control. I was better than that. But Tori was unconvinced. 

"You kid yourself into thinking you're being nice, but you just want to get close to me. You want to smell me. And maybe, if you get lucky, you'll get one good taste..." she said, moving in close, purring in my ear, causing me to shiver. I felt the softness of her huge breasts pressing against my arm, and this contact caused me to jump. I moved away from her, not daring to look, as she stepped back around the table, content with not pushing forward too quickly. 

"I think perfect Paul Martin has a little crush..." she began, cocking her head at me slightly as she walked back towards her projected presentation. "I think someone's in love with my huge titties!" she sang, giving them a little jiggle. I couldn't help but glance at them for a moment, but it was enough. Her smirk told me she noticed. 

"So, by the end of this interview, I will not only prove that you need a slut like me by your side, but I will prove that you are actually the dirty, slut- mongering asshole you pretend you're not." she said professionally, as if presenting the fourth quarter earnings. 

"Okay, so, I'm gonna power through a couple of the other points so I can get to the good stuff. With your point about clichés making your eyes glaze over, clearly, you've never seen anything like me. And besides, it's not gonna be cliché's making your eyes glaze over. And, not being afraid to blow you away... I mean, c'mon? You're practically spelling out how you want a slut on her knees... 'blowing you' away. And then, thinking outside the box, ignoring the list... clearly, I'm way ahead of you there," she said, quickly clicking through the slides. 

"And that brings me to the good stuff," she said, smiling wickedly, as if this was the moment she had been waiting for. She clicked to the next slide. "Now, there are two points left... 'Set Yourself Apart' and 'Do Your Research'. And, to me, they're intertwined. Now, there are plenty of other candidates, and as I said before, their qualifications are impeccable. They have me beat. But, to take my place as your personal whore, then it's not the other applicants I'm competing against," she paused, and gave me a smug, arrogant glance. "The person I'm competing against is your wife." 

She advanced the slideshow, and up appeared a picture of Andrea, my wife. I moved forward in my seat slightly, caught off guard. The picture was just showing her face, the sun shining through her hair, her brilliant teeth flashing at the camera. It was a great picture, but knowing it was Tori showing me this sent a surge of concern through me, as if I knew deep down what she was about to do. 

"This is your wife, Andrea. Pretty as a peach, and sweet as can be." Tori affirmed. "I've met her, and yeah, she is as nice as everyone says. She is totally perfect wife material," she said, her lip curled up slightly, as if there was something insidious hidden within this seemingly sweet compliment. She advanced the slides forward to another picture, this one of Andrea and Tori, standing side-by-side at a Christmas party, smiling. "Girls sniff each other out immediately. And even a girl like Andrea, the sweet perfect Kindergarten teacher, she had to know I was the office skank. But like the sweetheart she is, and like the nice, sweet husband she married, she didn't shy away from chatting me up, being friendly and nice to the dirtiest tramp in the office. Of course, her daddy pulled her away pretty quick, cause he knows better, but you two, you're like moths to the flame, attracted to your own destruction." 

I sat there in silence, waiting for the other shoe to drop. As if on cue... 

"But..." she began, with an arrogant smirk, "We did have time to snap this picture, and honestly, I think this kind of sums up the whole thing." The picture itself was in the office, Andrea and Tori side by side. Andrea looked stunning, her golden blonde hair hanging down past her shoulders, perfectly styled. She wore a slim cocktail dress, the material hugging her slim, athletic body. It was formal and tasteful, not showing too much of anything. Her chest was mostly covered, only the upper chest bared, and the dress went down to her knees. Her legs appeared from the dress, leading down to her stylish high- heels. She looked stunning. She was the perfect picture of restrained, mature, adult, feminine sexuality. Classy, but restrained. 

Tori was the opposite. 

If Andrea was in a cocktail dress, Tori was in a prom dress. Andrea's cocktail dress was a formal black, Tori's was a flashy red. Tori wanted all eyes on her, and with the amount of skin she was showing, she was succeeding. The dress was scooped very low, showing an expansive amount of her bulbous breasts and deep cleavage. The dress molded to her voluptuous frame and covered just enough of her to remain decent. The dress ended halfway up her thighs, and the thin straps left her arms bare. On her feet were a pair of high-heels, which helped showcase her long, firm legs. Her makeup looked more like she was ready for a night at the club, and her hair was perfectly composed in a wild, wicked manner. 

While Andrea's look came across as composed and classy, Tori looked more brazen and wild. Something about her, not only her outfit, but her look, her hair, her makeup... there was a certain wickedness that came across very obviously. Andrea was smiling warmly in the photo, but Tori, she was almost smirking, as if teasing the viewer. 

"You see it, just like I do. Your wife, looking great, just the perfect corporate wife, and me, the office whore, looking even better." Tori stated. "Now, I'm not just doing this to show pictures of me looking hot. This is the lead in to the main... thrust... of my pitch as to why I should be your assistant. And that pitch is how I, Tori K, have your wife beat in every possible way." With that, she pulled a laser pointer from her pocket and continued. 

"Now, I want you to look at the picture, Paul, really examine it," she teased, but that smirk of her was getting under my skin, and she knew it. Through gritted teeth, I just looked up at her, my silence the only assent I was gonna give her. She pointed the laser dot at Andrea. "I mean, your wife is pretty, I'll give her that, and she at least seems fit, which is good. But let's examine the important things. Let's start right here," she said, shining the laser dot at Andrea's chest. "Let's talk about your wife's breasts, Paul. Does it bother you that your wife is as flat as a board?" 

"Tori..." I warned, my blood boiling, but she loved it. She was loving the anger she was causing me. 

"Ooh, I hit a sore spot, it seems. I'm sorry, but all girls compare cup sizes. I didn't realize it was a touchy subject to you. So, it bothers you how small and pathetic your wife's breasts are?" Tori asked casually. 

"Tori!" I called out again, losing my cool. "Don't talk about my wife." 

"But Paul, that's all I'm gonna be talking about, so please, calm down," she said, slightly shaking her breasts side-to-side, emphasizing their size as she seemingly tried to cool my anger with the sight of her bouncing boobs. "I know the truth can be tough to hear, but we all know it. It's a fact. Andrea has itty bitty titties. They're mosquito bites. I mean, all the women in the office like her, but we all can't believe how tiny her little titties are. We all can't believe you settled down with a woman with breasts so small, when you easily could have been with a girl with tits so much bigger. C'mon, Paul, you have to admit your wife's tits are, like, crazy small," she contested, stealthily unbuttoning another button on her top, allowing more of her copious breast flesh to become visible. 

"I love my wife's chest just fine." I said, looking away, wanting to change the subject. As I said before, a girl's cup size doesn't change my feelings on her. The foundation of a sturdy relationship is based on stronger things than that. I mean, all things the same, would I mind if she had bigger breasts? Of course not. But honestly, Andrea is perfect the way she is. 

"Just fine, huh? Not a really strong endorsement." Tori said. "Now, look at mine." I just looked her in the eyes, not wanting to play along. "C'mon Paul, the sooner you do, the sooner this ends. The sooner your eyes are hungrily gazing on the smooth, hot, sexy flesh of my giant breasts, the sooner we can move on." I held her gaze, resisting her invitation. "Fine. You can look at the real thing, or the picture, either choice is fine." I lazily shifted my glance back to the picture, where Tori was shining the laser at her own pictured, jutting chest. "Look at my tits, Paul. So big...so soft...so perfect...34 EE's, baby, and they are all real. Just imagine squeezing them, playing with them... the softness is addicting, you'll never get enough," she said, her tone low and lusty as she moved closer to my desk, leaning over it again. "Have you ever thought about squeezing my tits, Paul?" she asked, shaking her tits slightly, trying to get me to look at her exposed cleavage. I glanced at her in the eyes, the look in my eyes voicing my displeasure. "I bet you have. I mean, me and Andrea, together, it really showcases the differences between us. Your wife is all flat and dull, but I have all these luscious curves. My tits... my ass," she said, turning slightly to point her butt at me. "She's pretty. I'm hot. She's classy, I'm dirty. She's a wife... I'm a slut." 

"All men need a slut, Paul. Especially men in power. They work so hard and do so much good, every so often, they just need to vent all that stress somewhere. I'm sure all the big bosses you idolize have sluts like me too. Men like you... they need to do all the sick, disgusting, hot things they could never do with their wives. Things they couldn't possibly do to a woman they respect. That's why women like me exist, Paul. That's the role we play. All men have these needs, and women like me can provide them," she affirmed, pausing for a moment, clasping her hands together.  

===

"You are out there, Tori." I said, shaking my head at her insanity. She just smirked. 

"Now, I can tell you things about your wife that only you know. Things that only sluts like me can see. For example, Andrea strikes me as being a bit... precious... in bed. I bet she makes you do all the work. Sure, she buys some lingerie that she thinks is fancy, but it's actually pretty cheap and unflattering. I bet she whispers adorable dirty talk, talks to you in between the sheets, lies back, spreads her legs, and lets you do your thing. She doesn't talk, she just moans cutely in your ear. She clutches you tight as you take care of her needs, and sure, you feel the love, but it's not love that makes a guy's balls boil. You don't know enough to know that what she's giving you is the beginner stuff, and you're too nice to ask for the good stuff. You both are practically begging for a slut like me to swoop in and show you what real fucking is all about," she finished, gesturing her arm as she did so, brushing it against her jutting rack. I bet those huge breasts got in the way a lot... wait, what am I thinking? 

"You don't know what you're talking about," I replied, not letting myself think about her words too much. 

"Well, I think you're lying, and I can prove it. Because I've done my research, and I know exactly what type of woman Andrea is." Tori affirmed. She advanced the slide show. When a picture popped, my eyes widened in genuine shock. 

"This is the contents of your wife's underwear drawer," she said. Projected across from me was my wife's underwear, strewn neatly across my marital bed. 

"You broke into my house!?" I said loudly. 

"I didn't technically break in," she replied, shrugging her shoulders. "I can be quite convincing, and your housekeeper isn't exactly the brightest of the bunch. I told her that me and Andrea were total besties, and I wanted to check and see if she had this purse I was getting for her. Not the best lie in the world, but Rosa bought it, so, yeah..." 

I shook my head, gawking in shock. Tori had been in my house, my bedroom? She was insane! 

"So, as I was saying, this is all your wife's underwear," she resumed, taking advantage of my silence, acting as if this was totally normal. "And I must say, I am not impressed. I mean, not a single thong in the bunch. No thongs, no g- strings, what is this, the 50's?" On the screen was picture after picture of my wife's underwear, nothing skimpy. She wasn't that type of girl. All of it was full-coverage, covering her butt. Some of it was more practical, stuff she wore to work, simple, utilitarian undergarments. She did have some more sexy stuff, a few lace bras and panties, some sexy nighties and camisoles, stuff like that. But, looking at all of this laid out like this, I suppose I could see the argument she was making. I suppose one could say this stuff was a bit on the plain side, but I was never one to complain. "Now, here is a real woman's underwear." 

She changed the slide, and my eyes widened. The same shot she had taken of my wife's underwear strewn across my bed was replicated, no doubt on her own bed. And while my bed was a classy soft beige color, this bed was black satin and an expensive looking red sheet. The contrast was striking. It was clear my bed was designed to hold a happy, content couple, and Tori's... her bed was used for fun. On the bed were tiny bits of fabric, thin and lacy and all different colors. The last things these garments were designed for was practicality. They were designed to highlight the wearer. I couldn't help but take in all the bras and thongs and G-strings on the bed. Did thongs really come that small? And some of the stuff there, I had no idea how a person could wear it. 

"This is the contents of my underwear drawer, but honestly, most modern sluts nowadays would have similar things. A girl's gotta be committed to looking hot 24/7, because for women like me, sex can happen at any time. Like last weekend, I was at this restaurant with some friends, and this guy, while sitting next to his wife and kids, could not take his eyes off my tits. I mean, yeah, I admit, the top I was wearing made me look like a total slut, but this was a married man. He should know better, right?" she said, giving me a knowing smirk. "I give him the look and the nod, and while his wife cleaned up after the rugrats, mister nice, married man was railing my tight cunt in the bathroom. So that was nice. And then, oh yeah, like, the week before, me and some of my friends were at the bar, and my friend's older sister was just drinking me in with her eyes all fucking night. And this chick was, like, the hottest lesbian I've ever seen. I don't think my friend knew her older sister was into chicks, and, who knows, maybe she wasn't and my hot body was enough to make her switch teams, but I could tell immediately she wanted a piece of my ass. That whole night, she had her hands all over me. When no one could see, she had her hand on my ass, squeezing it like she couldn't get enough. She slid her hand down my skirt, fingering me, keeping me dripping wet all fucking night. And whenever she could, she would find some excuse to put her hands on my big tits. I didn't have to do anything, my hot body was enough to make this super-hot chick just fucking drool over me. When she offered to give me a ride home, I knew exactly what the ride would entail. Needless to say, minutes later, me and her were in the backseat, pulled over in some parking lot somewhere. She had pulled my thong to the side and she was rimming my ass. And when she got at my pussy...God, that girl made me gush," she trailed off in a warm silence, letting that heated scene linger, slyly popping undone another button on her top. 

I didn't know what to say to that. I mean, yeah, it sounded like a very, uh... sexually charged scene, but I couldn't let that affect me. I couldn't let my mind go down that road. 

"So, you see, for a chick like me, with a body like mine, sex can happen at any time, with anyone. I'm the type of girl that guys throw their vows away for. I'm the type of girl that women get hot for, no matter how much they fucking hate me. And also note, that even though I will be your assistant, that appeal won't go away. Guys will be jealous that you have this hot piece of ass as your assistant, and they will respect the fact that you've locked this down. And other chicks, they'll want a piece of the pie. They'll want a piece of you, or a piece of me. So, hiring me isn't just bringing me into your bed. It's bringing all sorts of dirty sluts in too. I'm your ticket to a future full of filthy sex. Doesn't that sound exciting?" she asked with a wide smile, her top now undone to the point of showing off part of her fit belly. Her excitement was clearly one-sided. 

"This is what a man like you needs from an assistant," she stated. "Booty. Copious amounts of top-shelf ass. These are things I can provide that no one else can. This is what being a good assistant entails." 

"Edwin... he was a great assistant." I pointed out. "He was someone who did the type of work I respect. He did the type of work that gets you places." This argument didn't affect her. In fact, it made her smile in such a smug manner that it made a bolt of concern shoot through me. 

"Do you really want to know why Edwin left?" she asked, with a twinkle in her eye. 

"He got a job offer at a good company who recognized his good work, and he took it," I said, confused as to what she was leading to. She rolled her eyes at my response. 

"Edwin left because I fucked his brains out at the company cookout, and after he confessed to his wife, like an idiot, she made him vow to move across the country, away from me. So you can't hold him up as this paragon of virtue, cause he was just like all the rest, just wanting a piece of Tori K's ass," she replied smugly, making sure to point her butt at me as she did so. I was floored by this. I remembered his wedding day quite well. He loved his wife so much, and she loved him. There was no way he cheated on her. No way. 

"That's... that's not true, he... he... he's married, and his wife..." I stammered, completely caught off guard. She turned her back to me and... 

SMACK! 

My stuttering was interrupted by Tori smacking her own ass crisply, and the bouncing of her firm ass-cheek stole my attention, and the words from my mouth. 

"None of that mattered compared to this," she said, proudly shaking her ass at me. She turned back to face me. "And these..." she said, cupping her hands under her huge breasts. "His new job pays, like, way less than this one, has way less benefits, and less room to move up. All because his pathetic fucking guilt prevented him from keeping his mouth shut. Eh, it's not that big a deal for me, anyway. He wasn't that good of a fuck." I shook my head, not believing this. I knew Edwin, he wouldn't cheat on his wife... right? 

"No, no, he left because he got a good job offer, a better position," I began. 

"Paul, he lied to you to save face. His new job is much worse, trust me." She approached my desk slowly, confidently. "Everyone lets you down in the end, Paul. All these perfect people have their sins. Have their dark sides. You're no different. All those life lessons you taught him fell aside when he was in close proximity to these tits," she said, shaking her breasts, again using her body to lure my reluctant gaze. I pulled my attention away, shaking my head, hoping she was lying, but deep down having a nagging suspicion that she might be telling the truth. 

At this point, I wanted nothing more than to extricate myself from this incredibly awkward situation, but I knew deep down, if I tried to simply kick her out or try to end this decisively, she would take this whole thing to another level. This Edwin thing, it had wounded me, and I feared what other secrets she could bust out if I kept trying to push her away. Unfortunately, the safest play might just be to let this play out and keep everything at a level I could handle. 

I tried not to think about why I kept letting this circus continue, why I was finding reasons to not just call security. Why I kept letting Tori stay in this office and keep going with this brazen seduction. For some reason, maybe cause I was still in shock over the Edwin thing, I didn't try to stop her here. I just let her continue. 

She gestured at the screen, forcing my attention back to her presentation. Back to her bed, covered with her thin, lacy underthings. For some reason, this one red thong caught my attention. It was tiny, and lacy, with just enough material to cover her nether regions, but gosh, I just don't see how it could cover anything. The thong was so small, and the lace was so thin... even if it covered her, you would no doubt be able to see EVERYTHING. I bet she looked amazing wearing some of those. They would really highlight her many curves. And the little red strings of the thong were so tiny... the middle string would just disappear between her... no, NO. Stop thinking about this stuff, I told myself. I shook myself out of my revere, hoping she didn't notice my momentary interest in her underwear. She didn't hesitate, ready to continue her presentation. 

"This is my resume, Paul. This is the clearest illustration of my many talents. This picture is the most plain argument I can possibly make about why I belong in the corporate world." I didn't even try to understand her logic. I was silent and I just let her continue. "But as we all know, great clothing is only as great as the person who wears them. So..." She clicked forward to the next slide, and what appeared there really shocked me. 

It was pictures of my wife in her underwear. 

"What the hell?" I asked, unable to contain my shock. She simply smiled that Cheshire cat grin of hers, filling me with anger. There were two pictures of Andrea, one from the front and one from the back. They appeared to be taken from the bathroom she used, after her shower. "How did you get this?" I asked. 

"I did my research," she replied calmly. "When I was in your house, I was pretty busy. It's not too complicated to put a spy cam in your wife's bathroom. I just hid it in there, went back the next day when no one was around to pick it up." 

"Wait, how did you get in?" I asked, the first of a million questions I had. 

"I took a set of keys, silly," she replied, as if the answer was obvious. 

"You have keys to my house!?" I asked, incredulous. 

"Well, if I'm gonna be your assistant, I need full access to every aspect of your life. Your house, your car, your bank accounts, everything," she replied, nipples throbbing underneath her top. I was too shocked to form a reply, so she used the silence to continue. 

"But don't worry, I didn't take any naked pictures of you. I wanted to save my prize for when I had earned it," Tori stated. "That moment when you willingly unzip your pants and scoop out that fat, rock-hard married dick for me... that moment is too delicious to waste." She paused, her finger grazing over her protruding nipple, clearly enjoying these thoughts. I didn't know what to say, and my eyes slid back to the pictures of my wife. 

"So, in my computer, I labeled these pictures 'The Disaster Zone', for obvious reasons," she began. "I mean, just look at this." In the pictures, it seemed like my wife was getting ready for the day in the bathroom. She wore a plain, gray cotton bra and panties, nothing too fancy, but certainly economical and practical. She would wear this to work, but it wasn't like this would be the type of thing she would wear for me in the bedroom. She did have some slightly fancier stuff. Nothing like those ridiculous thongs that Tori seemed to prefer, but stuff that was, you know... nice. 

"This stuff is just disgusting!" Tori stated. "I mean, she is wearing unflattering underwear on a really unimpressive body. She is literally curveless! Her butt is flat and dull and gross, and, just look, her panties are just big and bulky and baggy, hanging off her nasty ass." The picture certainly wasn't flattering to my wife. I could immediately tell that where the camera was hidden, in a plant on top of the cupboard. It was pointed at my wife as she looked in the mirror. She was brushing her teeth, standing in front of the mirror as she got cleaned up. The material of the cotton panties sagged a bit around her butt, not hugging her body. Some would call these 'granny panties', but I wasn't the type of guy to be bothered by this type of thing. "And then, look at her bra! Ugh!" Tori spat out. I looked at the other picture, of Andrea facing the camera, putting her bra-covered chest on display. 

My wife wasn't overly busty or anything like that. Her breasts were petite, but again, I wasn't the type of guy to be bothered by this type of thing. The bra covered most of her breasts, containing her small breasts. The gray garment was practical, not built to impress. 

"Your wife has itty bitty titties and they STILL sag!" Tori remarked. My wife wasn't completely flat, I mean, she certainly had boobs, but they weren't exactly perky and fleshy. They weren't bad. They were enough for me. But to Tori, anything less than perky, fat, fleshy EE's were a disappointment. "Your wife has these sad little mosquito bites. I mean, it's as if her body didn't even try. And she does herself no favors with that cheap bra." 

"She's a kindergarten teacher! Why would she dress up?" I asked, angry. 

"No excuse." Tori affirmed. "I was wearing a g-string at my niece's baptism, and I ended up making out with the fucking priest." I shook my head at how off- hand she made this boast. "Some women are willing to go the extra-mile at every minute of the day, and some women, like Andrea, only try when they have to. A girl always has to be ready, cause when those moments come, you have to be ready. That is the kind of devotion you can expect from me. The only time a thong won't be nestled between my butt-cheeks is when you rip it off of me." She paused for a moment, letting that sink in. "Now, let me show you something that I think you need to see." Tori said, pausing, smirking slightly before clicking the presentation forward. 

The pictures on the screen were replaced by ones of Tori, in the same bathroom, wearing the same underwear. 

The picture on the right showed off Tori in my wife's bra, standing in front of my wife's mirror, making a kissy face as she took a selfie. But, where it covered most of Andrea's breasts, it struggled to contain Tori's prodigious jugs. They jutted out, straining the material, the flesh overflowing the material. This was a garment meant to be practical, but Tori somehow made it look indecent. 

The other picture was a picture of Tori's butt. And, where the cotton material hung off my wife's butt, the material clung to Tori's round, jutting ass. The firm cheeks were seemingly bursting to escape the undergarment, parts of the bottom of them bared in the picture, as the material was seemingly sucked between them. This garment covered Andrea's butt and nothing more, but it showcased Tori's rear end. 

"What the..." I began. 

"I know. I couldn't help myself." Tori said. "It was tough to force those disgusting things onto my body, but I had to prove the point. Even in plain, ugly, cheap clothes, I still look awesome. I can look sexy without even trying. Your wife can barely pass as sexy when she is trying. But, although I look good, even in your wife's cheap underwear, my body is not really being showcased. Now, let me show you a picture of a woman who puts in the effort. Let me show you works every day to look good. A woman who can work a full-time job and still look sexy." She advanced the presentation, and the two pictures were replaced with one. 

My breath caught in my throat. 

I was now staring at a picture Tori's thong-clad ass. 

It was framed perfectly in the center of the picture, clearly taken in my wife's bathroom. It was evident that she took her time with this image, making sure her butt was being shown off perfectly. And it was. The cheeks were firm and round, standing out clearly from her slim body. Each of them were just perfectly shaped, round and smooth and firm. Her skin was evenly tanned, the smooth, silky flesh of her ass making it look even better. The creases between her ass and her legs were almost artfully smooth. The way her butt emerged from her lean, tight back really highlighted its lusciousness. And the way the two cheeks curved inward where they pressed together, forming the cleft of her ass- crack, was just visually striking. 

Her firm ass-cheeks were round and full enough to engulf the string of her miniscule thong in her deep ass-crack, the tiny material disappearing between the fleshy mounds. The thin black, lacy thong showcased her mouthwatering rear- end perfectly, framing it, showcasing its shape. The thin material dug in slightly into her smooth flesh lightly, the small straps of the tiny thong drawn tightly against her body. The straps hugged the upper edge of her butt cheeks, meeting at the triangle of material at the cleft of her ass-crack. And above the thong was her tramp stamp, a tattoo of some green, thorny vines, roses bursting out from it. The tattoo not out of place on the image she was presenting. 

"Look at that ass," Tori gasped quietly from my right, startling me as she stood over the side of the table, closer than I thought she was. "It's amazing, isn't it? That, right there, is a corporate ass. That's the kind of ass that's built for the boardroom. That butt is meant to be in business skirts. All good businesses have a butt like that stashed away somewhere." 

My vision was arrested. It was an amazing ass, I couldn't deny that. And judging by her posture and the way I had seen the firm cheeks bounce and jiggle, she knew exactly how to use it to her advantage. She knew how to make a man crawl behind her, looking for a glimpse. I am positive she had used it to her advantage in the office, distracting some hard working man as he tried to do his job, making it a point to strut by his cubicle, stealing his attention, his gaze. He would try to look away and focus on his work, or his wife back home, but he wouldn't be able to stop thinking about those round cheeks, watching them jiggle. The sight would be so sexy he would be drooling. He would become obsessed with that ass, not being able to think about anything else until he just had to see it. And when he came crawling, he would offer up anything to see it. And when he did, and he experienced everything that butt could do first-hand, he would be broken forever. He would not be the same man again. He would be corrupted, both professionally and personally. And in this fantasy, I couldn't help but think that this man... was me.  

===

No... no, NO! Paul, stop it! You are not one of these guys! Quit it! 

Only after studying every inch of her rear end for a few silent moments did I realize what I was doing. I blinked a few times, trying to clear the image that was now burned onto my retinas. I looked at her, only seeing a small smirk pass across her plump lips. She walked away from the desk, shaking her butt as she walked, highlighting the rump hidden beneath the tight, molded skirt. She kept her butt facing me, smoothing down her skirt over it as she continued. God, I'd love to see it bare... no. STOP! 

My brain was in chaos. All rational thought told me how wrong I was for gawking, but she wasn't speaking to my rational mind. She was speaking to my male instincts. The deep part of my brain that was controlled by pure lust. And that side of me... it was loving what it was seeing. I just had to control myself, stamp it out, not let myself get lost like so many already had before. 

"This is what it looks like when a woman combines her natural gifts with hard work. An ass like this should be treated like the work of art it is. This ass should be a showcase to the type of dedication I will bring to this job," she affirmed. "It has many admirers, many satisfied customers, but if you hire me, you gain excusive ownership of Tori K's juicy booty. You can do anything you'd like to it. You can spank it, you can squeeze it, you can fuck it, you can eat it..." 

"Eat it...?" I repeated, the mere thought of it sounding foreign to me. 

"Yes, I've been told my asshole is quite tasty," she responded deftly, not acknowledging my discomfort before continuing. "So, I mean, you would really be a fool to let an ass like mine get away." 

"But, I'm more than just a hot ass. A lot more, cause I've got it going on everywhere, as I'm sure you've noticed." She advanced the slides on her presentation. The next picture showed a picture of her legs, encased in some smooth, black stockings. "I have some amazing, long legs. So firm... so sexy... I bet all you're thinking about is feeling them wrapped around you," she boasted, raising her eyebrow. I was holding myself in check, not letting my brain get carried away. I wasn't giving her any reaction at this point, my anger and embarrassment almost ready to boil over. I just held her gaze, and my obvious annoyance caused her to smile. She advanced the slide, showing off those long, firm legs spread apart lewdly, as she sat on the edge of what was clearly my bed, another one of the things she did after sneaking in. This picture highlighted the black lace thong barely covering her nether-regions. 

"I'm not gonna lie... I have, like, the best cunt. It's amazing! It's so small, and cute, and always shaved. And you know, despite the fact that I'm the office skank, my pussy is still, like, crazy tight. You wouldn't believe how tight is! Like, as soon as a cock is balls deep inside me, my pussy squeezes it HARD and just never wants to let go. It squeezes every inch of a fat, meaty cock, juices that fucker up, and makes sure it fucking explodes in, like, the best orgasm ever!" she boasted. I'd never heard anyone talk like this before, and I have to admit it sent a jolt of fear through me. I tried not to let her penetrate my brain, but I couldn't help but help but think about what it would be like to feel her hot, tight, wet... Stop it Paul! No! 

I was slightly panicking. I wanted nothing more than for this madness to just be over, but before I could do anything, she continued. She clearly wasn't done. She advanced the slide again, showing a close-up of her plump, smooth, glossy lips, her sweet tongue sliding across them. 

"I also have the sexiest fucking mouth," she boasted, licking her lips in front of me. "I have the plumpest, sexiest lips, which I like to keep glossed up and perfect looking at every moment. You have no idea how good my mouth is until you feel it wrapped around your fat, married cock! My soft, smooth lips, wrapped tightly around your meaty shaft. My firm, sexy tongue, going wild on your tasty shaft, not letting up until you just fucking explode! My sexy, tight throat, which can take just about any cock down to the balls. Believe me when I tell you this, Paul, in few minutes your swollen balls WILL be bouncing off my chin. I can't wait!" I have to admit, this image she conjured did jump into my mind. It must just be the fact that I was so on edge after having gone so long without relief, but the image of me, standing over Tori, who's on her knees in front of me, clad in a sexy business suit, looking up at me as my penis slid into her mouth roughly, saliva leaking from her mouth as I drove into her, as her gaze held mine, clearly telling me she was hungry for more. I looked away from her for a moment, not wanting to betray my steely veneer, not wanting to let her know that she was getting to me. 

When I finally looked back at her, I met her eyes, eyes that were beaming with pride. She stood in profile to me, letting me gaze over her luscious curves. I thought over what she was doing, not believing that I was seeing someone seriously make the argument that they should be given a job solely on the basis of their hot body. There was no shame on her face. No hesitance in her actions. No sign in the least that this was some huge joke on her part. She had a plan, but she wasn't done yet. Far from it. She had used many weapons, but not the big ones, not really. She was clearly holding back, and deep down, I knew it was now time to bring the big guns more into play. 

She spun on her heel, turning to face me fully, revealing the fact that her top was now completely unbuttoned and spread apart, exposing her large, bra-clad breasts. And her spinning motion caused those massive jugs to bounce, the smooth, silky flesh jiggling, desperate to burst from within their lacy constraints. The red lace bra was digging into her skin, struggling to contain those massive, soft boobs as they practically oozed out from them. They bounced and jiggled, taking a few moments to settle down after she finished her little spin. And as she did this motion, she advanced to the next picture on her presentation, really making sure I understood what the next part of her presentation would center on. 

Tits. 

Tori K's tits were blown up on the far wall, an enlarged version of the vision I was seeing in front of me. The picture showed her tits barely contained in a black bra, similar in style to the red one she was wearing now. She was using her arms to force her fleshy tits outward, causing the bra to seem strained to the point of bursting. Her hard nipples were evident beneath the lace, jutting out, gagging for appreciation, and a warm, wet mouth. 

"I can't even pretend to be humble," Tori began, as if she had actually been in any way humble up to this point. "I LOVE my tits! They are my favorite features, and with a hot body like mine, that's saying something. They're just so big... and soft..." she gasped out softly, running her hands up her chest, squeezing her bra-clad breasts between her fingers, the perky flesh filling her hands, threatening to pour over the edges of the lace material of her red bra. "I love playing with them. Squeezing them. Having them touched by a pair of loving, appreciative hands. Sucked by an eager mouth. Having my nipples bit with that perfect level of firmness. Hmmmm..." she shivered, goose bumps rising on her skin as hesitantly pulled her hands off of herself. "Needless to say, having my breasts played with is usually enough to get me off. And... when a man gets his hands on these," she began, sauntering towards me, her fleshy boobs jiggling with every step. "...or his mouth" she whispered, leaning over the desk, her huge breasts hanging down, her weighty boobs jiggling, their immense size again threatening the tensile strength of her lace bra, "or when he just dives in face-first and just drowns in softness... it's enough to make any man just fucking explode! And they can be yours. All yours! You can squeeze them, slap them, suck them, fuck them. You can pull out your fat dick and cover them with hot, thick cum! You can do whatever you want, whenever you want, cause they will be yours! And I guarantee these fucking jugs will give you more pleasure and more happiness than anything that sweet, little Miss Andrea can give you! And when you finally get your hands on these udders... mmm, it'll be better than your fucking wedding night! I guarantee it." she affirmed. She stood straight up, her boobs bouncing with this motion, before she smoothed out her skirt over her thighs. 

If her ass could do damage, her breasts could destroy worlds. Those were her biggest weapons, and she knew it. I know she used those suckers at work at every opportunity. For something as simple as asking her boss for a few days off, showing her cavernous cleavage, making him much more agreeable. She also used them for far more nefarious purposes, wearing indecently low-cut tops, showing off the luscious curves packed into her blouse, teasing her target with the soft fleshy delights contained within, and the promise of seeing them bare in exchange for giving her the promotion she wanted. 

I couldn't stop myself from imagining myself seeing them bare. I couldn't help myself, it would be impossible not to. I could only hope that I would react in the way I told myself I would, rejecting her, but I couldn't help but think I would have the same reaction so many others did. I would drool over them. They would render me speechless. I would want to dive in face-first in worship, to gratefully become one of the many men who fallen to their knees before her, a submission that would no doubt be amazing. I would want to get my hands on those big, soft jugs and go to town. I would open my mouth to take... 

I shook my head again, trying to erase these stray thoughts. This had to end. I had to be done with this. 

"So, I think I've made a pretty clear case as to why I'm not just the best candidate for the job, but the only one," she said, carrying on again as if this was a normal presentation despite the fact that her bra-clad breasts were hanging out, bouncing lusciously with every little movement she made. "I'm beautiful, better looking than all the other candidates, AND especially your wife, and a man in your position deserves and needs to be surrounded by the best. Plus, I have that kind of beauty and sexiness that lets everyone know that I'm totally game to get down in the dirtiest ways imaginable. This body should make my case for me as to why this job should mine. This is a body that deserves to be among the elite. This is a corporate body, and it should be treated as such. Not only does this body belong in corporate, I do as well. I can be the tough, ruthless, cutthroat bitch a guy like you needs. You've done well, but with me by your side, you can do so much more. You do business the dull way, the honest way, but me... I know how to play dirty. There's a reason someone like me has risen so high. I know what really motivates people. I know how to destroy your rivals, and these are all things I can teach you. Me and you belong together. We're yin and yang. A perfect match. And, if it's not obvious by now, I know how to care for a man, better than your wife has ever done. I'm a better fit for you than her, by a long shot. You don't believe me? Most people have references, I have a little black book. Ask around, and you will find that I probably haven't given myself enough credit for how good I am. So, I'm the hottest candidate, the sexiest candidate, I have the best body, and the biggest tits! And I can fuck whenever you want, wherever you want, and however you want, so it would appear then that... I'm the perfect candidate," she smiled brilliantly at me, flashing her pearly whites. She then pulled back the chair she had been in at the start and sat down, disobediently bringing her smooth legs up onto the table, crossing them in front of me, her high heels pointing at me. "So... when do I start?" she asked confidently, letting the question hang. 

In this motion, she had clicked forward to the last side of her presentation. There were two pictures, next to each other. One was of my wife, again in her underwear, smiling at herself in the mirror, happy with the image she was presenting, her slim body still clad in her frumpy underwear. Next to this picture was one of Tori, also in my wife's underwear, her luscious body barely contained by the garments. She had a smirk on her face, as if she knew that she had her competition beat. Knowing she was superior to the woman next to her in every way. Her huge, soft, mammoth jugs overflowing the cotton bra, the pressure they were exerting nearly shredding it. Her rock hard nipples were pointing outward beneath the garment, as if she loved showing off other women's inferiority. On one side, my wife, looking cute in her practical underwear. On the other side was Tori, eyes glimmering with dark intentions, he lips curled wickedly, her body rocking the shit out of a bra and panties that weren't meant to look sexy. On Tori, they looked indecent. 

It was as if Tori wanted to drive home one more time that she had my wife beaten in every category. Looks, body, sex appeal. And if these things were the only thing that mattered, she was surely the victor. 

But she wasn't. 

I looked at her, sitting there so confident, so convinced that she had won. The smug look on her face was almost enough to just make you want to put her in her place, but her smooth, sexy breasts, just bursting from her slim body, barely contained by her bra, was enough to take a step back. She thought she had me beat. She had me sitting in silence as she carried out this madness, convinced she had worn me down enough to have broken me. Sure, she was certainly sexy, there was no denying that. And... there had been moments of weakness on my part, but I wasn't so easily conquered. There was a reason I had done so well in this company. If I couldn't handle a tough negotiation, I wouldn't be here. And I always did my best when pushed into a corner. I had negotiated with some of the toughest negotiators in the world and survived. 

I could handle Tori K. 

I stood up, straightened my suit coat, and glanced out the window, taking in the later afternoon sun shining over the various buildings. After taking in her offer, I made my reply. 

"Well, first of all, you're fired." I began, and this moment of seeming rejection only made her smile. "I can lay out the various reasons why. Sexual harassment. Inappropriate behavior in the workplace. Whatever. But needless to say, today is your last day. The way you've conducted yourself today was enough to talk your way out of a pretty good job, but I think we both know you were probably underqualified for that job anyway." I stated, causing her to sigh in mock offense. "You need to understand that using your body and your looks can only get you so far, that in the end, what matters is what's inside, your personality, your work ethic..." I stated firmly, but she only rolled her eyes, as if I was dreadfully naïve. "Looks fade, but work ethic lasts. What takes you places is hard work, being a good person, and doing things right." 

"Ha!" she barked with laughter. I walked around my desk. 

"I know it sounds trite, but it's what's gotten me here." I began. "You're not gonna get any job worth having just by throwing yourself at people, using your body. Success doesn't happen like that. You're not stupid, Tori, but you need to change if you want a job like this." Her eyes were lazily drifting from me, as if barely listening to my lecture. And finally, after going this madness for too long, I finally lost my cool. 

"TORI!" I called out, slamming my fist onto the table, causing her to jump, her eyes landing back on me, her eyes wide. 

"Oh my God!" she sighed, staring at me. "You have no idea how turned on I am right now. I LOVE seeing you angry." I laughed to myself a bit as I tried to hold my tongue. Finally, I calmed myself and continued. 

"The worst thing..." I paused, knocking my knuckles on the desk. "The worst thing you did was disparage my wife. That, I cannot abide. In what universe do you think saying awful things like that would convince me to like you? In what way does showing how rude and nasty you really are make me want to hire you? You have a lot to learn, Tori. A lot. About how business is actually done, and how professionals carry themselves. Your looks, the size of your breasts, your ass... none of these things matter as much as you think." Tori rolled her eyes again. "You need to learn how to respect other people, but most of all, you need to learn how to respect yourself." She couldn't contain her laughter, her breasts bouncing as she did so. I was undeterred. 

"Throwing yourself at men to get ahead, calling yourself a slut... Tori, you need to solve your own issues before taking them out on others. You're not happy with the life you have, you see the worst in yourself, and therefore you see the worst in others. The whole basis of your argument as to why I should hire you is that you are attracted to me, and you secretly think I'm attracted to you, because your convinced that someone like me has this... 'secret dark side'. You assume the only reason someone could like you is if they are not actually a good person, but maybe you can't believe the fact that, after spending your life seducing men who would have you, or going to nightclubs and picking up men there, maybe you found yourself unsatisfied. Maybe you wanted more. Maybe you just can't believe that you would actually be attracted to a good, decent guy." She was taken aback by this argument, but she stammered over her words a bit, not being able to find a reply. She looked down slightly. For the first time, I felt like I struck a nerve. I think I finally got through to her about how wrong she was. I felt confident about that. (Hey, like I said, I'm pretty good at negotiating.) I looked down at her, again noting her state of undress, her big creamy, smooth, soft breasts hanging out, clad in her lacy red bra. I looked away, suddenly paranoid that someone would stumble on this situation and draw the wrong conclusion. It was time to put an end to this. I started moving towards the door. 

"Okay, Tori, it's time for this farce to end. Cover yourself up, gather your things, and leave. We can gather up the contents of your desk. You can pick them up at the front desk on Monday. Go home, Tori, and really think about what happened today, how wrong you were, and maybe, just maybe, you can learn something." I paused, putting my hand on the doorknob, looking back at her, expecting her to be packing her things, finally admitting defeat. 

I was wrong. I was so wrong. 

She was bent over the desk, her back to me, her skirt clinging to her rear end. She looked back at me, and any thoughts that I had gotten through to her disappeared upon seeing the smirk on her face. 

"Oh, this isn't over yet," Tori boasted. "Let's see if this changes your mind." With that, she reached back, and pulled her skirt up, sliding the taut material up until, finally, her round ass emerged, bared to my eyes. Her skirt was now bunched up around her waist, allowing her ass to be displayed fully, but it wasn't completely exposed. My eyes didn't settle on the firm, round, jutting cheeks. It settled in between, on the tiny red thong splitting the cheeks. It was the same red thong that had caught my eye earlier when her underwear was laid out on her bed, and now, I was seeing it in action, used in the way it was meant to, tucked between her beautiful round ass-cheeks. I studied the delightful way the tiny string disappeared between the cheeks. It was the first time I had seen a thong on a girl in real life, and I was momentarily transfixed. In my stupor, my hand slipped from the doorknob.  

===

"This is one of the many positions you'll find me on daily basis when you hire me," Tori said, undeterred from her mission. She reached behind herself, slapping her ass, causing the right cheek to jiggle. She then bent over the desk even further, resting on her breasts so she could reach behind herself, pulling her ass-cheeks apart, exposing the full cleft of her ass-crack. I could see the entire length of the string of her thong, and behind it, barely hidden, was her bare, exposed asshole. My momentary stupor was shaken, and I was filled with a sudden panic. This needed to end, now. 

"Tori! Please... just leave! Cover yourself up and leave. Don't make me call security." I began. "Because I will, and then..." 

SMACK! 

She slapped her ass firmly, and my anger soon disappeared as I watched the now bare, round, smooth ass-cheek ripple with the force of the spank. My words left my mouth at this delicious sight, my anger temporarily forgotten. 

"Uh, Tori, put your clothes on, and leave," I told her, with not quite as much anger. I shook my head, looking away, wanting this to just be done. I rested my hand on the doorknob again, pausing, waiting for her to put her clothes back on so I could just open the door without fear of being caught. 

I would not be so lucky. 

She released her grip on her own ass and pushed herself up, her butt jiggling mouth-wateringly again as she stood. She turned back to face me, pushed herself upward, and rested her round ass against the table. With a firm pull, she yanked down her skirt over her hips, letting it fall to the floor. Her red-lace covered crotch was now exposed to me, and then, as she pushed herself back to fully sit on the table, she spread her legs apart lewdly, running her fingers down over her covered pussy. The thong underwear was tiny, and it barely covered her nether regions, and it confirmed her earlier boast. If she had any sort of landing strip or anything like that, with as little as the thong covered, that hair would be visible. No, Tori K was completely shaved. 

Tori leaned back onto the desk, resting on her elbows, bringing her high-heel clad feet up onto the wood, keeping them spread apart, the tiny material molding over her nearly exposed vagina. With her top splayed open, her bra-clad breasts were jutting out, bouncing around as she made this movement. All signs of the professional woman she had been acting as was now gone, now looking every bit the slut she boasted to be. 

"Tori... this needs to stop!" I pled with her. 

"Face it Paul... we're not leaving this office without having sex. That's been true from the moment I walked in here. That's how this ends, and you've known that from the start. The minute I came in here shaking my hot ass and huge tits, you knew we would be getting all hot and sweaty. I would be teaching you exactly how business should be done. So relax, take off your clothes, get comfortable. I'm ready for you," she said, sliding her hand down, rubbing her thong covered crotch between her fingers. A silence fell as I tried to figure out a plan, a small moan of pleasure coming from her direction. This exposure from her was causing me pause, but as I thought about it, I realized that no matter what I said, she wasn't walking out of here without getting what she wanted. I really only had one choice. 

I guess she pushed me to this. 

I reached into my pocket and pulled out my cell phone. 

"Mmm, what are you doing?" she asked, still rubbing herself. "Taking a picture?" she inquired confidently. 

"No..." I replied. "I'm calling security." I said simply, skimming through my contacts. 

"Why do that?" she asked innocently. "I can tell you like what you see," she said, glancing down to my crotch. I was pulled away from my task at this, following her gaze to the now prominent bulge in my pants pushing outward. Apparently, despite my brain knowing better, my dick was loving what Tori was doing. No... it couldn't be. 

"No, it's just..." I stammered, straightening my pants over myself and bending in slightly, trying to hide my bulge from her hungry eyes. As I did this, an explanation came to mind that would explain this off. "No, I'm meeting my wife after work, and... it's been about a week for us." Yeah, I was hard for my wife, eager to meet her for our romantic weekend together, and not for this half-dressed, illicit, scheming seductress in my office. I am so NOT attracted to women like Tori, not now, not ever. 

"Oh, okay, that makes sense," Tori responded with a condescending smile, clearly not believing me, nodding her head as she rubbed herself. I shook my head, not knowing why I had decided to explain myself. 

"I don't need to explain myself to you," I said, mostly to myself. I refocused on my phone, finally finding the number for security. My finger hovered over the contact when she spoke up again. 

"How about..." she began, pulling her hands off herself and pushing herself off the desk and onto her feet. I raised my gaze for a moment to look at her. "Instead of using that phone to make a silly phone call, how about you use it to take a picture of these." As she started to slowly saunter towards me, she reached behind herself to unclasp her bra. Before I could pull my eyes away, the lace garment sprung from her soft, jutting breasts, falling to the floor. 

For the first time, I was staring at Tori K's huge, naked breasts. And despite everything I had been saying, all the denials I had made, I was certainly staring. I couldn't rip my eyes away. 

They were amazing. 

As put-off and angry as I was with Tori, I couldn't help but admit that her breasts were absolutely perfect. They were so huge! I had never seen a pair of breasts this big. I mean, I certainly wasn't the type of guy on the lookout for big boobs, but now that I was staring at them, I could certainly understand the appeal. They were enormous, jutting out from her fit body. They were full and firm, only making it more amazing that they somehow fit in a bra in a professional top. Those suckers looked like they couldn't be contained. They rode high on her chest, and their fullness allowed each of the mammoth udders to press into the other, naturally forming a deep line of cleavage. And her breasts looked so soft and smooth, the firm, tanned flesh rippling and jiggling with each step. Each of the huge boobs were capped by a hard, throbbing nipple, surrounded by a smooth, pink areola, pointing outward, begging to be sucked on. 

They were perfect. 

Yes, they looked amazing. Even I could see that. Her rack was enormous, and the soft, squishy flesh was practically begging for a pair of worshipful hands to squeeze them lustily. As much as I hated to admit it, I was tempted. They looked so soft! And those nipples... just fantastic! As much as I loved my wife, she didn't have a pair of mammoth jugs like these. She didn't have much in the way of breasts to speak of, to be honest. Not that that kind of thing really mattered, but it was certainly not a negative to have huge breasts on your side. That deep, dark, purely instinctual side of me wanted to plant my hands on those suckers and never let go. But I knew better. As tempting as they looked, I knew that only bad could come from touching those. A pair of breasts like those could make a man do bad things, and I was smarter than that. 

But damn, were those boobs sexy. 

I tried to clear my head, but it was difficult. They were amazing breasts, but that should be the last thing that matters. But still, they were hard to ignore. Hard to forget. Hard to prevent from being burned into my brain. 

She could see I was shaken by this sight. My phone was now at my side, momentarily forgotten. She was stepping toward me slowly, each step taken with purpose. 

"Tori! Put your damn clothes back on, now! And get the hell..." I began, my anger boiling over, but she interrupted my words by shaking her breasts side- to-side, and my vision was arrested once again. The sight of all the soft, succulent flesh bouncing, they took the words right out of me. 

"I can tell you like what you see," Tori said, her voice an insidious purr. "You can be honest with me, Paul. As your assistant, honesty is the best policy, so I want you to be truthful with me. I want you to be honest when I ask... do you want to squeeze my big, soft, naked breasts, Paul?" she asked, shaking her smooth, jugs side-to-side, causing them to hypnotizingly bounce again, her hard nipples dancing through the air. My eyes were again drawn to them, against my will, watching them move with every step. My mouth was dry, preventing me from responding. I don't know why I couldn't find the words to speak as soon as she made her tits or ass shake for me. It was truly as if they were hypnotizing. It was as if each mouth-watering bounce was stifling the logical side of me, making all thoughts of resistance submit. "You want my breasts, Paul. I know you do. You've always wanted to squeeze 'em. Even though you know I'm the office whore, and you're happily married, and that you should just know better, you've always wanted to get your hands on these," she affirmed, poking each of her breasts with her fingers, pressing into the squishy flesh. "You know it's wrong, but my tits are so big! It would feel so good to just squeeze them, right? Touch them, play with them, use them to your heart's content. No one would blame you. There isn't a man alive that doesn't want to get his hands on these, but not as much as you do. You've wanted them from the first time you laid eyes on me. I've seen you looking. Watching them bounce when I walk. Eyeing my cleavage when you thought I wasn't looking, but I was. Every time we talked, you couldn't stop yourself from taking one, quick glimpse at my breasts, dying to one day see them bare." That wasn't true, was it? I wasn't that kind of guy, to lecherously stare at an attractive woman. "Now's your chance, Paul. Take them in your hands. Squeeze them. Feel the soft flesh between your fingers. You know want to. I love squeezing them, and you will too. Trust me. So, just... squeeze them. No one has to know. What's the harm of having one, quick feel?" she teased, her voice heavy with lust. As she got closer, I stepped back, my shoulder blades hitting the door, the phone in my hand forgotten. 

As she approached, I was suddenly filled with a panic, as the entire dynamic between us changed, as if she had taken full control of the situation. As if her exposing her breasts had given her complete control. Suddenly feeling like a caged animal, I now realized my only course of action was to run. Just get away, damn the consequences. Tori K wasn't stopping, and just refusing to play this game anymore was the only play I had to make. 

I let my hand rest on the doorknob, about to turn it and escape from here, only to suddenly hear voices nearby. Damn! I thought everyone was pretty much gone for the day. Listening for a moment, I realized I was hearing the voices of the cleaners, having come in once everyone else left. I could burst out now, but if I did, they would see me and a half-naked woman alone in an office, when everyone else was gone. They would surely get the wrong idea. Rumors could spread like wildfire, which could bring a black eye to both me and the company. I know the company trusted me, and would have my back. If anyone asked why there was a half-naked slut in my office, I would just tell them the truth, and the company would back me up. They knew me, and they certainly knew Tori, so they would surely believe me. I would escape any serious trouble, but they would blame me for even giving Tori the opportunity to pull a stunt like this. They would think less of me for getting overwhelmed like this. They didn't want me to interview her in the first place. And my boss, Andrea's Dad... he would never look at me the same way. He would never be able to quite look at me almost like a son ever again. With all the risk I would face leaving the office, I felt my hand slide off the doorknob once more, not even thinking that there were two sizable handholds in front of me that were dying to have my hands resting on them. No... I couldn't go down that road. I couldn't think like that. I had to stand up to Tori. I had to find another way out of this. But they looked so good! What would be the harm... no. NO! Stop it, Paul! I can do this. I'm smart. I'm a negotiator. I shouldn't be able to be outmaneuvered by Tori K. I had to do this. I had to stop her. I just had to figure out a way to get out of this without immersing my hands in her massive boobs. But she was getting within arm's reach now, and she wasn't stopping. 

"Tori... this is a bad idea... don't you want to earn this job the honest way, and not use your body?" I asked, searching for anything to stop her. 

"No, I'm fine using my hot body," she replied simply, with a wicked smile. "It's gotten me this far, and besides... I love sex! I love fucking as hard as possible, with guys as hot as possible, with dicks as huge as possible. And clearly, you match up there!" she said with a laugh, gazing at my still bulging crotch. "And it's all the sweeter when those guys are married to plain, pathetic, boring girls who have no idea how to please a man. Who are practically BEGGING for someone else come along and steal their man from them." She paused about a foot in front of me, her striking eyes holding my gaze, biting her lip, as if barely holding herself back from jumping my bones. 

"Tori..." I urged, trying desperately to stop her. "This... this is the last possible way you want to be successful in life. So please, just walk away. For the last time... I don't want this. I am happily married. I love my wife, I..." I began, but before I could finish, Tori firmly reached out and planted her open palm against my throbbing bulge. I jumped in shock, and grunted as I felt this forced pleasure. 

"Mmm, you can stop pretending, Paul..." she whispered lustily, her deft fingers putting pressure on my clothed shaft, slowly traversing its length. "If you really loved your wife that much, you wouldn't be THIS hard!" she remarked, squeezing my throbbing meat. "Jesus Christ, you're fucking huge!" she said to herself, her fingers admiring my dick through my slacks. "I've never felt a cock this hard before. You must really like me," she said, wearing a knowing smirk on her plump lips as she stepped in closer. 

"Tori... Tori... please stop!" I begged, feeling my self control slipping away as she stroked my dick through my pants. I was frozen in place, unable to do anything to stop her. 

"Why stop, when you clearly love it so much?" she asked, more forcefully stroking me now. 

My eyes looked away from her evil smirk, my vision settling on the far window. With the light as it was right now, I could see our reflection in the mirror. Tori K, her lithe body standing in front of me, her round, thong-clad ass jutting out, her hips posed theatrically as her arms were in front of her, her hands doing their magic. Her taut, bare back looked sexy in this picture, as did her long, firm legs, in those smooth stockings of hers. Her high-heels only made her posture more striking and dramatic. And her breasts... Jesus, they were so large I could see the sides of them from behind her. 

And I could see myself, looking frozen and slightly disheveled, the pleasure barely hidden on my face. Despite my protestations, this did feel amazing. But I couldn't let this go on. This was way too far. I was married. I loved my wife! I'm a professional. I shouldn't be liking this. I shouldn't let this ambitious little temptress get her way, even if it did feel REALLY good. 

This couldn't have worked out any worse! I go a week without sex, only to find myself interviewing the company's biggest skank, who proceeds to put the moves on me. Who throws herself at me. And in my weakened state, she found a foothold, and she was taking advantage. Her hands were on my dick, and she wasn't letting go. 

She moved in closer, pressing her chest against me, her hard nipples scraping against my cotton shirt. And still, her hands were working, aggressively massaging my disobediently throbbing manhood. My hands were hovering in the air, not knowing what to do. I felt my phone slip from my fingers, falling to the floor with a dull thud, as if signifying the ground I was losing to her. 

"This hard fucking cock tells me everything I need to know," she whispered huskily, her softly spoken words in such close proximity to my ear making my spine shiver and my brain tingle. "You so want to hire me, don't you? You've wanted to hire me from the moment I applied for the job. You've wanted to work one-on-one with me from the moment you saw me shaking my hot ass and huge tits across the office. Didn't you?" she asked, her deft fingers tugging at my shirt, trying to untuck it from my pants. I couldn't find a response. "Face it, Paul Martin, you want me. You want my hot body! You marry girls like her, but you love girls like me. You need girls like me! You need a slut, don't you, Paul?" she asked, forcefully yanking the hem of my shirt from my pants. As her fingers danced against the bare skin of my now exposed stomach, she continued. "You need a wife for all that boring stuff, like bills, and cooking, and cleaning... ugh. But you need a slut like me for the fun stuff. She gets your heart, the sweet, loving moments, I get your dick! I get your huge, fat, swollen balls! I get this fucking hot body!" she gasped out, her fingers lightly and lovingly scratching against my fit stomach. "I get the hot, filthy sex. I get the hard fucking! She can have your heart, your love, I get to have the contents of your swollen nuts. All that thick, boiling cum sloshing around you sack belongs to me and me alone." 

"No..." I gasped out, her soft touch making me shiver again. 

"You hire me, Paul, and I'll rock your world," she began, running her fingers along the hem of my pants, teasing me as she gripped my clothed dick with her other hand. "Not only will I be your assistant, I will be your work wife. We'll spend most of our days together, fucking as often as we can, and then I'll send you home, barely able to walk, not even able to get it up for that pathetic excuse for a woman ever again!" she teased, her fingertips playfully dipping into the hem of my pants. "And we'll be having so much dirty sex that you won't be able to stop yourself from falling in love with me. You're little crush will turn into full-blown obsession, a type of love stronger than what you have with your wife. You'll love me more than your wife! You'll love my hot body more than anything! And you won't be afraid to show it... you'll give me money..." she paused, popping open the button at my crotch. "...fancy, expensive, sexy clothes..." placing her fingers around my zipper, "...a nice house..." she said, her fingers on one hand deftly lowering my zipper as the other lovingly slid against my stomach. "And maybe, just maybe, if we're lucky, you'll put a baby in my belly." 

"Wha... ahh!" I asked loudly, but the fight was quickly taken out of me, because as she made this insane prediction, her hand slid under the hem of my black boxer briefs, gliding down till I felt her fingers curl around the root of my pulsing member. "Oh God!" I moaned lightly, feeling her slim fingers against the bare skin of my throbbing dick. 

"Oooh, I think you like that sound of that!" she said, smirking at me as her grip traversed the length of my hard pipe, skin-on-skin. "Is that right? You like the idea of draining your nuts in the office slut's cunt? Giving the biggest skank in the company a baby? I think you do!" 

"No," I gasped out, trying my best not to acknowledge the pleasure her skilled hand was bringing me. I was pressed against the door, clinging to it, doing everything I could to fight off what she was doing to me.  

===

"But you're so HARD!" she remarked smugly, her hand working wonders on me. It felt so good! Dammit! How did I let things get this far? "I knew you were a sick fuck like me, and this fucking rock hard cock just fucking proves it! Now, let me take a look at what I'm working with here," she said, stepping back slightly, giving her busy hand some room to scoop my manhood from my pants. 

"Hooooolllllly shit!" she gasped out, eyes going wide as she took in my engorged penis in the flesh for the first time. My thick, fully hard nine-and- half inch dick was now exposed to her eyes, my heavy balls hanging below it, finally extricated from my pants and briefs. Tori was gawking at it, studying its impressive length for a few moments, appraising it lustily. "Jesus, Paul... I knew you were fucking big, but fuck... you're huge! How did this nice, sweet, charming man end up having a fat monster cock between his legs?" she asked, smirking at me as she maintained her grip around the root of my cock. "Unless you're not so nice. Unless you're not designed for business, but for pleasuring women." I shook my head, but I couldn't find any words. The pleasure was overwhelming. Seeing me in this state, her hand began to travel my length, affirming her control over me. "This dick is fucking wasted on a girl like Andrea! It needs someone like me to care for it in the way it needs!" 

"Please! Stop!" I begged Tori, pleading with her to let me go. I was so tense, so overwhelmed with pleasure... there was nothing I could willingly to do to push away this pleasure. Her hand felt too good to stop. My cock was leaking pre-cum, lubing her hand, making it all the easier for her to stroke me. 

"Not a fucking chance!" she sniped at me, stroking my rock hard meat firmly. "Fuck, that's a fat dick," she said to herself, before looking back at me. "This dick is mine now. I control it! I own it!" She focused on stroking me, her hand flying up my lengthy dick, causing her boobs to jiggle. My eyes fell to her jutting rack once again, their light bouncing almost hypnotizing "Tell me... tell me you like feeling the office slut jacking you off! Tell me how good it feels!" 

"No..." I gasped, pulling my eyes from her chest, knowing I wouldn't be able to think clearly while looking at their succulent flesh. My entire body was tightened, trying to resist the urge to explode. Her amazing hand had me on the edge, and after going a week without I needed to cum. She smiled at my fight, but she was undeterred. 

"Just admit it, baby," she said softly, leaning in close, her breasts pushing into my chest. "Admit it, and I'm yours. My hot body will be your fucking property," she whispered in my ear. 

"No..." I repeated. "My wife..." 

"Doesn't matter." Tori finished my sentence, still stroking me, her slick hand jacking me in just the right way. Her hand was a live-wire, sending electric shocks of pleasure all through me. "I'm your work wife... your little slut. Your whore to use. Doesn't that make me more important than her?" 

"Fuck..." I sighed, the pleasure too blindingly good to speak. 

"That's it, baby. Talk to me! Talk to me! Tell your fucking slut how good she makes you feel!" she insisted, aggressively stroking me. "Tell me you love it! Tell me how hot I make you! Tell me you love how slutty I am!" 

"Fuck you!" I groaned out, my entire body on edge. This anger only caused her to laugh. 

"I love it! I fucking love it! Look at what I do to you! Look how insane with lust I make you!" she boasted proudly, her chest scrubbing against mine. I could feel her throbbing nipples through my shirt. "I can make you cum at any time. I can make you cum now... or I can draw this out till you lose your fucking mind! Till you go insane for me! You can make this real easy and just admit to how much you're hot for me!" I shook my head, my neck muscles taut. She leaned forward and licked my tightened neck, her tongue made me shiver, almost making me lose it completely. Still working me over with her hand, she stepped back again, letting me gawk at her chest once more. 

"Why don't you squeeze my breasts, Paul?" she offered again. "It'll make you feel so much better, and besides... I'm already jacking you off. Compared to that, squeezing my big, soft, perfect titties isn't so bad, right?" she asked, her fingers lightly squeezing my heavy sack. 

I knew how wrong it really was, I did. But... I just couldn't pull my eyes away from those mammoth udders. I was so on edge, I couldn't think straight. They looked so smooth... so soft... so perfect. They were just begging to be touched. To be squeezed. I knew it was wrong, but Tori had a good point. It wasn't nearly as bad as what she was doing to me now, you know, jacking me off. How much worse would this whole thing be if I just squeezed her breasts? It's not so bad, right? 

I had laughed her off, rolled my eyes at this farce of an interview, and fired her, but now, I had successfully rationalized to myself why it would be a good idea to squeeze her massive breasts. 

God help me. 

Before I could think twice, my hands leapt from against the door, jumping forward, palm's open, until they made contact with the flesh Tori K's enormous breasts. At first, my touch was tentative, running my fingers and palms lightly over the smooth, succulent flesh. The expression on her face was uncharacteristically warm and patient, letting me take my time to appreciate this momentous occasion. 

"Feel my big breasts, baby," she urged me, encouraging me. I let my hands slide all over the enormous boobs, trying to feel every square inch of soft breast between my fingers, this act causing a deep, unfettered moan to escape from deep in her throat. I let my hands slide along the artful curves of her round breasts till my hands were cupping her massive jugs, bouncing them lightly, feeling their heavy weight in my palms. I was transfixed by Tori's huge tits, in a way I had never been before. My singular focus in this world was Tori's huge rack, and I couldn't get enough. I slid my hands up till they were pressed into the fronts of her large tits, nipples centered in my palms. I had resisted digging into the soft flesh for as long as I could, but with my hands fully spread out against her big breasts, my fingers digging lightly into the voluptuous flesh, I couldn't resist any longer. After feeling the softness for so long, my will finally broke, and my fingers reflexively squeezed, desperate to feel all of the boob fleshiness at once. 

Holy shit! They felt amazing! I squeezed over and over again, not getting enough. They were so big! And so fucking soft! They felt incredible in my hands. I was only squeezing tentatively at the moment, not fully digging in yet, and it was still the greatest thing I had ever felt in my hands. I had never been this close to a pair of big breasts, and now that I was feeling them hands-on, squeezing them over and over again, I was starting to truly understand the appeal. I kept squeezing them, feeling the soft flesh against my fingertips as her hard nipples dug into my palms. 

"Ooohhh fuck!" Tori sighed as I squeezed her soft breast slightly. "Get in there! Squeeze them harder! Harder!" she urged more insistently. I was so hypnotized by her huge breasts that I did whatever she wanted without thought or question. I squeezed her huge tits more firmly, digging into the soft flesh with my fingers, kneading the firm flesh roughly, and the sensation was just... incredible. I can barely express in words how soft and firm her huge boobs were. I couldn't get enough. I just kept squeezing them over and over again. My attention soon focused on her nipples, my fingers playing with the hard nubbins and her smooth areolas. 

My attention was so focused on Tori's tits that I was barely noticing the fact that Tori was still stroking my rock hard erection, not as quick as before, keeping me right on the edge, not letting my boiling balls simmer at any point. She wanted to keep firm control of my decision making, and she was doing a very good job at it. All I cared about were her amazingly huge, soft breasts and diamond hard nipples. My mouth was watering at the sight of them, and that fact was very clear to her. 

"You can suck on them if you want to," she whispered, still stroking me with one hand as she gripped the back of my neck with the other, trying to pull me to her. "I know you want to," she added, her whisper like the devil on my shoulder. But at this point, I didn't need any extra encouragement. I brought my mouth down to her chest, my open mouth soon surrounding one of her throbbing nipples. 

"Ahhh... fuck!" she moaned out, her nipple growing even harder in my mouth. I licked at the hard nub as I sucked at it, my open mouth taking her entire nipple. I attacked her nipple savagely, running my tongue across it, smothering it with saliva. "Yes... YES!" she moaned out, pulling me harder against her chest, trying to force more soft breast into my mouth. And she was succeeding, smothering my mouth with her soft udder, but I wasn't complaining. "Suck my tit, babe... suck it! YES! Suck my huge breasts because they're so much bigger than your wife's! Suck my big tits hard cause you've been waiting for years to do so! Worship my boobs with your mouth because my hot body deserves it... because my hot body is so much better than your wife's in every way!" I wasn't listening too closely to the words she was saying, so preoccupied I was. She pressed her breasts against my face, smothering me with the soft, firm flesh. With a pop, she pulled her spit-soaked nipple from my mouth, scrubbing both breasts across my face for a few moments before I was able to capture her other nipple between my teeth. 

"AAHHHHH! YES!" she moaned out, loving the feeling of my teeth on her nipple. I bit down on her nipple, causing her to squeal with delight. "Yes, I love it! You're mouth feels so good on my tits! I want you to suck on them forever!" I alternated between these teasing bites and some lavish tongue worship, eventually causing her whole body to shiver. "UUUGGGHHHHHH FFFFFFUUUUUUCCCKKKK!" she groaned out, clutching my mouth against her chest roughly as a small orgasm rippled through her lithe frame. Finally, with a soft sigh, she pushed my hungry mouth away. 

I looked up at her as she looked down at me, a content, satisfied smirk on her lips. She could not look more pleased with herself, and in that moment I realized that her insane plan was somehow working. She had already dragged me deeper than I could have ever predicted. But she wasn't done yet. Far from it. 

"You have a very talented mouth," she sighed, looking at me with a hungry lust in her eyes. "Now let me show you what my mouth can do," she finished, licking her lips. Smiling like the devil, she slid down to her knees, still maintaining her grip on my swollen meat. She stroked my cock a few times, pointing the engorged member at her face. Getting in close, she studied my hard penis, eyes hungrily consuming every ridge and vein. I looked down at myself, and I couldn't notice that I had never been so hard. My cock was iron in her grasp, swollen in a way I had never seen it. I could almost see it pulsing, seemingly right on the edge of exploding. 

"Mmm, now that's a good dick!" Tori marveled, leaning in close, smelling the animal pheromones emanating from my erection. I was suddenly filled with a panic, knowing we were about to cross another barrier if I didn't intervene. 

"Tori, wait, WAIT!" I said, holding out my hand as she moved her mouth close to the tip, close enough to feel her breath. She squeezed my aching shaft and looked up at me, her eyes gleaming with bad intentions. "We can't do this... my wife..." I exclaimed, panting, begging her to stop, understanding now that I didn't have the self-control I thought I did. Just slid her eyes back down, gawking at my meat again. If I wanted to stop this, I would have to convince her to stop. To end this. That was the only way. But she wasn't having it, and if she had heard me, she didn't deign to acknowledge me. 

"Oh my God, I'm gonna swallow every fucking inch of this monster!" she stated excitedly, eyes focused solely on the swollen tip. 

"Tori, please..." I begged, but at the same moment these words left my lips, her seductive gaze turned upwards, her green eyes meeting mine once again at the same moment she puckered her lips and planted a soft, wet kiss on the tip of my dick. "Ohhhhh... fuck!" I grunted out, unable to contain the pleasure. The tip of my cock was now moist with a mix of my pre-cum and her saliva. 

"You can act all innocent," Tori began, holding my eyes with hers, "But I know exactly what you want me to do right now... and you're about to get your wish." She then focused her eyes on the hard member in front of her, parted her lips, leaned forward, and let my throbbing meat enter her mouth. The tip of my dick broke the barrier, but her lips were parted wide enough so my thick cock didn't make any physical contact. I felt her breath, a few drops of hot saliva, but nothing else. No lips... no tongue. Nothing. She was withholding that pleasure from me at the moment. My cock entered her mouth deeply, but still, I felt nothing other than the wet heat of her oral cavity. She paused for a few seconds, before her hungry eyes lazily slid upward to meet mine and, at the same moment, her lips closed around the circumference of my aching cock. 

"Oh FUCK!" I screamed out at this long-awaited contact. At the same time, her tongue went to work, sliding against the underside of my needy shaft. She worked up to a steady rhythm, bobbing up and down my dick, taking about half of the length in her mouth. The tip of my cock hit the back of her throat over and over again, desperate to go deeper. 

It felt SO good! My wife wasn't exactly into sucking me off, but she would do it for me on special occasions. Her efforts when she did give me oral sex were fine, but they lacked the zeal that would be present from someone who truly enjoyed the act. Now Tori... it was obvious that she LOVED sucking dick! 

Her tongue was going wild, working my cock over, pleasuring my dick while soaking it with her hot spit. And the sensation of her plump lips wrapped around my thick, swollen dick was incredible. And just watching her perform this act on me... even that was enough to send a thrill through me. Her gorgeous face in lusty heat. Her ass behind her, looking so round and smooth, each cheek hanging out from her thong. And her big, bare tits, jiggling and bouncing as she sucked me, her hard nipples dancing through the air... the sight of it was almost enough to make me lose it. She was ferocious, sucking me as if she was starving for dick, her hot wet mouth savoring every inch. She was attacking my cock, diving deeper, trying to take as much hard dick down her throat as possible, but her tight throat was not allowing entrance despite her best efforts. But she kept trying, attacking my hard throbbing meat, trying to dig out space in her throat and in my lusty haze, still standing frozen against the door, the only thing I could think of was... why not help her out? 

Unable to stop myself, I reached forward and rested my hand on the back of her head. Her eyes twinkled at me as my fingers gathered a grip of her silky hair, and as she dove forward, I assisted her, pulling her into me, breaking through the tight barrier of her throat, allowing her to take more of my thick cock in her hot, wet mouth. 

"Holy shit!" I moaned out, unable to believe what I was feeling. Her mouth was like magic. I had never felt a raw, animal pleasure like this. No woman had brought this out of me, until now. I looked down again, admiring her dick- sucking ferocity. She got deeper and deeper on me, inhaling more of my meat, taking it down her throat partially, but she wouldn't be satisfied till she swallowed the whole thing. 

She dug her sharp nails into the backs of my thighs, gripping me tightly, using me as leverage to force more of my cock down her tight throat. Choking sounds came from her throat as she savagely inhaled me, but she didn't slow down. Spit was dripping down her chin, falling to her heaving tits, but she didn't stop. She wanted to swallow my dick, and she wasn't gonna stop till got the job done. 

"Holy shit, Tori! Your mouth feels amazing!" I sighed, unable to lie about the pleasure she was bringing me. Her mouth was magic, solely built to bring pleasure to any nearby cock she could wrap her lips around. My arm was more active, pushing her down onto my cock roughly as she forced herself down on it. 

She wasn't letting up. I don't know how she was gaining breath as she aggressively inhaled my throbbing member, but she kept at it, swallowing as much of me as I could. It felt amazing. Her tongue was firm and sinewy, working the underside of my shaft like an expert. Her plump lips sliding up and down my cock provided just the right amount of pleasure. My cock was nearly coated with her sticky saliva as her wet mouth lubed it up. Her mouth was a whirlwind of pleasure, giving every inch of cock a nearly indescribable pleasure. Well, nearly every inch. 

The pleasure was nearly blinding it was so good, and in that moment I realized, looking down at the fervor she was sucking me, trying to swallow my dick whole, I wanted her to reach her goal. I wanted to get every inch of my cock down her tight, slutty throat. I wanted to feel her plump lips wrapped around the root of my cock. Looking down at her, looking at her red face as she plugged her throat with my swollen meat, I wanted more. So, as she gave it one more go, shoving my hard cock into her hungry mouth, I pulled her in again, roughly, forcing my entire length down her tight throat. I looked down, seeing her nose pressed against my torso, her plump, sexy lips stretched to the max around the root of my dick. 

"AAAAHHHHH! FUCK!" I screamed out, feeling her tight throat squeezing my meat. I held her in place, holding my cock balls deep inside her gullet. Her face was screaming red from lack of air, but she wasn't making any effort to move. She was exactly where she wanted to be. Her tongue massaged my throbbing dick as it marinated in the heated oven of her slutty throat. I held her in place for as long as I could before finally, she pulled back, my swollen cock emerging from the confines of her mouth, completely coated with her sticky drool. Her spit was everywhere as she extricated my cock, bands of it connecting her mouth and my dick, some of it dripping onto her luscious chest. She panted for air, but she could not have looked happier, looking up at me, lust in her eyes. 

"This cock is amazing!" she gasped out, wiping the saliva from her lips. "I want you to fuck my face. My fucking throat is yours!" she said, eyes nearly insane with heat, her lips parted, ready for more. And in that moment, that's what I wanted too. I wanted to fuck her throat. I wanted every inch of my cock in her mouth again. 

Gathering her hair in my hand, I pulled her forward once more, forcing my big dick into her mouth again, sliding it all the way in until her lips swallowed the base of my dong. Gripping her tresses, I began to piston my dick in and out of her mouth, pumping its entire length, from tip to root, working up a smooth rhythm. And now that her throat had been prepped, she could take it. She could take my lengthy dick inside her no problem, swallowing it easily. I began to drive into her harder, my dick sliding smoothly into her throat, giving her my full length on every stroke, pumping so fast that my saliva coated balls were soon lewdly slapping her chin. 

For a few seconds, I had the power, my hips driving into her face as I maintained a rough grip on her hair, pulling her into me. But this was merely momentary, as she impatiently brushed my hand aside, gripped my thighs roughly, and began to force herself down on me harder than I had been, using my cock to fuck her tight throat savagely.  

===

"Fucking fuck! Amazing!" I moaned out. She went to town on me, smoothly taking my spit-soaked cock in her mouth, in and out, in and out, over and over again. Her face was getting red again from lack of air, but that didn't stop her from heaving herself forward once again, taking my full length down her throat and holding it here. Her lips were stretched wide around the root of my penis, forming a tight seal. Her tongue massaged my aching dick as she hummed slightly, the vibration traveling down my shaft to my saliva-coated balls, making them rumble again. And just when my balls were once again right on the edge of boiling over, she pulled back, my drool-soaked dick sliding out from her tight throat like an oversized serpent, never looking bigger. 

"No... fuck... please!" I begged, nearly in pain, I so needed to cum. I reached out to pull her mouth back onto me, but she easily brushed my attempts aside. Despite the fact that she was panting for breath, she looked up at me and gave me a wicked smile. Still holding my lubed cock between her fingers, she leaned forward, my cock achingly close to her amazing lips. 

"You like that?" she asked, her tone both arrogant and lusty. She moved forward and planted a gooey kiss on the tip of my dick again, a band of drool connecting my penis to the lips that had given it so much pleasure. 

"Yes! Please..." I begged, not able to fully say the words. Not able to tell her that the only thing I wanted in the whole world at this very moment was for her to take my cock between her lips one more time, so I could fuck her tight, slutty throat until I filled her mouth with the enormous load of thick cum brewing in my swollen balls. 

"Has your wife ever given you anything like that" she asked smugly, giving the underside of my dick a soft, languid, loving kiss, knowing the answer. 

"No... never," I panted out, knowing that even the thought of Andrea doing the things Tori just did was insane. Andrea was too nice and sweet and classy to do the things Tori did. She was above sucking dick like a complete whore. But Tori wasn't. A slut like her was willing to get down and very dirty. 

"Do you want me to make you cum?" she asked, softly kissing her way down the underside of my shaft. 

"Tori... please!" I begged, barely able to think straight, her soft, loving kisses enough to keep me on edge but not take me over, like everything she did. She was in complete control of when and how I would cum. 

She was very good at this. 

"What?" she asked, playing naïve and innocent as she slowly massaged my swollen nuts with her tongue. 

"Please... I need to cum!" I said, unable to hide my need. "I can't think straight!" 

"You want me to make you cum?" she asked, kissing each of my balls. "You want Tori K, the biggest whore in the company, to make you cum? You want the trashiest piece of ass in the office to give you the biggest orgasm of your life?" she asked, licking the underside of my dick, ending with a flourish at the tip. My face was twisted in blissful agony. I badly needed to cum. The pressure was almost too much to take. I had never felt anything like this. 

"Yes..." I sighed as she opened her mouth, leaning towards the tip of my dong, millimeters from taking the tip again, finally granting me this blessed relief. But just as my cock was about to enter her hot, wet mouth, she pulled back. 

"But what would your wife think?" Tori asked, acting innocent, but with a twinkle of malice in her eyes. "What would Andrea think? She's your sweet, loving wife, the boss's daughter... would she like to hear you begging the company skank to swallow your cum?" 

"Ugh... fuck you!" I spat out, leaning my head back against the door, my mind a whirlwind, my tortured state causing her to giggle. I only paused for a moment until I heard the snap of a picture being taken, only to see that Tori had picked up my discarded phone, poised my cock near her face, made a winky, kissy face, and snapped a picture. I was about to reach out to grab my phone from her, but she tightened her grip on my penis, holding me in place, hostage, a slave to her whims. 

"And now taking sex pictures on your cell phone of a nearly naked slut on her knees..." she laughed, "What a naughty boy!" 

"Just... please!" I yelled out, about to reach down to take care of the job myself, but she brushed me away easily. 

"Hire me, then," she said, her tone becoming firm. "Make me your assistant and I'll make you cum so fucking hard. Hire me right now, and I will swallow every drop of your thick, tasty cum, lick my lips, and beg for more. Give me the job, and I will give you the greatest pleasure of your life." She laid out her plan, extorting me, weighing the needs of my dick against my professional obligations. At that moment, as she laid it all out so plainly, a little bit of clear thought entered my brain, preventing me from compounding my mistakes any further. 

"No..." I finally forced out, denying her one true goal. Her eyes narrowed in annoyance. She let go of my cock and quickly moved to her feet. Turning her back to me, she sauntered away, her thong-clad ass shaking as she moved closer to my desk, walking smoothly in her high-heels. "Well, I suppose my mouth wasn't enough to get me hired..." she called out, not turning back to face me. She then put one of hands on the desk, pointed her butt at me, and finally looked back at me, her eyes full of wickedness. "But maybe my tight, wet cunt will change your mind." She then smoothly pried the miniscule, seemingly dental-floss sized string from between her ass-cheeks, dropping the thong to her feet. She balanced on her high-heels, posed artfully over the desk, her long, stocking-clad legs looking as firm and sexy as ever, her bare ass looking amazing, and from between her legs, her naked cunt was awaiting me, small, bare, and tight. 

"You could zip up, tuck that fat cock away, and go home right now to your pretty little wifey, and give it to her good and hard and work out all that... stress... on her," she said, gazing at my penis, speaking that option as if it was obviously the bad choice, although it sounded perfectly good to me. At that moment, the sounds of the cleaners' voices came through from the other side of the door. "And sure, you would be leaving a naked slut behind in your office for the cleaners to stumble on, but I would have to leave eventually, and no one would ever believe that you would even touch a slut like me. But we both know that's a lie," she said, pausing to hold out my phone again, snapping a picture of her naked body in the foreground and me, frazzled and exposed in the background. "You love touching me. You love my hot body. And it means more to you than your wife and your job, you love my body more than anything. And you can have it. You can take me over your big desk... a sign of things to come. Take my tight, slutty pussy and fuck me hard... feel my cunt wrapped around your fat cock. Fuck me hard, as hard as you've dreamed of, harder than what your wife can take. But I can. I can take your best. You can take out your filthiest, nastiest fantasies on me. You can have better sex with me than you've ever had with your wife, and you know that. You've always known I would be a better fuck than Andrea. I bet you listened enraptured whenever you heard gossip about me, listening for juicy details so you could imagine me in your wife's place." 

"No!" I called out, trying to deny her insanity, despite how far I had already gone. Despite the fact that my hard dick was hanging out of my pants, dying for her loving touch. 

"Oh okay, deny it, after I sucked your cock better than you could have ever hoped for," she said, still with her butt pointed at me, waiting for me to act. "Deny it after how lost you became when you were worshipping my tits. Deny it after how all your talk and defenses crumbled as soon as I gave you the slightest peek at my hot body. Face it, Paul. I was right about you. Deep down, you're just like the rest. You're just like all the other hypocrite board members who ALL have a piece on the side. You can be the greatest guy in the world, but that all goes out the window when a hot piece of ass like me saunters by. So, c'mon! Man up! Bring that fat cock over here, and take me like you deserve to. Take my tight little cunt and make me your bitch!" she demanded, smacking her ass, causing the firm cheek to jiggle. 

"I can't." I sighed, my cock still throbbing, stopping me from thinking clearly. The purely raw, physical part of me wanted her. Wanted her badly. I wanted to feel her no-doubt tight pussy wrapped around my aching shaft, fucking her as hard as I could, taking out all this lust that had been building up in me. My traitorous cock had clearly already made up its mind. But, my brain... my heart... it was still rightfully holding me back. Tori rolled her eyes in annoyance, growing impatient with my hesitance. 

"Paul, you could have left a long time ago, but you haven't. You know you would escape this thing scot free even if someone did find out, but you're still here. You could go home, find your wife, pull her into bed, and take out your lust on her. But that doesn't sound like such a tempting offer anymore, does it? You know that what's waiting for you at home will never compare to what's standing in front of you now. Doing that filthy stuff with me will be MUCH more fun. You know that, and you know better than to hook up with me, but being bad is so much more exciting. If you weren't married, you'd have been balls deep inside me an hour ago," her eyes held mine, and as much as I wanted to disagree, I couldn't. "But I'm hotter than your wife. I have a prettier face, better hair, better lips, as you know. And I have a better body. A MUCH better body. I've get better legs..." she said, looking down at her taut, stocking covered legs. "A way better ass..." she said, twerking her ass for a moment, causing the cheeks to bounce. "And most importantly, my tits are WAY bigger and WAY better," she said, turning her upper half to the side slightly so I could appraise their smooth, round, perfect shape in profile. They looked huge from this angle. She smiled, knowing that everything she said was the truth. "If you could change the past, it'd be my finger you'd put a ring on," she said, pausing, letting that sink in, turning back so she was bending over the desk again. I tried to deny it, but looking at her luscious, naked body... it was hard to disagree. Knowing what she could offer, and how my body reacted, it was hard to deny at this point that there wasn't an attraction there. She slid her hand down her side, sliding it down over her jutting butt, down between her legs, sliding a finger into her dripping pussy. 

"We both know why you haven't yet..." she said, staring into my soul as she fingered herself. "Because you already made your choice. Because after doing what you've done so far and not sealing the deal... you're always gonna wonder what if. You're always gonna think about my body and wish you had had the balls to do what needed to be done. And you can go home and try to make like this never happened, but you're nice streak will come out. Your guilt will when over, and you'll tell Andrea what you did with me. How you got your dick sucked by the office slut. She'll hate you and she'll leave you, and you'll lose everything, and the worst thing would be that... you didn't just fuck me. You didn't go through all the way with the cheating. I mean, if you're gonna cheat, cheat hard! Right? Don't stop with getting your cock sucked. Get some pussy. Get some ass. Do it hard and nasty! Paul, as soon as I walked through that door, you were making the decision to fuck me. As soon as my hot ass and huge tits entered this office, you were done for," she finished, pulling her finger from her vagina, sliding it up between the cheeks of her ass, toying with her asshole. 

If I wasn't hard, harder than I'd ever been in my life, I might have been able to think straight. But deep down, I knew everything she said was true. I wanted her. I wanted her hot body. I wanted those huge tits. I wanted to fuck her. Even if I mentally denied it, my body had shown me otherwise. I know I was married, and I know that simple lust shouldn't outweigh that bond, but like Tori said, this had gone too far to turn back. I wouldn't gain anything by walking out of this halfway through. There was no difference between what I had already done and what she was offering. She had already inhaled every inch of my beefy married dick, how much worse was full-on sex? Why not just do it at this point? Why not just fuck Tori's brains out, take care of the overwhelming pressure in my balls, and then just be done with it. Why not ravish her hot ass and huge tits with my hands? If no one ever found out, no one would be getting hurt. It would be a low moment for me, something I would have to learn from, but at this point, the pressure was too great to pull back now. At this point, I had to do it. It was wrong for so many reasons, but my hard dick was silencing those objections. I knew how messed up it was, but it would feel SO good! 

But my wife... I loved Andrea. I love her, I mean. I couldn't do this to her, could I? How could I live with myself if I did this, if I fucked Tori? I just... I didn't know how it came to this. It seemed like one minute, I was in complete control, the next I was doomed. Tori had set the trap with her hot body and blunt seduction, and despite everything, despite knowing better, I had sprung it, and now sex between us seemed unavoidable. I loved my wife, but... Tori's really hot. So insanely sexy. That body... that ass... those tits... I couldn't think straight near that body. She had used it as a weapon, slowly pulling me in, till I was drowning. That body shouldn't outweigh the love I had for my wife, but... it had already caused me to sink this far. She had flipped the script in a masterful manner and part of me, despite everything, was impressed by that level of skill. 

"Are you gonna keep standing there, or are you gonna fuck me?" Tori spat out, daring me to act. I was suddenly filled with a heated anger I had never experienced before. She had caused this turmoil in me. She had done all of this damage. She had put a dent in the person I thought I was. She had interceded herself into my marriage. She was a twisted, evil, scheming little bitch, and she needed to pay for what she had done to me. I was jolted into action, and my thoughts crystallized. All the questions in my head were answered. 

Was I willing to throw away my professional ethics, my marriage, my personal code and the foundation that I was born and raised on, all to get some good pussy? 

Yes. Yes I was. 

I stepped forward, moving closer to the slut bent over my desk, my hard dick leading the way. I couldn't hear anything, as if white noise was buzzing in my ears, freeing me from any other distraction, keeping my sole focus on Tori's fantastic backside. I could believe I was actually going through it. It didn't seem real. I wasn't myself. Something had changed in me. Her attitude, her body, it had infected me. Poisoned me. Corrupted me. And she was about to experience what she had done to me first-hand. 

Before I knew it, I was poised behind her. Her hands were on the desk, ready, looking back at me, waiting for me to act. She was going to pay for making me do this. She was going to pay by her having her tight pussy stretched around my thick cock until she came. I was going to make this bitch scream, and then she would know what she had done to me. 

I looked down at myself, my throbbing, nine and a half inches hanging out from my boxer briefs, pointing right towards her ready cunt, which was literally dripping her juices. My pants hadn't fallen too far, stretched between my thighs, the front of it stained from the evidence of her sloppy blowjob. And in front of me, mere inches from me, was Tori, bent over my desk, butt pointed at me, waiting for me to act. My eyes were drawn to the tattoo above her ass. The striking green of the ornate, thorny vines, and the brilliant reds of the blooming roses standing out against her smooth, tan skin. It was enough to arrest my vision for a few moments. I let the fingers on my right hand slide across the smooth flesh of her lower back, where the tattoo was imprinted. As I did, my eyes grazed along the round, perky ass cheeks, down the neat, artful crevasse of her ass crack, to the bare, puffy, soaked lips of her pussy, waiting for my thick penis. With my fingers still playing with her tattoo, I used my other hand to grip my cock, moving it closer to her waiting vagina, till the tip grazed against it. Looking up, knowing this was the point of no return, I paused, finding Tori looking back at me. 

"Just push it in, Paul," she urged, her tone surprisingly soft and comforting, as if she knew pushing me too hard in this moment would turn me away. "My cunt is so tight. It wants your cock so bad! It wants to squeeze it and smother it and make you explode and give you the greatest pleasure you've ever felt! Take it, Paul... push it in. You've earned it..." she said, appealing to my ego, shaking her butt slightly, willing me forward. And it worked. Not wanting to wait too long to talk myself out of this, I pushed my dick forward slightly, the tip of my cock splaying out the lips of her cunt. 

It was official, now. By any definition, I was officially cheating on my wife. 

"Uhhh!" Tori sighed softly as the head of my cock pushed inside her. 

"Oh my god!" I let out, the pressure of her pussy around my cock head feeling amazing already. Using both hands, I gripped her hips tightly and began to push more, forcing more of my swollen dick inside of her. "Ohhh... fuck!" I moaned, the pleasure of her pussy was just exquisite. She was so tight! Tighter than I had ever felt. Much tighter than my wife, tighter than any other woman. It made pushing my cock deeper into her more pleasurable, but it also made forcing her tight walls apart a bit more work. 

"Fuck, you're big!" Tori moaned, her head sagging slightly. She was swiveling her hips, trying to angle it so more of my cock could get inside her. "More baby... more! I want to feel your balls slapping my clit!" she urged, pushing back at me. I flexed my hips, forcing more cock inside of her, till she had somehow taken three quarters of my length. 

"Shit!" I grunted out, impressed she had taken so much of my dick. Andrea had never taken this much, but Tori could. Tori was built to take large dick, better than my wife could. I looked down to see the lips of her pussy stretched taut around my thick shaft, gripping it, holding it inside her. Her internal muscles were squeezing my cock so fucking hard, massaging my dick, pulling me in deeper. I paused for a moment, holding my cock inside of her, letting it marinate in her sex-juices, but the urge to go deeper soon won out. I pushed my cock deeper, sliding it inside her another inch. 

"Ughhhhhh... FUCK!" Tori moaned out, the pleasure making her shiver. She slapped my desk, groaning in pleasure. As she pushed back at me, I pushed forward, till finally, her butt was against my torso, my cock buried up to the root inside of her. 

"Ohhhh shit!" I moaned, my head rolling slightly. It felt so god damn good! She had an expert pussy, doing magic to my cock, squeezing every inch of me, teasing me, working me over like the fucking slut she was. Only a slut's pussy would know how to do these things. Only a slut's pussy could feel this good. 

"How does that feel?" Tori asked, her tone turning nastier. "How does that fucking cunt feel? Tell me, Paul. Fucking tell me!" she begged. 

"Feels so fucking good!" I groaned out, my eyes screwed shut in pleasure as I held myself in place. She squeezed her cunt in a steady rhythm around my bloated cock, almost bringing me over the edge. "Amazing!" 0 

===

"If it's so amazing, then why don't you fuck it!?" she asked, her snotty tone returning. "If you love my tight cunt so my much, then give it the fucking it deserves!" Reminded that I did in fact hate this woman for what she was making me do. I made a vow to take my revenge. I vowed to make this bitch squeal. I reared back, sliding my cock out so only the tip was inside her before reversing course, driving my dick in her to the root again. 

"Ah, ohhhh!" Tori moaned. Gripping her hips hard, I began to work up a good rhythm, pumping in and out of her. 

"Fuck!" I grunted out, feeling her tight walls squeezing my hard meat. 

"You like that... shit... you like that fucking tight cunt?" Tori asked, her ass bouncing back me in a perfect rhythm to my driving hips. 

"Yes! YES! It feels so fucking good!" I grunted out savagely, not sounding like myself. 

"Hahaha! I knew you would!" Tori said with an evil smirk. "I knew you'd love my tight cunt! Now you know why all those other guys risked their careers to have me. Cause my slutty cunt is THAT fucking good!" 

"Ughhhh..." I grunted out, pistoning my cock inside of her, my cock now coated with her juices, allowing to me to smoothly drive my cock in and out of her. I was fucking at a harder pace than I ever had before, but I knew a whore like her could take it. 

"You didn't think I'd be this fucking tight!" she said knowingly, her round ass slapping against my pelvis as I pulled her against me. "I've fucked so many men, but I'm still tighter than your nice, sweet, classy wife." My face curled up in anger as she insulted my wife, causing me to fuck her even harder. "Ughhh, fuck that's good! This dick's amazing. I love it!" she moaned out, unfazed by my angry fucking. "All the other girls in the office wanted you... they flirted with you, smiled, told funny and cute stories, hoping that you would fall in love with one of them. But I fucking stroll in, like the queen bitch, shaking my ass, jiggling my huge tits, and I just fucking take you! I make you mine! FUCK YES! Fuck me, baby. Fuck me! Fuck the office slut!" 

I drove into her harder, angry at her boasting. Angry that she was right. I tried not to let her know how much her pussy was getting to me, how close it had me already. On every pump in and out of her, her pussy squeezed me tightly, not wanting to let my swollen meat go. Squeezing me hard, bringing me indescribable pleasure. In anger, I pulled my fingers from her sizzling skin, reared back, and slapped her ass. 

SPANK! 

"Ahhhh, fuck yeah!" she moaned out. "That's it, baby. That's it! Get into it! Play fucking dirty! I always fucking knew there was a stud in there, bursting to get out. Fuck me baby. Slap my ass and fuck me!" 

SPANK! SPANK! 

I repeated the motion, slapping her ass harder, causing the round cheeks to bounce. 

"AHHHHH! YES!" she screamed out, her voice rough. She pushed herself up a bit more, till her lean back was pressed against my front. I wrapped my arm around her stomach, holding her close as I continued drilling up into her. She reached up with her arms, reaching behind herself to wrap her hands around the back of my neck, arching her back artfully. Her body was stretched taut as she kept pushing her butt back to meet my driving hips, and in this position, her chest was pushing outward, making her breasts look absolutely enormous. "Look at them! Look at my fucking tits!" she said, her face next to mine. My eyes looked down, over her shoulder, staring at her bouncing jugs. They looked so round, and smooth, and just fucking huge. They looked like fucking blimps on her chest, way too big for slim frame, jiggling in just the right way. Tori turned to me and kissed my cheeks a few times before bringing her lips to my ear. "Squeeze them... squeeze them, baby. Squeeze my huge fucking tits! They're yours, now," she urged me. 

I couldn't resist. 

I slid my hands up her front, raising them up till I filled my big hands with her enormous breasts, squeezing them roughly. 

"Ahhh, yes! Fuck yes!" Tori moaned into my ear. They felt amazing, the mere minutes from when I last squeezed them suddenly feeling like an eternity. How could I ever take my hands off of amazing tits? They were incredible! They were so soft and luscious and firm. I kept squeezing the pliant flesh over and over again, gripping them roughly, feeling their softness pouring through my fingers. "Tell me... ugh, fuck yes... tell me how much you love them. Tell me how much you love my fucking tits!" 

"Ugh... fuck!" I groaned out, feeling pleasure from both my cock and my hands, almost the maximum pleasure those body parts could feel. "They're fucking amazing!" I said, complimenting her huge breasts. "They're so fucking big!" 

"You love them! Tell me you love them!" Tori groaned out, her butt slamming back against me as I fucked her, my hands still digging into her big, smooth boobs. The infinite softness of her massive rack was an addiction. I could spend the rest of my life squeezing those big boobs and it wouldn't be enough. 

"I love them..." I relented. "I love these huge fucking tits! They're... fuck yes... they're fucking incredible. The best fucking breasts I've ever seen." 

"Guhhh, yeah..." Tori grunted. "You can't honestly say you like your wife's chest after feeling these." 

"Ughhh, fuck... fine. Yes! YES!" I groaned out, driving into her a little harder, her slights against my wife for some reason making me want to fuck her even harder. "Your tits are better than hers, okay? You have the best God damn tits I've ever felt." 

"You hear that Andrea!?" Tori screamed out. "Your husband thinks I have better breasts than you! He likes them so much he fucking stopped an interview just to feel them! FUCK YES! Yes! He couldn't make it through a fucking job interview without molesting my huge fucking tits!" She screamed as I gripped her giant breasts roughly, fucking her harder as she called out my wife's inferiority. "Ugh... fuck! SHIT! I love it! I love this fucking cock! Andrea... you stupid fucking bitch! You should never have let your husband work in the same building as a slut like me! You should fucking take care of your husband, or else he wouldn't take out his lust with the office slut! He wouldn't have to talk the company skank out of her clothes in the middle of a job interview!" I fucked her more firmly as she rewrote history, making me out to be this lecherous guy. Then again, I was fucking her tight, slutty pussy with my married cock, so I didn't exactly have the high moral ground here. 

"You're such a fucking bitch!" I grunted out. "Don't talk about my wife!" I urged her, still fucking her firmly with the full length of my throbbing cock. 

"You love it!" she proclaimed, kissing my cheek again. "You love to hear your fucking wife get fucking trashed. You love hearing me make fun of your dumb, boring, plain wife! You love hearing about how much better of a body I have then her. You love hearing me talk about how much bigger my huge breasts than her tiny little boobies." I began fucking her harder in anger. "Ahhh! Yeah! That's it! Yes! Show me how much you hate me by fucking me harder! Yes!" she urged me, her ass slamming into me as I drilled her. "I'm prettier than your wife! I have... ugh fuck... I have better hair! Yes! A prettier face! Uhh! Longer legs! Shit yes! A better ass! Bigger fucking tits! Fuck! I have a better body than your wife and you fucking love me more because of it. FUCK YES!" she screamed out, my fucking getting harder and harder progressively as she insulted my wife more and more. My anger was about to boil over, as were my swollen nuts. 

SPANK! SPANK! SPANK! 

"UGGHHHHH FUCK!" she cried out, her voice almost hoarse as I slapped her ass in anger. Her pussy squeezed my cock as her body tightened and shook, the pleasure feeling even better. My hands gripped her tits roughly, before I let my fingers find her hard nipples, tweaking the rubbery nubs hard. "AHHHHH YES! UGH!" she said, fucking back at me hard, the pain turning her on even more. "Fuck me harder than you've ever fucked your ugly, dumbass wife! Give me your best! Don't save any for that piece of shit, pathetic excuse of a woman!" 

"You're fucking evil!" I said, fucking her faster. Both of us were coated with a sheen of sweat as this fuck went on and on. 

"And you fucking love it!" she called out with a laugh. "I'm the evil, cutthroat bitch you need at your side. Fuck yes!" she moaned out, her fingernails digging into my neck as hard as my hands were digging into her firm rack. "Look... look at us," she said, gesturing at the window with her chin. I looked away from her bouncing breasts, up towards the window. The sun was getting low over the city, and in the window, with the light the way it was, our translucent reflections were projected on the glass. 

Tori was front and center, her luscious body exposed to the world. Her firm frame, her bouncing, jiggling breasts, all displayed proudly. And then, behind her was me, looking like a different person. My face twisted in pleasure, my hands very busy, sliding over and squeezing her mammoth breasts. Normally, I had no shame having an open window into the world, cause all the work I did in this office was work I took pride in. But this, this was an act of corruption. A secret act. A dark act. An act that should be done behind closed doors. An act that shouldn't happen at all. But Tori, she was making me do this. She was making me do this act in front of the entire world. There were people walking around the city, looking like ants from way up here. There were cars driving below us, their lights shining, unaware of the nastiness going on up here. Anyone looking in could see my corruption. 

"This is where we belong..." Tori said as I drilled her clutching pussy. "In a big office, looking over the city, above all the other people. The normal people. People like us belong above the rest. People like us get to fuck while other people just toil away, cause we deserve it. Cause we were built for it. Cause we're better than them." Tori was officially letting her feeling of superiority fly. 

"You're fucking crazy!" I said, her pussy feeling amazing. I was getting close, and somehow, I could just tell, she was getting close too. 

"You love it!" Tori laughed, the side of her face rubbing against mine, a strangely intimate feeling act. "You love my crazy ass! If you didn't, you wouldn't be fucking my hot ass over your big, fancy desk! You wouldn't be feeling up my hot body! You wouldn't be fucking me while your idiot wife waits for you at home! You wouldn't be about to hire my hot ass to work at your side! Fuck yes!" This statement caused me to laugh. 

"Ughh... no! I'm not hiring you!" I said with an almost mocking laugh. I didn't hold out on cheating on my wife, but actually hiring her felt like a loss I wasn't willing to accept. "I'm not fucking hiring a slut like you!" I boasted, sliding my throbbing cock in and out of her roughly. 

"God! That cock! Yes! Fuck... well, we'll see if you change your mind once you fill my tight snatch with your creamy cum! Once you fire off that thick, tasty cum deep inside my fertile cunt... once you know how good it feels to cum inside me... yes, fuck! Once you know that, you'll be eating out of the palm of my hand! You'll give me whatever the fuck I want just to have my hot ass and HUGE FUCKING TITS BY YOUR SIDE! FUCK YES!" she screamed out, her body shaking. 

I knew better than to cum in her tight pussy, but as I turned the corner, I couldn't stop myself. The idea was too tempting, and deep down, the only way our encounter had to end was with a cream-filled pussy. I had to cum in her pussy, just to know I could do that and still not be conquered by her. If I could do that and walk away, I could be done with her forever. 

Deep down, I knew I was lying to myself. I knew it made zero sense that cumming in her pussy was the way to avoid a continued affair, when it was in fact one of the surest ways to cement our affair for good. Because squirting my thick load nine-and-a-half inches deep in her fertile cunt had a very good chance of ending in one very bad way for me. It could end with her being a knocked up slut with power over me, but that thought wasn't enough to stop me. I just kept driving into her, our bodies clutched together in heated, filthy sex. 

"Fuck me, Paul, fuck me!" Tori screamed out, her hips driving back at me. My hips matched hers, our conjoined bodies a blur as we fucked, both seeking the same outcome. "Tell me... guh, fuh... tell me you fucking love it! Tell me you love my cunt!" She started squeezing her cunt hard around me between sentences, making me almost lose it. "Tell me my cunt means more to you than your wife!" Squeeze. "Tell me you would throw away all those happy memories..." Squeeze. "Those romantic moments..." Squeeze. "That perfect life you two have ahead..." Squeeze. "Your perfect professional future..." Squeeze. "You would throw it all away to have my body again!" Squeeze. "All the things meant for your wife..." Squeeze. "The money..." Squeeze. "The fancy clothes..." Squeeze. "The big house..." Squeeze. "The beautiful babies..." Squeeze. "You'll give all of those to me instead!" Squeeze. "Just to be able to fuck me again! YES!" she said, her cunt gripping my cock like a vise. 

"AHHHH! FUCK!" I grunted, her twisted words sending a ripple down my cock. I was very close to losing it. I slowed down my pace, giving her slower, harder strokes. 

"Yes! YES! Fuck me, Paul! Fuck me! Give me that fat fucking married cock!" Tori squealed out. "I want it! Make my slutty cunt cum, baby! Make me cum! Fill my slutty pussy with that hot, married cum! All that cum that was supposed to end up inside Andrea tonight... give it to me instead. Give it to your slut! Give your cum to your fucking whore! Give me the cum you've been waiting years to give me! Please!" she begged, her nails digging into the back of my neck, gripping me roughly. And despite myself, with her filthy words, I turned the corner, and my body went into overdrive. 

I finally released her humongous breasts, my hands sliding back down to her hips, purely for the increased leverage. I drove into her harder, driving her up onto the desk as I deep-dicked her. Our bodies were slamming into each other as a ripple went down my body. 

I was about to explode. 

"Fuck!" I grunted out, my hips a blur as drove into her, my fingers gripping her hips roughly. 

"Oh my God!" she screamed out, her hands falling from my neck and landing back on the desk. "Ahhh! I'm gonna cum! I'm gonna fucking cum! Make me cum, Paul! Fuck my nasty cunt! Make me fucking cum! Make my slutty pussy cum! Yes! Yes! YES! Fill me with that married dick! YES! YES! YES! YES!" 

"Holy shit! I'm gonna cum!" I said, driving forward, my cock about to explode right alongside her. A spasm of pleasure shot through me as I fucked her at a furious pace, about to find the pleasure I'd been seeking for so long. My body was running on adrenaline, not feeling anything but the pressure from my dick. "Uh... UH... UGHH! YES! YES! YES!" 

"FUCK...FUCK YES! YES! YES! YYYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS! FFFFFUUUUUCCCKKKKKK! IIIIIIIIII'MMMMMMM CUMMMMING! YYYYYEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!" Tori screamed out, her cunt spasming around me, sending me over the edge. 

"AHHHHH! FUCK YES! UUGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!" I grunted out, cum exploding from my cock, the first savage band of thick jizz leaving my cock with an almost painful pleasure, firing off into her very unprotected pussy. My balls flexed and tightened as my cock pumped thick, married seed deep into the waiting clutches of her tight, clutching cunt. I drive most of her body onto the desk as my body flexed against her, driving my cock deeper inside her as my cock kept filling her with hot cum. 

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! YYYYYYYEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!" Tori screamed, her body spasming wildly as she came, her limbs knocking my computer and some pictures of Andrea off the desk, among other items, sending them to the floor with a crash. Her sweaty naked body slid against the hard wood of the desk as our bodies jerked against each other, riding out our mutual orgasms. We were both mostly on the desk at this point, with me on top of her jerking body, my body flexing as I kept on firing more cum deep inside her amazing cunt. I was a grunting animal, at this point, my cock pumping a seemingly endless supply of thick cum deep into her waiting snatch. Her tight cunt was squeezing every last drop out of me, the tight walls clutching me, pulling me in deeper, not letting go till the job was done. Our bodies jerked against each other, until, at nearly the same moment, the tension left both of our bodies. The reservoir of cum in my balls had seemingly run dry, and I collapsed on top of her, breathing deep, trying to recover. 

A few minutes passes as we both gathered strength after the vicious fuck we had just taken part of. Eventually, I began to recover, rational thought starting to re-enter my brain. As I lied on top of Tori on my desk, I was finally able to think clearly. Everything that had just happened finally hit me. 

Oh my God! 

What had I just done? Holy fuck! What the fuck did I do? I... I just cheated on my wife! I just cheated on the love of my life with... with this skank! The office slut! What the fuck was I thinking? I knew better, I did. I knew exactly what could happen, yet I played it out anyway. I let this happen? What the fuck was I thinking? I knew exactly what kind of woman Tori was and I had let this farce play out to the point where I fell victim. 

But at the end of the day, Tori wasn't to blame. She had played her hand and it had worked on me. I had been seduced. I had cheated on my wife. I might have been in a slightly more vulnerable state, but that was no excuse. I had sex with another woman. And not just any woman, but Tori, an ambitious slut who had nothing going for her but her hot body and filthy mind. My wife was everything you could ask for in a woman, but Tori K... she was a self-proclaimed sex object. A gorgeous face that just screamed pure sex, long firm legs, a hot round, juicy ass, and a pair of huge soft, smooth jiggling tits. It was so wrong to value those things as being more important than things like personality and work ethic. Yet Tori had dug in deep enough to find a part of me that did value a pair of huge tits and a hot ass over my wife, and I had succumbed. 

I slid my body off of Tori's and pushed myself back up onto my feet, pulling my semi-hard dick from her taut pussy. I felt dirty in all ways. I had been touched by Tori's poisonous ways, and looking down at myself, my clothes were soaked with Tori and I's combined sweat, and the clothes near my torso area were stained with our combined sex-juices. 

I stumbled slightly as I found my balance, my limbs weakened from exertion. I backed away from Tori and made it a point to not look at her luscious, splayed out body, knowing now how dangerous she was, and how easily she could grab hold of any weakness on my part. At this moment, I wanted nothing more than to just get away, but I was so disheveled and had so obviously just had sex, that I had to pause and figure out what the fuck to do. With all these thoughts racing through my brain, all this panic and guilt, I stumbled backwards, the back of legs hitting my couch, causing me to fall back into a seated position on the sofa. I put my head in my hands, trying to figure out what to do. 

I had betrayed my wife. I wasn't the person I thought I was. How... how could I live with myself? How could I be around my wife, seeing her pretty smiling face, and act like I hadn't betrayed her trust? Should I just come clean? Should I admit what happened to my wife and deal with the consequences? I can't imagine how badly she would be hurt and let down by my actions. And her father... my job here was over. If he found out that I had cheated on his little princess, simply losing my job here might be the best outcome. 1 

===

"Uhhh, fuck that was good!" Tori moaned out, recovering from her world shaking orgasm. I couldn't help but glance up slightly, just in time to see her peel her sweat-soaked body off my heavy wooden desk, pushing herself up to her feet. Stumbling for balance, as I had done, she found her footing, amazingly still in her high heels. She stood up straight, putting her hands on her hips facing me, her juicy, sweaty naked body exposed to me again, her huge tits bouncing slightly. Despite having been balls deep inside her, this was my first full- frontal view of her bare pussy, completely shaved, the two small, puffy lips looked immaculate. I had to look away, burying my eyes in my palms, not letting this temptress pull me back in again. "So... I assume I've got the job now, right?" 

"No, Tori... I don't think that's a good idea." I said, not even looking up at her. 

"So..." she began, "You have sex with one of the job applicants on your desk, you bend her over and ravage her, cheat on your wife with her, you have the greatest sex of your life with her, you cum inside her tight, fertile cunt, and then... you don't give her the job? Hahaha, I'm sorry, that just does not make any sense. You can let me walk right now, but when I stroll back in here in a couple months clearly knocked up with your baby, and word gets out... I seem to think you'll come to regret not hiring me." She paused for a moment, letting her threat linger, and I could hear her footsteps as she approached me. "Face it, Paul... we're lovers now. You had hot sex with the filthy office skank, Tori K. I was right about you all along. You're not this perfect paragon of virtue... you're a man, a dirty, filthy nasty, hunk of man who wants what all other men want... the hottest women. The best pussy... the roundest ass... the biggest tits. These things are what's actually important... these are the things you look for in a woman, deep down, and it's why I'm a better woman than your wife. And that's why you fucked me..." 

"Tori..." I interrupted, "Please... just go." I begged, still not looking up. 

"Oh, it's too late for that..." Tori replied simply. Standing in front of me, she reached down and took hold of my chin, lifting my gaze up to meet hers. My eyes drifted over her bare pussy, up her fit belly, to her mountainous, jutting breasts, before I met her smiling face. "Paul, we're together now, whether you like it or not. I'm your slut now. We've gone too far to go back. The only choice you have, if you want to be able to keep working this job, and to keep going home to that sweet, pretty wife who loves you... is to make me your slut, permanently. You've already fucked me, baby, and that's not gonna stop. It can't stop. It feels too fucking good to stop now. That was the best sex of my life... who would have thought I would get that from you? You're like me now... you need sex constantly. You can't walk away from this. You need this. Paul... you're just gonna need to learn how to lie. All these people who trust you, your coworkers, your wife, your father-in-law, they'll believe anything you tell them. So when they ask why you hired the underqualified office slut, you can make something up, tell them how I blew your socks off in the interview, about how much potential you saw in me, say... whatever, and they'll believe you. Cause they trust you. They love you. And they'll believe whatever you tell them, because all your good honest work has earned that. You can get away with anything at this point, even fucking your hot assistant. Despite their suspicions, despite the fact that the smartest, hottest, most brilliant salesman in the company hired the underqualified office slut, the one with the huge tits who has a reputation for sleeping her way to the top... they won't even question you. Sure, they might suspect something, but that trust you've built up will win out. So you see? You can get away with fucking me for the rest of your life, and no one will suspect a thing. And if you really think about it, at this point, after all the nasty things you did here today... the only way you have a good life is if you keep fucking me." 

My mind was in turmoil as my thoughts raced, trying to desperately find a way out of the mess I had found myself in, but unfortunately... she was right. She had come to the same conclusion that I had. Any other way out would lead to turmoil for me with my marriage, or professional turmoil, or both. The only thing I can do to maintain the status quo was to keep this affair on the down low, keep Tori happy, and try to make sure no one suspected any impropriety. 

Tori was right. I had to lie. To my wife. My boss. My friends. Everyone. 

I looked up at Tori as she gave me a warm, loving smile, as if she knew how severe my life was being flipped around. 

"Here, baby, let Tori make you feel better," she said, kicking off her heels, pushing me back on the couch as she climbed onto my lap. 

"Tori... I don't think this is a good idea..." I said, still drained from our last session, but she simply looked down at me and smiled. 

"You want to know the best thing about married guys," she asked, reaching between us to grab my still half-erect dick, beginning to stroke it again, causing my head to roll. "They are so starved for good sex that they are ready to go like that!" she said, and sure enough, my cock began to rise. "If you're gonna keep doing this, Paul, it's gonna be easier to just accept who you really are. Accept that you're a cheating, sex-crazed stud. Accept that what matters to you isn't a girl's resume, but her cup size. Accept that you're gonna spend the rest of your life having very good sex with a very bad girl. With the amount of sex we're gonna be having, and the fact that I will be having ALL of your babies... and Andrea will get none... Paul, you're gonna start loving this. You're gonna start loving me, and my hot body, more than your wife, if you don't already. So... you might as well just enjoy it. You might as well have fun with it. You might as well get off on it," she urged me, her hand stroking my still slick, lubed with sex-juice dick insistently, soon working me up to full hardness. I was amazed at how quickly I rose, at what she was able to bring out in me, showing that she seemed to know my body better than I did. 

I thought over what she said. The conflict was still boiling inside me, and as shocking as my future now seemed, I saw no way to avoid it. So why not just let the guilt go? If I had to do it anyway, why not just enjoy it? As long as no one else was getting hurt, why not let that guilt fade away? 

As I debated the merits of her offer, she positioned herself over me, her soft breasts slapping against my face. She moved my once again throbbing dick, sliding my tip across the entrance to her pussy, going farther back till my cock was pressing against her asshole. She paused for a moment, shaking her butt slightly, teasing the head of my dick. 

"Get ready, Paul..." she cooed, pressing her breasts into my face, molding them against me, her hard nipples scraping my face. "My ass is magic! It will make all your guilt just fade away. Once your balls deep inside my ass... you'll accept who you are. You'll accept your place with me! You'll take me as your full-time slut with no regrets!" 

"Tori..." I said, not finding any other words to say, trying to desperately to avoid the fate she had declared for me, trying to resist the allure of her tight asshole. She saw my hesitation, the last shards of the good person inside me rising to the surface, and she sought to stamp that out for good. And to do that, she decided to use her most powerful weapons. 

"Here," she said, guiding one her hard nipples to my open mouth, "Suck my tits, baby, and let Tori do the rest." Her nipple now plugged into my mouth, I had no other thing to do but to suck the hard nub, finding comfort in the soft breast of this ambitious slut. And as I sucked on the succulent nipple, she forced herself down, her asshole stretching around the head of my dick. "Ahhhh fuck!" she screamed out. 

"Hnnnnggghhhhhh!" I grunted into her firm breast, the pleasure of her tight butthole a whole new level of pleasure. It was so goddamn tight! I had never been in a girl's ass before. I had never been with a girl that did anal. I had never pushed a girl for it, knowing it would be too much to ask for from any normal, self-respecting, classy woman. But Tori... she was far from normal. 

How could someone have it all going on in this way? All of Tori's holes were like magic, solely designed to pleasure cock. They all felt undeniably amazing! Her ass felt incredible! It was gripping my hard, thick cock so fucking hard! Her ass was a miraculous, tight, clutching fuck-hole, squeezing my throbbing erection. It felt insanely good! I had never felt anything like this before. I had never understood the appeal of anal sex, but now, I totally did. Tori was showing me what a tight ass can do to a man, and despite everything, my cock was in heaven. It loved it. It loved her ass. 

She really had it all, her body was perfectly designed in every way, and she knew how to work it. She knew how to use every part of her body in a way I had never experienced. She kept pushing her ass farther down, forcing more of my hard cock inside her, my meat stretching her tight hole. 

"Ahhhhhhh! YES!" she screamed out as she took half my dick up her crazy tight rear end. She wrapped her hands around my head and pulled me into her chest, forcing my face deep into her cleavage, smothering me with soft flesh. As she pulled me into her luscious chest, more of my cock entered her ass, causing me to grunt in pleasure, my moan muffled by her large rack, barely escaping the depths of her tender cleavage. She scrubbed her breasts across my face, the large mounds forcing my face to slide back and forth in response. My mouth found her diamond hard nipple as she leaned back, forcing more of my cock up her ass. The pleasure was incredible. As her ass swallowed even more of my swollen meat, the blissful ecstasy making me bite down on her nipple, chewing on the rubbery nub. "FFFUUUUCCCCCKKKKK! YES! YES!" she squealed, leaning back farther, her head falling back as she pushed her chest upward, my mouth still attached to her nipple. I pulled my mouth from one of her mountainous breasts and feverishly attached it to the other, capturing the hard peak between my teeth. She kept flexing her ass, trying to force it down into me. I pulled her body back up, till I was back in a seated position, her on top of me. This quick motion caused her to bounce on me, and in the process, her ass hit my hips, her asshole now stretched around the root of my aching shaft. 

"Yes! YES! FUCK YES! Oh God, you're so big!" she sighed, her ass spasming around the meaty pipe invading her ass. She stayed in place, not moving, getting used to the thick truncheon, squeezing her ass around me. 

It felt so goddamn good! Her ass was easily the tightest hole I had ever experienced, and it wasn't even close. The only thing in the same ballpark was her tight, clutching cunt, but this was on a whole new level. Plus, the knowledge that I was balls deep in a girl's ass, the inherent nastiness of the act, it sent a lusty thrill through me. 

Despite the fact that I had had the biggest orgasm of my life mere minutes prior, Tori's ass had my cock absolutely throbbing! The full length of my cock was firmly encased in her hot, smothering, squeezing ass, massaging my full length, giving it a blissful pleasure I had never felt before. My seemingly empty balls were now refilling with cum at a furious pace. As Tori K's ass kept gripping at me, and squeezing at me, any hesitance I had been feeling was soon replaced with lust. Any shame I felt was being stamped out by the overwhelming pleasure her tight ass was bringing me. Any thoughts of Andrea, my wife waiting so patiently for me... lost... as I rubbed my face in Tori's huge, luscious rack. Any thoughts of my professional ethics... forgotten... as I had my dick lodged in a job applicant's severely tight ass. Guilt, shame, hesitance... it was all a distraction. Obstacles getting in the way of the amazing sex I could be having if I just let go. Blinding me from the hot women I could be having at the end of my dick. 

Women like Tori. 

Finally, I let those thoughts slip away, the pressure coming from my groin beating any objections down, stamping them out. It was so much easier to just forget them. It was so much easier to not think about that stuff. It would be so much better to forget everything and just fuck! 

Tori was an amazing fuck! A piece of ass if there ever was one. At this point, this type of sex could not be forgotten, and I would not deny myself this type of pleasure for the rest of my life. If no one was getting hurt, why not have a little fun? Why not fuck Tori K's hot, juicy body again and again and again? Why not have this pleasure, plus a loving wife at home, plus all the success at work? I could have it all! 

In my sex-addled state, this sounded like a mighty tempting way of life. A way of life that, like Tori K, was too tempting to resist. As she squeezed my swollen cock with her ass, and she rubbed her huge tits over my face, there seemed to be only one real choice. 

As if a shadow passed over my face, my expression changed. Pulling my face for a moment from between her mammoth jugs, I met Tori's eyes with mine, and, letting my lips curl into an animalistic snarl, I growled a command. 

"Fuck me, Tori... fuck me!" 

Her plump lips curling into an almost proud smile, she used her taut thighs to lift herself up, raising her ass up, releasing most of my meaty pipe to the cool air of the office once again, leaving only the swollen head inside her. As she raised herself up, she slid her huge, sweaty breasts across my face. She held this position for a few moments, teasingly, before driving herself back down, her ass slamming into my thighs as it swallowed my thick weapon again. 

"Ohhh!" I grunted out. 

"Fuck!" Tori squealed out, her ass quivering around my thick meat. She began to work up a smooth pace, working the entire length of my cock on every stroke. 

"Your God damn ass is amazing!" I cried out, screwing my eyes shut for a few moments. 

"Your cock... fuck... your cock is the best cock I've ever fucked. Holy shit!" she screamed out in violent pleasure. Her bouncing tits kept hitting my face, the smooth, sweaty flesh gliding across my chiseled features. I put my hands on her hips, helping her drive down more firmly, helping my thick, lubed cock slide into her impossibly tight asshole. 

"Oh my God! It feels so fucking good!" I screamed out, my body flexed and tensed as her furious bouncing caused her mammoth breasts to roughly slap my face, the firm, doughy flesh hitting my visage, only adding to the lust I was feeling. 

"Tell me... fuck... tell me!" Tori cried, moaning as she furiously rode my aching, pulsing meat, her ass working every inch of me. "Give me the fucking job... and all that goes with it! Fuck... please!" she panted, riding me hard. 

This was it. The moment of truth. The moment where I had to make up my... 

"Yes!" I screamed out, watching this amazing slut riding me, proving her worth as a skank and a job applicant. "The job is fucking yours! Just keep riding my fucking dick with your amazing ass!" 

"Yes! YES! YES!" Tori screamed out, somehow riding me even harder at getting the good news. "You'll give me tons of money, more than any other assistant?" 

"Yes! Fucking shit... whatever you fucking want... it's yours!" I told her. Her ass squeezed my cock even harder. 

"Fuck yes! YES! I love it! I fucking love it!" Tori squealed. "You'll buy me clothes... a house... you'll give me babies?" she asked, her body riding mine. 

"Yes! Yes! Yes!" I grunted out an affirmative, sending a jolt of tight pleasure rippling through her. 

"Oh my God!" she said, jumping forward, slowing her bouncing, pressing her body against mine, moving her lips to my face, kissing my cheek over and over again. "I love you! I fucking love you! Hold on... I want to feel your chest." Tori reached to my shirt and grabbed it by the middle, firmly ripping the two sides apart, sending the buttons flying, exposing my bare, fit chest to her. Hungrily gazing at my body for a moment, she pressed her body into mine, our sweaty chests sliding against each other. And then, something happened I didn't expect. 

We kissed. 

For the first time, Tori's soft, plump lips met mine. Her mouth opened, as did mine, our tongues quickly and feverishly meeting in a deep, filthy French kiss, easily the lustiest kiss I had ever taken part of. Her tongue worked circles around mine and I tried to keep up, my married mouth kissing her slutty one. She finally pulled away from me, spit stretching between our lips as she leaned back and let out a victorious laugh. 

"HAHA! Yes!" Tori laughed out, resuming bouncing on my needy cock as I held her leaning body, supporting her. "Talk to me, baby. Tell me who you really are. Tell me you're the man I always thought you were!" she begged of me. 

I didn't hesitate. 

"I'm a dirty, cheating fucker. YES! A man who loves sluts like you! Fuck yes!" I told her, driving up into her. 

"You've always been fucking hot for me... haven't you? Haven't you?!" she insisted. 

"Yes! I've always been attracted to you, you fucking bitch!" I told her, causing her to laugh again. "I've always noticed your big fucking tits! The way you walked, shaking your hot fucking ass! I loved how you were always such a fucking bitch to me! It was so goddamn sexy! I loved hearing the fucking rumors of all the nasty shit you did! FUCK YES! GOD! I love it!" I screamed, not sure if these words were even true, but the pleasure of admitting them anyway felt too damn good. 

"You wanted it to be you!" she called out, running her hands over my bare chest lovingly. "You wanted to be the guy in those stories! GOD YES! That's why you're interviewed me! You wanted this to happen! You wanted the office slut to come after you? You wanted me to steal you from your wife! You wanted your cock deep up my ass! Didn't you... DIDN'T YOU?" she asked, riding me violently, no doubt bruising my thighs. 

"FUCK! FUCK... your ass... it's incredible," I moaned out. "Yes... YES! I wanted to be one of those dirty fuckers who fell victim to your charms. I wanted to feel your huge tits and amazing ass! I wanted to feel if your cunt was as tight as I thought it would be. I wanted to go balls deep in your tight fucking ass!" 

"Hahaha! Yes! Wifey's not getting the job done, huh? FUCK!" she cackled, flexing her hips, driving into me roughly. 

"Ughhh... fuck! No... she isn't as good at this as you are! SHIT! Yes! You're a better fuck than my wife!" I admitted, and at this statement, her asshole clenched around me. 

"Guhhhhhh! FUCK! Yes! Tell me more! Fuck my ass you son of a bitch, and tell me how much better I am than your fucking wife!" Tori begged, nearly drunk with pleasure. 

"Fuck! FUCK! Okay... okay!" I began. Despite everything, I did still love my wife, but I had to admit, I had the same reaction that she did when I slighted my wife. Tori squealed in pleasure when I bashed Andrea, and my dick throbbed. I guess it wouldn't hurt to do it a bit more. Andrea would never know, and the sex would be even better because of it. "You're better looking than my wife." 

"Fuck!" she moaned out, riding me harder. 

"You're sexier..." I grunted out. 

"Yes!" 

"Your ass is so much better." I groaned, sliding my hands over the round cheeks, squeezing them as she rode me. 

"God yes! More!" she begged. 

"And your tits... your enormous fucking tits..." I began. 

"Yeah? Tell me... tell me how much you like my big tits better than your wife's flat chest?" 

"Yes! They're incredible!" I moaned out, slurping on her nipples as they slid across my mouth. "So fucking big... and soft," I moaned out, sliding one hand up to squeeze at her bouncing breasts. "So much better than my wife's! Compared to you, my wife has nothing! Compared to you, she's barely a woman! She has a pair of pathetic, inferior, sad little breasts!" I said, the words getting away from me as I insulted my sweet, loving wife, but Tori's reaction, and my own, almost made me get carried away. The more I said, the harder she fucked me, and the harder I drove up into her. 2 

===

"Fuck! FUCK!" she screamed out. "Tell me you love me! Tell me you love the office slut's hot body more than your pathetic fucking wife!" 

"Yes! YES!" I screamed. "I fucking love you! I love your ass! I love your fucking big tits! I love your fucking hot body more than my wife!" 

"Oh my God! Fuck me Paul! Fuck me! Fuck me hard, baby! Make me cum!" she urged driving into me with blinding speed. I drove up into her, our sweaty bodies slapping together loudly. My cock was sliding in an out of her tight, gripping asshole as if it were made to do so, the slick, meaty pipe pistoning in and out of her stretched-to-the-brim asshole. 

"Yes! YES!" I groaned, the pleasure almost too much to take as I shoved my cock into her ass as hard as I could. 

"Fuck me, Paul! Fuck me!" she screamed loudly, her ass slamming into me at full speed. 

Our sex was loud and rough. The cleaners would no doubt hear the sounds of illicit sex behind the locked doors of this corporate office and would just assume some lecherous executive was carrying out some sort of illicit, after- hours affair with some skanky secretary. 

They would be right. 

"I'm gonna cum, baby!" she moaned out, pressing her chest to mine again. "I'm gonna fucking cum, baby!" she screamed out. 

"Me too, Tori," I replied. "I'm gonna fucking cum in your slutty fucking ass!" I screamed out. 

"Yes! YES! Fill my tight ass with that hot, thick married cum and forget all about your pathetic wife! Fuck my ass, stud! Fuck me like the fucking man you are! Fuck me!" she screamed. 

"Yes! YES! YES!" I screamed out, turning a corner, feeling my balls beginning to boil. "I'm gonna fill you up! I want to fill all your fucking holes every fucking day! Yes!" 

"You'll get it baby! Three times a day, minimum! I'll be the best god damn assistant ever! Yes! Now fill my fucking ass with cum!" she commanded. 

"Oh my God! I... I'm gonna cum!" I warned, my cock swelling up. "Oh my god! Oh my God! HHHHHOOLLLLLLLLYYYYYYY FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK! YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!" I screamed out, cum exploding from my cock, a thick savage band entering the deep recesses of her tight, clutching ass! 

"Do it, baby! Do it! Yes! YES! YES! YES! YYYYEEEEESSSSSS BBBBBAAAABBBBBBYYYYYY! YES! YES! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Tori screamed at the top of her lungs as a violent orgasm ripped through her. She slammed herself into me, taking in my full length just as the orgasm shredded through her luscious body. Our bodies tightened and jerked as we came together again, my balls flexing as I kept firing thick, heavy bands of cum inside of her, over and over again, the biggest orgasm of my life, buried in the office slut's ass! It was incredible. Everything else was forgotten, the only thing remaining... the pleasure. 

She spit out every curse in the book as she rode out her hard cum, my ears ringing as she shrieked in pleasure. Her arms were wrapped around me and mine around her, her huge boobs pressed roughly into my chest. Our bodies kept flexing as she kept cumming and I kept filling her tight ass with hot cum. This went in for many minutes until I finally relaxed again, completely drained, and her hot body collapsed onto me. 

Neither of us spoke for a few moments, unable to find the strength to form a word. It was incredible, the best sex of my life. Tori was amazing, an amazingly talented slut. And I would need her, cause I wouldn't be able to give up this type of pleasure. Never. She was too god damn good at sex to let go. She was a diamond that I had discovered. She was exactly what I needed. She was the best candidate. 

She was the perfect, corporate slut. 

She pushed herself up, our sticky, sweaty bodies peeling apart. She moved her head down, kissing my sweaty chest over and over again, kissing just above my pounding heart, before savagely licking the sweat off my neck. She pulled herself from me, eyes heavy with lust. She looked down at me as she lovingly squeezed my softening cock with her asshole. Her plump lips curled into a satisfied smirk. She moved her lips to my ear and whispered: 

"We're not done yet." 

And we weren't done. Not by a long shot. 

Still recovering, she pulled me to my feet, only to drag me over to the chair at my desk. Pushing me down into it, she knelt between my legs, taking my semi- erection into her mouth. As she did this, she had me call Andrea, letting my wife know I would be running very late. As I talked to my wife, Tori's amazing mouth worked wonders, somehow coaxing me to full hardness once again. By the time I hung up on my wife, I was hard as steel, unable to stifle the pleasure anymore. 

The next fuck we had was truly a marathon one. I fucked her from behind once again, against the window, her sweaty body sliding against the thick pane as I drilled her tight, clutching cunt. As we fucked 32 floors above ground level, staring down at the people below us, I was filled with a sense of power. Of superiority, as if I was making a statement to the rest of the city that I was above them all. 

She rode me for a little bit on my office chair, riding me hard and firm, before pulling me on top of my desk, knocking pretty much everything off of it onto the floor. She was riding me on top of it, her huge boobs hanging down over my face, their light bouncing keeping me frozen to the spot as she rode me, previewing a position we would no doubt be repeating in the future many times. We kept fucking vigorously, and we eventually ended up on the floor in front of my desk, her back facing me as she rode my hard dick. Her tight cunt eventually coaxed one last thick load from my aching nuts, firing deep into her womb once again. She rolled onto the floor next to me, both of us looking up at the ceiling, huffing and puffing for breath, our bodies coated with sweat. She finally lifted her head and got my attention, her nearly drunk-with-pleasure- face staring down at mine. I looked towards her just in time to see a smile cross her smooth lips. 

"So..." she began, "I'll see you Monday?"

(4 Months Later) 

(Tori) 

"Yeah, Andrea, I'm sorry he can't talk right now, but the negotiations have been really crazy. He literally doesn't have a spare moment," I said, lying on my belly, curling a lock of my hair around my finger, lazily kicking my leg in the air like a teenage girl excitedly sharing gossip on the phone. 

"I figured so," Andrea said, "But I just wanted to check in on him, see how things are going." 

"Well, I tell you what, when he gets a free minute, I'll have him give you a call," I replied. 

"Thanks, Tori, I really appreciate it," Paul's wife said. "How's he been? Every time I've caught him lately, it seems like I keep catching him at the wrong time." 

"Yeah, he's been a bit impatient lately," I replied. "I tell you, he's been on my ass lately." 

"Oh, I can't imagine him being that bad," Andrea replied with a laugh. I laughed in reply. 

"Haha, yeah, maybe I'm overselling things," I replied. Underselling, more like. 

"Well, I'll let you go, I know you guys are busy, so I'll leave you to it," Andrea said. "And thanks again, Tori, it sounds like you've been a lifesaver for Paul. He raves about you." 

"Oh, it's my pleasure," I replied with a knowing laugh. 

"Okay, give Paul my love," Andrea said. 

"I will." I said with a smile, knowing I would certainly be giving him some love, and he would be giving me the same. "Okay... bye," I said, rolling my eyes just as I hung up the phone. "Ahhh..." I said to myself, "Time to get back to work." I tossed the phone onto my bag. 

I turned my half naked body onto my back, letting the hot, Brazilian sun hit nearly every inch of my exposed flesh. I closed my eyes as I baked in the sun, letting my smooth skin get the perfect level of tan. 

These last four months had been the best of my life. When I got hired as Paul's assistant, the bosses had a lot of doubts. From what Paul told me, they had sincerely begged him to reconsider, but he stood pat. His father-in-law, more than any of them, seemed the most wary of me. He didn't even want to be in my presence, as if he thought I was poisonous. I could feel the distaste for me coming from all the higher-ups, but despite their doubts, our work spoke for itself. 

In the four months since my hire, Paul's success was unprecedented. The money he was bringing in, the deals he was striking, they were better than ever. It couldn't be denied that I played a part in that. Despite everything, despite being seemingly unqualified for the job, I was actually really damn good at it. I was born for this job. Like I had told Paul, he needed a cutthroat bitch like me in the boardroom. He needed the bad cop to his good cop. I had taught him how to properly do business. And it worked. Oh, it had worked. My aggressive nature and huge tits had pushed Paul to new heights, new levels of success. Thanks to me, he had gained more of an edge, negotiating deals that weren't nearly as soft-hearted as before. Where previously, his deals would really benefit both sides, now... we were making bank. We were demolishing these companies, these people who weren't nearly as good as we were. They thought they were making good deals, deals that would help them, but we weren't. We were chewing them up and spitting them out. It was an indescribable rush eating all those other companies alive, absorbing them into our larger, superior, more cutthroat company. It was cold, callous business, but it worked. And the execs were noticing, becoming more welcoming now that I was helping them fill their bank accounts. Me and Paul... we were a dangerous team. 

And the sex was amazing! 

I held up my end of the bargain, every fucking day. I would suck him off when he was under pressure. I would be there for him when the stress was getting too much to bear, bending over his desk and letting him take out his stress on my hot body. And when I was in need, I would stroll right in there, get on his desk, spread my legs, and beckon him forward. I would interrupt his important phone calls to make him eat me out, showing him where his true priorities lied. I would get on my knees, point my butt at him, and pull apart the cheeks, making his mouth water as he stared at my tasty asshole, waiting for him to act. I would sit on his lap, driving him wild, making him hard until he lost all control. We fucked in the office two or three times a day, at least. 

It was fabulous. 

Paul backed up his claims, giving me money, buying me presents, you know... giving a slut like me the life she deserved. This bitch was loaded now, and my bank accounts were only getting fatter. My house was huge, and my car was the envy of all my friends. And I didn't even have to force it out of him. He loved spending money on me. Giving me a healthy chunk of the cash he and his wife had worked so, so hard for. Wasting that money on his little slut, spoiling me rotten, more worried about keeping me happy, not even concerned about his wife finding out. He called me his secret weapon, and that I had earned every fucking penny. 

It was pretty sweet. 

The best part of my new life was the travel. These were the times I felt like I was living the high-flying life a bitch like me deserved. We had traveled to a few places for negotiations, but the biggest one was this Brazil trip. They had allotted two weeks for us to hash things out. 

Thanks to my help, we had negotiated the deal in one day. 

And we had really fucking owned them, too, making almost 50% higher than the expected deal. But at the rate we had been going lately, this wasn't a surprise. 

As I had proudly boasted to Paul, it was my sexual appeal that spurred our success in the boardroom. At first, I don't think he really believed me when I proclaimed that, but the results spoke for themselves. I can't tell you how many times I caught one of the guys across the boardroom table staring at my tits. They would try to stay focused on their work, but their eyes would always drift over to my exposed cleavage, losing their will to fight back in the deep crevasse between my breasts. Paul would hammer out the specifics, knowing we had the advantage, and the guy on the other side of the table would be so dazed by my perfect rack they would sign off on anything put in front of them. 

Sometimes, I would have to bounce them slightly, really making sure our rivals were under my spell. For the ass men, I would have to bend over at every opportunity, or show a bit of whale-tail, and they would end up in the palm of my hand. Some men needed a more personal approach. I would meet with them privately, and while I never gave them any sex, I would show a hint of skin, a bit more cleavage, and I would tease them, telling them whatever they needed to hear, promising them opportunities to be close to me, knowing that would never happen, but the mere possibility was enough to make most of them sign off on their own company's doom. 

It shouldn't be this much fun destroying rival companies! 

The women in the boardroom weren't any more formidable. Most of the time, they were old ladies, or boring, career-focused women, not equipped to deal with a slut like me. Business women shouldn't have tits that big, they were no doubt thinking. Most would be so intimidated as they leered at my chest, at my seemingly overstuffed blouse, fuming with jealousy as they stared at my huge, bulbous breasts. Most of the women were never the same after that point. By the time my enormous rack entered the boardroom, they were done for. They were just so intimidated by my hot body they couldn't get their act together, and we would crush them into dust. 

The only time I would show even the slightest bit of mercy is when I would recognize a kindred spirit on the other side of the table. Women like me who seemingly knew the score as soon as we walked in. Women who were practically as hot and sexy as me. It didn't matter how big or small the company we were talking to was, if there was a slut like me on the other side, I would listen. I would hear them out, and give them the respect they deserved. I was nothing if not charitable, and I was more than happy to help other sluts into positions of power. We would talk plainly and openly, putting sex on the table from the start, treating it as the valuable commodity it was. The only details to be hammered out were the when's, where's, and how often's. 

But this Brazilian trip was something special from the start. On the day we arrived, the boss from the company we were negotiating with took us out to dinner. The man himself didn't seem to be anything special, nothing to be worried about, but his hot, young wife... she was spectacular. I think both me and Paul were transfixed with her from the start. She was a former model who had married rich, living off her husband's money, not working. But she seemed capable of so much more. 

She had perfectly styled, shimmering black hair. Her smooth, tanned Brazilian skin was immaculate, and her body... it was mouth-watering. She had these massive, smooth, succulent tits, pouring from her slim, stylish black dress. And her ass was everything you would expect from a Brazilian woman, perky, and round and full... just amazing. 

She was beautiful, of course, simply gorgeous, but her most striking feature was her eyes. They were simply stunning, telling us everything we needed to know about her. She was a few years younger than both Paul and I, but there was a wisdom and intelligence in her those eyes we recognized immediately. We watched her appraise us, with the cool laziness that only a woman of her intense beauty could pull off, and we could both just tell that she had us spied out immediately. Just staring at her... it was clear she was reading us like a book, but she didn't say anything. She didn't warn her husband. It was if this little game was amusing to her, and she wanted to watch it play out. It was as if she didn't expect much from this corporate dinner, but upon meeting us, she perked up, seeing an opportunity for a bit of fun. 

Her name was Carolina, and despite the fact that she didn't speak up, me and her were communicating. Through knowing deep glances, small signals, osmosis, I don't know, I couldn't fully explain it, but the message she sent was clear. She was on our side, and she would do what she could on her end to help us win these negotiations, in exchange for a bit of fun. As we parted for the night, and I discreetly slipped her my number as she kissed my cheek, I was already assured of victory. 

I don't know what it was she did that made her husband more susceptible, but out-negotiating him wasn't even hard, and it was clear to both me and Paul that she had clearly done something to weaken his defenses. Knowing what we were playing for, Paul and I were extra motivated as we cut this guy down, eating his company alive within hours, a freshly minted contract hammered out by the end of the day. And the best part was, after this guy's rough day, he didn't even have his lovely wife to come home to. 

She was with us. 

Not only did we demolish this guy in the boardroom, we capped it off by double- teaming his wife. Carolina... she was a fucking goddess. I fucking love that bitch. She was absolutely insatiable, and she easily kept up with us. We did it in every way we could think of. Paul fucked her on all fours with me beneath her, our naked bodies sliding against each other, our tits pressed together, our plump lips joined together as Paul drilled us both, switching between us, filling both of our hungry cunts. Carolina rode him roughly as I lovingly rimmed her ass. She returned the favor when Paul drilled me into the bed, my legs on Paul's shoulders as she crawled beneath us. I had never been prouder as I was that night with Paul, admiring the stud he had become. With my help, he had discovered that so many problems in his life could be solved by using his dick, and boy, he had gotten good at that. His dick would be the pen that would sign off on these big business deals, making them official, and instead of signing off on these deals with ink, they would be signed off with his hot, thick cum. He was magnificent as he pleasured us both, filling all of our holes with his fat, married dick. And I swear, his balls were seemingly producing cum on overdrive. I don't know how he did it or how he'd become that insatiable. He just kept going. And that type of energy was well rewarded. 

Paul received the best of us that night. We were all over him. We worshipfully pleasured him, wrapping our huge, bare, soft tits around his thick cock. We inhaled his cock with devotion and swallowed his cum lovingly. We gave him a good show, eating each others' cunts and asses in a heated 69 right in front of him. And when the night ended, and he hosed down our pretty faces with cum, I reveled in what I had done to him. Mere months ago, he had been the type of guy who did everything the right way, in business and in life. Now, he was fucking his slutty assistant, winning business negotiations like a lion hunting prey, and then claiming what is his, railing his business rival's wife after demolishing him in the boardroom. 

I had made a monster out of Paul, both in the boardroom and the bedroom. 

He was barely the same man anymore. He still maintained his bullshit good guy act to the people that still believed he was pure, but not with me. He was, without a doubt, the dirtiest boyfriend I had ever had, by far. He had come down to my level and he was reveling in it. The things we did in the bedroom... it was beyond nasty. It was so filthy I could barely describe it. Things that almost made me blush! It was amazing! 

With our work being done, I convinced Paul we deserved a vacation. So, instead of heading right back home, we opted to stay in Brazil, celebrating our hard earned victory. We drank... we partied... we fucked. We had gotten up to some crazy adventures. These Brazilian women were insane! I loved it! We had met some fellow Americans too, a group of college-aged girls staying at our hotel. I had talked to two of them quite a bit, a blonde, and an Asian girl with a blue-streak through her dark hair. I also occasionally saw them hanging out with this hot older guy, and this young, black-haired girl with huge knockers, but I hadn't met them yet. I was hoping to close the deal with them pretty soon, hopefully all three of the girls, and certainly give Paul a night he would never forget. 3 

===

So, right now, I was lying on a beach in Brazil, my hot body getting perfectly sun-kissed. I was topless, hoping to give my tits the tan they deserved. I had a powder blue thong barely covering my lower half, fitting right in with all the Brazilian sluts strolling down the beach, looking positively filthy. I looked down, seeing some good color on my chest, so I opted to turn back over onto my belly. I lied there, getting a tan, waiting for my man to return. 

I spied Paul approaching, looking sexy, his tanned upper half looking better than ever, and his stylish board shorts helping him fit right in on the beach. I got up on my elbows, glancing at my nails as I felt him approach. My lower legs were pointed upward, kicking up in the air lightly as I lied here. I smiled as I felt his lips kissing up my leg and up to my round butt, focusing on my exposed ass for a few moments. Paul loved the thongs I wore. He couldn't get enough. Like I told Andrea, he had REALLLY been on my ass lately. He kissed up my back before reaching my ear. 

"I could ravage you right now," he growled, causing me to shiver. I turned and gave him a soft kiss. 

"Your wife called," I reported, causing him to sigh. 

"Did she suspect anything?" he asked. 

"Your wife... ha! I don't think so!" I replied, causing him to laugh. It was true. She was pretty fucking dumb. It couldn't be more obvious me and Paul were fucking, but she didn't catch onto a thing. She called so many times to the office while I was working my magic. He would talk to his wife while balls deep in my tight cunt, barely able to cover his grunts. I would chat to Andrea while her husband was lovingly rimming my ass. And I had fucked Paul at his house as well, in his home office, and his dumb wife didn't ask any questions when me and her husband spent an hour locked away together. She had fucking cooked me dinner, helping me recover after draining her husband's balls, not noticing her husband's wandering eyes staring into my cleavage, not noticing my foot under the table, teasing him, making him hard for me again. I had stolen her man, and she loved me. She thought of me as a friend now, with no idea I had been fucking her man. She trusted me to take care of Paul and do good work, and boy was I doing a good job. I laughed to myself. In the four months I had been working with Paul, with all the travel we were doing, all the hard work, I probably spent more nights in bed with him than his wife did. Paul clearly valued his work wife more than his actual wife. 

I knew at this point he was more my man than hers. I had changed him to the point where he got off as much as I did on sneaking around behind his wife's back, humiliating her in the process. One night, after him and his wife had been away at some family function, he called me late at night, just before him and his wife were going to bed. They had been so busy that they hadn't had much in the way of private time together, so one they got home, sex was on the table. Finding that an unappealing prospect, he had me sneak into the house, into the bathroom, where I proceeded to drain his balls into my tight, waiting cunt. He gave me a loving kiss, and I knew that he wanted to make sure he gave me his best, and leave whatever was left for his wife. 

Andrea never caught on, and we were too hot for each other that we weren't as secretive as we could have been. I fucked him on his marital bed SO many times, and for a moment, it almost felt like I was actually his wife, and for a slut like me who had never really considered settling down, I found the idea surprisingly appealing. Whenever I was around Andrea, I would find myself eyeing that expensive ring on her finger. 

But like I said, even though we were pretty sloppy in covering our tracks, Andrea never figured it out. I had a bad habit of losing my underwear whenever I spent time at his home, but Andrea never seemed to find any of them. And, oh... OH YEAH! The absolute best part was that Andrea, this smart, brilliant, educated woman never caught on... but her housekeeper did. Rosa wasn't exactly a keen, brilliant mind, but she clearly wasn't completely clueless. Whenever I'd visit, she'd give me dirty looks, and it became clear to me that she had figured it out. That she knew exactly what me and Paul were doing together. Knowing this could be a complication, I had to think fast, and I had come to an absolutely brilliant solution. 

So, yeah, me and Paul had a threesome with Rosa. I know, right? Crazy! And honestly... it was pretty fucking good. Yeah, Rosa was an older woman, in her forties, and she was a bit thick, but she had a nice body. It was certainly better than Andrea's, as she carried a big round ass and a pair of DD's, and she was actually pretty good looking. Paul had been a bit hesitant about this plan, and Rosa seemed a bit freaked out at first, but once she cooled down, and me and Paul talked her out of her clothes, she warmed up fast. And I have to say, she was surprisingly good. She had curves, sure, but she knew how to work it, and with the fervor she began riding Paul's cock, it became clear that this was something she had wanted to do for a very, very long time. Paul really got into it too, and by the end, Paul and Rosa were flat out going at it! It was fucking hot, an absolute blast to watch. Sweat from her thick, juicy body was seeping into the bedsheets as she was energetically drilled by her employer's hard cock. And the moment when Paul filled her grasping, loving cunt with his thick seed, she was officially on our side, and not on Andrea's. I think, like us, she took pride on getting one over on the naïve woman of the house. 

And having Rosa helping us out proved useful, as she was happy to help cover our tracks, preventing Andrea from catching on, in exchange for the occasional helping of thick married cock, which Paul was happy to oblige. When Paul and I were fucking in his home office, Rosa would keep Andrea distracted. When Paul and I would leave the bedsheets an absolute mess, Rosa would dutifully wash them, except, of course, Andrea's pillowcase, which would be left as is, soaked from the sweat of my ass, the juices from my cunt, and the cum from her husband's dick. All of us thoroughly enjoyed the fact that poor, naïve Andrea would rest her head on this evidence of her husband's betrayal and be none the wiser. We all loved rubbing it in her face. Whenever I had to chat up Andrea when I was over at their place, I would look over her shoulder and see Paul feeling up Rosa, squeezing her big boobs, showing his appreciation for all her hard work. This was the guy I had turned Paul into. A guy who fucks his forty- something housekeeper to make sure his wife doesn't catch on to his indecent affair. I had truly drawn Paul down to my level. I loved it! 

I was drawn back to my current state, lying hear on the beach, Andrea's husband's hands touching my body. Mmmmm, all these happy memories, plus Paul's loving touch, were making me very wet. I swear I was gonna soak through my fucking thong. 

"Did you forget my drink?" I asked, looking up at Paul. 

"You know I can't do that..." he said with a laugh, sliding down next to me, putting his arm over me and pulling me into him. I was now on my side as he spooned up behind me, the intimate position we often ended up in when we slept together. His hand slid over my breasts, squeezing them lightly before sliding down to my belly, sliding against the small baby bump forming there. 

"Feel your baby, Paul..." I sighed, "Feel the child you put in your slut's belly." Paul felt my pregnant belly up, as he loved to do. I could feel how hard his massive cock was getting against my ass. 

"I could take you here..." he whispered, kissing my ear. 

"Sounds good to me..." I sighed, my nipples tightening. 

"Let's go back to the room," he growled. "I can't wait another minute." I turned to look at him. 

"You got it boss." 

Paul led me down the sandy beach towards our hotel, his hand around my hips. His eyes barely left my bouncing, rippling tits as I sashayed down the beach, looking to all outsiders like the beautiful, happy, sexy couple. And in this sea of beautiful bodies, all eyes were seemingly on me. These gorgeous men, these sexy Brazilian women... it seemed as if none of them could keep their eyes off my bouncing tits. I was the center of attention, as I should be. 

Any annoyance I had once felt for Paul had been totally replaced with lust. Attraction. He had acknowledged his act, kept it up for others, but only I knew his secret. His true self. He had given everything up for me. He had bent his whole life backwards for me. I dare say he was obsessed with his little slut. And that obsession was mutual. I couldn't get enough of him. He was the best, dirtiest, most sexy boyfriend I could ever ask for. My lust for him had been well founded and it was paying off in spades. 

Like I said, Paul and I were a dangerous team. When we were together, we could do some damage, as the bed in our executive suite could attest. I could see the future now. In a few years, at the rate Paul was climbing, the company would be his, and I would be by his side. A multi-million dollar company run by my man. The man who I controlled. The man who was obsessed with me, and would give me whatever I wanted. So much power. So much money. So much sex. And it was all mine. It would all be mine. 

Cause even though the company would be under his guidance, it would be me who was truly in charge. I loved the sound of that. I had shown a clear aptitude for how business should be done, and the company would benefit from my wisdom. We'd have to push out the old guard first, including Paul's father-in-law, the big boss. I could be patient, and wait, but when the time came, I expected Paul to willingly and brutally push his father-in-law out of his own company. And maybe, just maybe, if we'd had enough fun at Andrea's expense by that point, we might finally push her out of the picture too. And then it'd be me and Paul, together on top, King and Queen, where we belonged. 

I'm pretty sure my juices were dripping down my leg at this point. 

The thought of making all the rules, being totally in charge, was absolutely intoxicating. When I'm in charge, I'll give this company the face-lift it needs. I will modernize our practices. I would stock our bullpen full of sluts like me, because as I've made clear, real business is conducted between the sheets, and we needed the best and brightest young sluts working for us. We would scour the best colleges, the Ivy League schools, the local bars and strip clubs, wherever. If there was a good slut on the market, she needed to be on our payroll. And I had already begun this process, making a few phone calls, recommending a few of my skanky friends for some cushy, corporate positions. And plus, our international contacts, women we've won over, like Carolina, I could see all of them happily playing ball with us. This company's hopes and profit margins were riding on my hot ass, and the sky was limitless. 

I was finally getting the life I deserved. As I felt Paul's arm around me, and his child growing in my belly, my bank account overflowing with cash... I couldn't have possibly been more satisfied. I was completely and utterly content. 

My future was looking bright.
