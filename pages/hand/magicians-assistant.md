===

Alice was humming a cheerful little tune while cleaning the house, pleased to be adrift in the usual routine of household chores. While vacuuming the bedroom the machine bumped something under the bed and to her surprise it was a sex manual. It was obvious who had left it there and the thought of him, as though she could forget for one moment, brought a sly grin to her face. "My young lover." She murmured happily. 

Across the bedroom was a gilt framed mirror reflecting a full-length image of a pretty young housewife in a short flared dress. Such a luxurious home should have a maid she thought, "and I'm it. Perhaps I should get a naughty uniform." She giggled out loud. Bending slightly revealed stocking tops with a glimpse of suspenders just as he liked them. It sent a thrill through her knowing she was dressing just for him. 

Opening the book she flicked through the opening pages glancing at tasteful illustrations then paused in thought. Starting from the beginning they seemed to be in the same sequence as his demands upon her over the last three weeks. 

It was a little disconcerting to find he was using this book as a guide to her body, as though it were an owner's manual. Though in one sense her young lover had become just that, the owner of her body. It was true she conceded, with a lascivious grin creasing her cheeks into glowing red dimples, he did own her body. He was leading her into more adventurous play in the bedroom and taking over more of her life. 

Sitting on the edge of the bed carefully turning the pages over one at a time, nodding occasionally at what was evidently a template of their performances together was bringing uncomfortable ideas onto her head. 

He was using her body as a learning device. She was his doll to be manipulated to his amusement. Alice giggled at the idea. This was a guide to her satisfaction too. The delicious activity of last night was displayed eliciting a shiver of delight at the memory. It was eerie knowing she had been performing to the dictates of this sex manual. "So what is it tonight I must perform?" She whispered. The next page would reveal the latest episode of the mischievous game but should she leave it as a surprise? 

She couldn't resist it. Turning the page, taking a peek at what he would be submitting her to that evening was a shock. "No! I won't do that. I've let him do what ever he wanted but not that." She gasped, slamming it shut without reading a word. The sordid illustration said it all, that she would be submitted to something so awful could not be accepted even with the excuse of being hypnotised. Looking across the king size bed she caught sight of the clock radio. Panic set in as the time registered, five, zero, zero. It left only six minutes to escape the house before he arrived. 

With a coat, keys and handbag she was ready to flee her own home. The phone rang and without a thought reached for it sweeping it under her long dark hair to automatically quote her own number as so many times before. The innocent routine yielded a tragic significance as she heard him utter the well-used indomitable phrase. 

He added the instruction. "I'll be late. Not long. Wait on our favourite sofa for me. Just sit there and think about our sessions together." 

She wandered into the lounge to plonk her body wearily onto the sofa. Sitting there thinking fast she thought to get up and run to the back door. "Lock the damn door before he arrives." She thought, but it seemed such a difficult task to rise out of the seat as though attached to it with limbs heavy from fatigue. Anger became fright at the loss of control finding it really wasn't possible to move. He told her to sit on the sofa until he arrived and despite the need for escape that is what she must do. It was so humiliating to be this helpless yet she couldn't become angry with anyone but herself. This predicament was of her making. 

Alice perched on the edge of a sofa waiting in trepidation. The luxurious lounge had suddenly become a trap, a cage, waiting for her nemesis. Under the influence of a deep hypnotic command all she could do was sit and wait for the young man with his horrid plans for this evening. Giving up the physical struggle to break free she took a deep breath to calm a tortured mind. This dreadful situation was her own fault and no one would set her free so it was up to her to find some way out before he arrived. She sat trying to be calm, trying to think it through, back to how it had all started, seeking a clue as to how she might break free. 

*** 

Her husband had taken care of organising the home and business until he had passed away over a year ago with a premature heart attack leaving her well off but lonely for company. It didn't take long to realise how helpless she was without him, since he had made all the decisions, organising her as well as everything else in their lives. 

As a dark haired beauty of thirty-four, looking young enough to pass for late twenties, there had been too much interest from suitors. Or should she say lechers. She just hadn't felt ready and besides she hadn't much experience of the dating game having married young. 

It put her off more than anything that they were more interested in the inheritance from husband and parents than getting to know her. When she kept quiet about the inheritance others seemed to assume she was desperate for a sexual relationship without a man to take care of her. What she wanted was a relationship, not just sex. They talked to her breasts or asked her to wear shorter skirts to show off a pair of long legs. In reaction she dressed more modestly to hide the voluptuous body until it became a habit, leaving her looking dowdy. It was easy to hide away concentrating on the home in a friendless city they had moved to just before he died. 

That was the foundations of her fall but it all started when Alice befriended the neighbour's shy young son. He was helping with gardening chores when a mutual loneliness brought them closer together. He was only seventeen with little experience of girls and she had felt safe with him. The two of them sought an uncomplicated relationship becoming good friends, able to talk and laugh together. It wasn't his fault but the seeds of her destruction had started then. 

*** 

While waiting for his pay Robert practised a magic trick on the kitchen table. "Well that's marvellous." She applauded. "You should put on a show." She laughed. His embarrassed murmurs had touched the past, an awkward youth still within her, enough to want to help him overcome his youthful awkwardness. He reluctantly agreed and they settled into a routine of shows until one evening he asked her to join him as his assistant. With a newfound confidence he asked if he could hypnotise her. She readily agreed knowing it would add to his growing self-assurance. Helping him along she pretended to be hypnotised while performing a series of silly harmless stunts. 

Not feeling any different when supposedly hypnotised she had to remember not to let the fa√ßade slip until it became a well-rehearsed performance. Not only is it doing the lad a favour she genuinely enjoyed the shows and his company as a pleasant diversion in a boring life. 

"Why don't you invite a couple of your friends along to watch the show? Your pretty good at these tricks now, especially the disappearing egg trick. I still don't see how you do it!" She cheerfully encouraged him. They had practised before an empty sofa since she became a part of the show and thought it might help him make friends. 

Robert invited four friends from the office to watch a performance, which wasn't going too well until the finale when he hypnotised her. They thought it hilarious, especially when taking turns commanding her to be a puppy, a penguin and the usual harmless performances seen in any stage act. Finding it funny too she waddled around the room flapping imaginary wings making them laugh. Seeing his confidence soar among friends reminded her of a not too distant shy adolescence, spurring her on to throw herself into the performance for him. She too enjoyed their attention. 

*** 

She saw it more clearly now. She had dressed in a white blouse and black skirt with seamed stockings to add a little glamour to the act but that was before they had arrived not knowing they were older than Robert. They ordered her to crawl along the floor to them and patted her head and stroked her long hair telling her, "You're a good puppy." The beginnings of something more serious were in mind when one of them patted her bottom but before it got out of hand Robert calmed the situation down by finishing the act. 

That was it she said out loud. "I enjoyed someone else taking control, telling me what to do. I enjoyed entertaining. But surely I could have stopped performing if it went beyond my limits." She continued rolling through the scene of that evening hoping for a clue as to why, later, she had given in so completely. 

*** 

The friends had departed when Roberts' older brother entered the lounge. "Mum wants you home now, Bobby." 

Robert was surprised to see his brother James and for him it was an unwelcome intrusion. Alice walked into the lounge with a coke for Robert while he packed up the equipment. 

"Hi, Mrs Periman." James said respectfully. "Mum wants Robert home pronto, as he hasn't taken his insulin this evening." 

Completely ignoring James she brushed past him to hand Robert a drink. 

"Robert you know you're not allowed." James hissed at his brother. He looked at Alice standing, waiting for further instructions from the Grand Magician. "Robert isn't allowed sweet stuff Mrs Periman. Mrs Periman?" He looked at his young brother whispering, "What's wrong with her Bobby." 

Robert stood in the dinning room where they held the magic shows with a grin upon his face. His colleagues had left but he always waited to the last minute before giving the final instruction to his assistant that would break the spell. "Alice the Glorious is under hypnosis." He casually told his brother while packing the props away, glad to note he was suitably impressed. It was impossible to hold back now so he added; "She is under my control until I give the command to release her." 

After a moment or two James whispered with incredulity, "You hypnotised her?" 

Continuing to pack, Robert kept him waiting savouring the moment. "Yes. It's part of my magic act. The finally." 

Alice enjoyed seeing him swell with pride at being able to impress James. He was only two years older but the contrast between them was greater, perhaps from Robert's illness. James was a fully mature young man with a presence in the room neither James nor his friends had. Seeing Robert with is brother showed how much he had come out of himself, gaining enough confidence to be able to put on a show before work mates and now impressing his brother. "Alice, get a coke for James." Robert commanded her as a demonstration to his brother, showing off his talent. 

With a glass in hand, James asked, "Can I get her to do something?" 

Robert noticed James sheepish manner, taking it as recognition of his skill, so naturally Robert nodded his head, as though granting a favour in sharing a little of this power over an adult. 

James, confronted by an unusual situation, wondered what to do with her. 

Robert saw his brother's bemusement, so for once he would guide him. "Anything. Say anything you like and she will do as you say." 

James smiled a secret little smile at having such authority over an adult. It should have alerted her to the danger, but she felt obligated to her prot√©g√© and knew she was safe in his presence. "Sit!" James spoke with emphasis accompanied by an unnecessary exaggerated movement of his hand, as though training a dog. 

Surprised, he watched as she sat on the floor right before him with her skirt up showing a lot of leg and the little white triangle of her panties. He hadn't meant her to sit right there, thinking she would have chosen a chair. In trepidation at what he had made her do he raised his voice, "Stand up! Stand up, and - walk over here." He was intimidated by the close presence of a mature woman as though she would at any moment wake to become an irate neighbour, annoyed with him. 

Alice thought his face an amusing picture of astonishment after Robert and she had become so used to the act, even blas√© after so long practising it. 

"Oh! No! I was supposed to bring you back quickly. You had better run. Now Bobby!" James told him. "I'll bring your stuff, oh, what do I say to bring her round?" 

Robert whispered in his ear and ran off through the kitchen to the back door amused at his brother's consternation. 

*** 

Alice shuddered with the memory of that moment when she made a sudden and fateful decision. Hearing the back door slam the decision had to be made whether to reveal, or not, the hypnosis was just an act. Knowing it would open Robert to ridicule from his brother, knocking his confidence back, she decided to play along with the game. 

Pretending at being hypnotised a little longer than usual would be no great difficulty as she had mastered the act to perfection over the last few weeks. Alice stood in the middle of the room waiting for him to utter the phrase of release. Instead he ordered her to perform the usual silly tricks, which was amusing knowing that people had little imagination when confronted with an unfamiliar situation, they seemed to think along the same lines. She was even a little proud of how well she had mastered the act; able to convince anyone she was in a hypnotic trance. 

Standing patiently before him awaiting the next command, he said quietly, "Kiss me." 

Taken by surprise she kissed his lips as though it were just another silly trick. "Kiss me again." He told her. This time his tongue freely explored her mouth. It was time to stop the game. Passionate kissing hadn't been a part of her life in such a very long while it had brought on long forgotten feelings which she didn't need right then. 

*** 

On the sofa she remembered how easy it had been to just let it happen. It was all so nice and seemed perfectly harmless to let him be a little naughty. If it had ended there no harm would have been done. 

*** 

Between snatched breaths the words to stop are allusive and to her surprise, she was enjoying it rather too much. The older brother looked more mature but surely still too young to take on an experienced woman. She decided it wouldn't be too difficult to control a young inexperienced man, perhaps a little embarrassing, but how far could he go with this? In any case she could always put a stop to it for she wasn't really hypnotised. 

It had been such a long time since experiencing such earnest passion so why not enjoy it while it lasted. His kisses reach deep feelings where she became lost to the moment unaware of anything around her. Despite the inexperience she was enjoying a rough handling. Considering this obvious inexperience for a moment, she decided it was safe to leave him in charge, to let go. Besides how could she tell him it was just an act after letting him kiss her like that? 

A moments respite gave a chance to snatch a hurried breath. They had, while in an impassioned embrace, travelled across the room with his arm squeezed about her waist as though dancing until they slide down upon the sofa. She landed with his hand under her bottom. Desperately thinking of a way out she decided to pretend to come to before things went too far. A moment longer perhaps for after all his hand held her bottom only to prevent her sliding onto the floor. 

Lost in a dreamy pleasure for more minutes of rapturous petting she gave up trying to think becoming overwhelmed with the emotion of being wanted. Too long without even the slightest loving touch brought on a powerful longing for a man's caress. With eyes closed she let him kiss her until shock exploded them wide. She watched in astonishment his lips close upon a nipple. Wide-eyed she watched in amazement an engorged nipple sucked into his mouth. How did that happen? She hadn't felt him open the blouse or pull her bra down. 

It would be impossibly embarrassing to tell him she had willingly let him do this to her just to protect his brother. The sensations were overpowering allowing her to surrender to this rough handling of her body. She watched in fascination his earnest concentration sucking on a breast. Balanced on top of the bra they point up proudly, as though prepared especially for his attention, where he rubbed them, kneaded them, between finger and thumb, the other being almost sucked off. 

With one hand he pulled her onto his lap where she quietly waited for him to finish with her breasts still at a loss as what to do or say. It should have been predictable, as most men were attracted to those large soft pillows of breasts. She again closed her eyes while he wrapped his arms around her cupping both of them, working them into a taught accumulation of sensations. It had all gone too far to reveal she was willingly allowing him to use her body and in any case reasoning had given way to blissful pleasure. 

It was impossible not to respond to the intense stimulation, yet she must not do or say anything to encourage him, as though her compliant body were not all the encouragement he needed. Like a rag doll she bent at the waist as he pulled her back readjusting her tightly onto his lap. She felt his hardness sliding between soft thighs, unnerved for a moment at being wet and slippery, ready for him. With the last of any resistance gone she yearned for him to find her, wanting him to ram home deeply, to fulfil a desperate longing. Now she understood clearly what it is to ache for a man. Arching back to push him fully home a guttural moan escaped her throat. He was unaware of anything but the muscle gripping his cock. 

*** 

This was the same sofa where it had happened that first time and she was yet again waiting for him to use her body. That first time she must have been under the influence of Roberts' hypnosis not realising it, mistakenly thinking it was just an act. 

She had for several weeks willingly submitting to it, even enthusiastically pressing her mind into it. "Perhaps I must tell myself I don't need a man to command me, would that be a way out. The pleasure he gave me kept me tied into the hypnotic state, under his control. It was what I wanted even needed. The excuses for not breaking free of him, were they mine or did the hypnotic state prevent me from resisting? This time he is going too far. Perhaps I can resist him if he tries to get me to perform something I find so aberrant." She broke off speaking to herself unable to mention the disgusting act he had planned for her. She began to think about the following day, hoping for a clue as to why she continued to let him use her body. 

*** 

The following day, while cleaning the house, she tried to think through the consequences of giving in to James, wondering what the neighbours would think if he began bragging about the conquest to his friends. For it would surely be spread about by the neighbourhood gossips. The memory of him making love to her the night before led to a feeling of excitement. She had to suppress the feelings saying out loud, "It can't happen again. I won't let him use me like that its wrong." She spoke the words attempting to sound confident. The mischievous feelings would have to be suppressed, as she would need a clear head to resist him. 

That evening she told Robert they couldn't practise the act. "It's some boring figures I need to get back to the accountant. They will take a while and must be done. Sorry, Robert." She apologised on seeing his shoulders droop. 

A little later James appeared in the kitchen as expected looking more dejected than his brother had on finding she isn't in the trance he hoped for. Did he realise how horny she felt on seeing him remembering how he had taken her. Even the unspoken, unfamiliar wicked word, horny, was a turn on. The feelings had accumulated all day becoming almost overwhelming yet she dare not reveal anything of the turmoil coursing through her body.  

===

He looked worried so perhaps he was there for reassurance that there wouldn't be repercussions. He needed to know that she was unaware of what had happened. In ignorance he didn't realised a man couldn't take a woman without her knowing, from the results of his passion if nothing else. Even if she had been ordered to forget, which he had neglected to do! 

"Your brother was here earlier but we couldn't practise tonight. He's probably at home now." She said, hoping he would just go. Embarrassment was one of the emotions she felt strongly. How would it be visiting her neighbour, seeing him there knowing what they had done together unable to acknowledge it. Like now it felt awkward. So intimate yet so distant. 

He murmured something then blurted out the phrase his brother used to hypnotise her. She stood rigid in fright. Not knowing what to do or say trying to gather her wits enough to stop him. Should she ignore this gambit or ask him what he meant? If she did that would he suspect she had been a willing victim? 

He leaned close and kissed her lips probing deeply as she compliantly opened them for what she thought to be an intrusion while her body accepted him as a welcome relief. Thinking about it all day had not helped rather it had brought her to a state of overwhelming longing. This time he knew he could do whatever he wanted with her so there were to be no silly games. 

"Take off your clothes." He ordered. 

The exclamation, 'No!' froze in a constricted throat as she saw he had opened her blouse while kissing revealing her breasts. Again she wondered how that had happened, not aware of it while submitting to his caresses. Too embarrassed to tell him anything she submitted to the power he held over her. Whether it was hypnosis or his power to satisfy her body, the question had become irrelevant. The fear of her own collusion was as great as the fear of what he might do to her. She loosened the skirt for it to fall around her feet. 

Looking over his shoulder at the refrigerator, not daring to look him in the eye, she endured the assessment of her body. Her large breasts were flowing over the bra pulled low with only her panties still in place. Unable to move, not even to cover her sensitivity, she suffered silently the animal like snorting as though he were a bull preparing to rut. 

He moved in and turned her from him bending her over the table where he rutted like an animal. He helped himself to her body for his own pleasure. At last he came. 

Alice felt degraded. Her mind cast itself adrift from her body which continued to pulse in rhythm until the moment of completion when all conscious thought was lost to a shattering climax. No preparation was needed, her body had been ready, only her mind had held out but this too gave way under the onslaught of passion. 

He satisfied his need with a compliant female body and lay upon her, deflated. Within moments he had recovered enough to look around the ordinary kitchen in wonder at what he had done. He hadn't planned on just walking in and fucking Mrs Periman in her kitchen. She was his mothers neighbour, almost a friend. He had planned on taking her into the lounge and leading up to it gradually in case, well, he hadn't thought it through properly. Seeing her standing there naked and vulnerable had overwhelmed him. He just had to have her. 

"Get dressed and continue with what you were doing." He told her. 

As furtively as he had entered the kitchen he was gone. Not thinking to tell her to forget what had happened or see that she had recovered he left her leaning over the table glowing hot from the exertion. 

Lying across the table with knickers loose around her knees she realised the truth no longer able to deny it. There was nothing she could do but obey his commands. The awful truth finally sank in. She knew without doubt the hypnosis was real with her own body colluding to satisfy a physical need. A sense of relief flooded her mind; she hadn't allowed him to take her there hadn't been a choice. The thought seemed to clear all resistance from her conscience. Before leaving he ordered her to be ready for him tomorrow and that she knew was what she would be, ready for him. A thrill coursed through her body and mind as she realised how completely under his control she had become. 

Next morning she still wanted to give in but she told herself it was wrong, it must stop. She must not let him in next time he called. She locked the doors only opening them when she knew who was calling. 

A few days went by without seeing him and she wondered if he had shocked himself into staying away or had grown tired of the game he was playing, perhaps he had met a girl his own age. On hearing the back door open she ran to the bathroom locking the door behind her leaning on it breathing heavily in panic. She had forgotten to lock the back door. "I can't live like this it's too ridiculous, too dangerous. One moment I want him the next I'm living in fear of what he might do to me next." She heard the distant sound of the back door closing and taking a deep breath clasped her arms about her body preparing to run to the door and bolt it. 

In the kitchen behind her the dreaded phrase was said entering her mind freezing her in place unable to reach the door, too late anyway. She stood in fright trembling. He had tricked her so stupidly she wanted to weep and stamp her feet in frustration. 

"Go to the bedroom." He said. A simple no nonsense command full of the promise of what was to come. In the bedroom she stripped to stand before him naked. Surprisingly she found the look of approval a relief as though a test had been passed. She knew this time there would be no quick relief of base needs this would be a more serious adventure for him. 

"Lie back on the bed. Open your legs. Turn over." He commanded again and again. Compliant as a well-trained bitch she presented her body for his examination like a docile pet. There was nothing subtle to these commands leaving her feeling humiliated. On hands and knees on the bed she felt his gaze upon her body as though he were stroking her flesh. The goose bumps raised were from fear or the excitement of anticipation, she just couldn't tell which. 

Feeling him at last gently slide into her body a breath rent itself from between her lips. With each thrust her body responded pushing back wanting more, gripping tight onto the pulling stroke not wanting to let go. Feeling the urgency then a final spurt of power taking him to the finishing line brought her climax and completion. Lying there sated, in a glow of sublime pleasure, she realised it had never been like this before, ever. No wonder she couldn't resist, she didn't want to.  

===

Rocking gently on the sofa she wondered at how stupid she had been to allow it to continue. Enthusiastically she had thrown herself into a state of hypnosis for Robert to take control. All right she hadn't guessed she was actually hypnotised at the time but later. Later she did know and simply gave in. After several weeks of hypnosis it had been too easy for James to take advantage of her in this vulnerable state, and in any case, some part of her had wanted it. Letting it continue, letting it grow more powerful, until now it seemed she was lost, utterly lost to the need that kept her trapped. 

Alice remembered how every evening James played with her, becoming bolder, trying something new each session. Each day she would anticipate with a little thrill of excitement what she might have to do next to please him. The very thought that he was using her like some plaything had been exciting and knowing she was hooked on his visits wanting them to continue failed to frighten any longer. She had no responsibility for what happened since becoming this young mans experimental doll to be played with, enforced to do just whatever he wanted. 

In detail she dragged the memories into pictures seeing how he graduated from roughly taking her to a more sensitive lovemaking. He paid attention to her breasts stroking and teasing them. Reliving the delicious strokes upon her thighs even now was stimulating. 

He began trying different positions and she had to admit she too was learning something new. At first it had been appalling having his used cock wiped across her lips and commanded to suck it. Drawing it into her mouth to clean it after making love had soon become a usual routine until she became expert enough to arouse him for another session. 

The first time it happened was demeaning, feeling his come dribble down her throat. At that moment she really did feel like a sex doll, some cheap blow up thing bought from a sex shop to be molested. It was the feeling of disappointment, knowing she wasn't going to come, that shook her. It brought home the debased state she had sunk to. 

Either he guessed how dependent upon him she was or just decided to use her body in another experiment. He had her lie back on the bed with legs stretched out playing with swollen lips while he watched closely until she masturbated to an orgasm. At first she was privately and silently mortified only to become lost in a slow progressive culmination of passion forgetting he was even there. 

As time went on he became more expert at foreplay teasing her to great desperate highs then stop the teasing watching her quiver in delight. The frustration of being unable to grab a hold of him combined with the misery of the sordid state he had reduced her to ground her mind down to such a base state she was ready to do anything for him. 

It was obvious he found it amusing and fruitful to have her excited and enthusiastic. He took greater pleasure from having not just a compliant doll but having an excited bitch ready to buck and grind upon him. It hadn't occurred to her to question where this newfound knowledge was coming from accepting it as a natural course of a young mans experimentation. 

Now she knew. The book had been used as an instruction manual to a body that was just an object to be manipulated, adjusted, fiddled with until it was perfectly attuned to his needs. 

*** 

Still sitting on the sofa she heard him enter the kitchen. So it was too late to find a way out of this mess. At that moment a mortifying thought washed over her. It wasn't her need to find an escape route that made her think through the last few weeks. It had been his command to do just that. Was she that far gone, that much under his control, like a trained bitch always ready and willing. Shuddering she tried to put it out of her mind. "Just get through this evening." She told herself. 

In the bedroom he noticed the book fallen to the floor open at the page that had frightened her so. He picked it up putting this together with the fact she had a coat and handbag and car keys with her on the sofa. He looked at her again seeing she had been about to flee when he called. 

"That first evening I hadn't thought to order you to forget anything. When you avoided me it confirmed you remembered what we did so I planted some hidden commands." He said, while she undressed. 

With growing anxiety she wondered what he was hinting at. She stood waiting for the next command. 

"Off to the bathroom then, quickly." 

She ran back to the bedroom mortified at having to fetch what was to be an important part in this new degradation. It was an added insult that she was going to prepare herself for this depraved act. 

"Rub it in. That's it, work it in well." He told her. 

Tears welled up threatening to spill over reddening cheeks; only he wouldn't see them while bent over the chair presenting her rear. Working the grease into her bottom she regretted not having worked harder to resist him at the beginning until now it was too late, there was nothing she could hold back from him. She felt his hardness press against her tight opening desperately trying to relax the muscle. With relief she felt him enter, the head of his penis at last seeming to pop in. He held it there as though taunting, demonstrating his power over her. 

'Get on with it. Just do it and get it over with.' She thought. 

With careful deliberation learnt from experience over the last weeks he held back. Gently he pushed forward into her little by little, prolonging the pleasure of her tight arse until he was buried deep. Holding there for a moment the movement began in reverse. Inevitably the movements became more excited until she too became overcome by physical urges. 

They lay together with his head on her breasts, both wrapped in each other's arms. She wished she were no longer tied by his commands, only now it was so that she could caress him of her own free will. She had born the ordeal, it hadn't been so painful after all. She even found some satisfaction from it. 

The hidden instructions to obey and enjoy his demands weren't the only reason for thinking such thoughts. She wasn't aware of a need for submission, to have someone dominant over her, but it was there, subtly influencing right from the first. 

The book had been moved from temptation and anyway she no longer wanted to know what humiliation she was to be subjected to when it was impossible to resist. 

During next days chores the occasional twinge reminded her of the base act she had been submitted to until eventually the house was tidy and there was no excuse to put off yet another forbidding task set by her young master. She would have to go as commanded but where she went hadn't been specified so she drove out of town far enough away that no one she knew would see her. 

Entering the store she felt frightened wondering what they would make of her. "I've come to buy something." She said, to a disinterested sales assistant. He just looked at her seeing a bored housewife afraid to look around in case she saw something exciting. 

"Like what?" He said casually without the slightest intention of being helpful. 

Not looking at him she murmured. "Clothes. I have to buy underwear. Other things." She thought he wasn't going to speak as she hung on in embarrassment. 

"Have a look round then. See something you like, call me if you need help." 

Feeling stupid she passed the magazines and bookshelves blurring into massed flesh colours until one came into focus. It was the same book she had discovered under the bed. Passing quickly toward the back of the store she found herself lost in a maze of clothing racks. Against the wall were plastic packages with lurid pictures of the contents. Quickly grasping at a couple, one in red the other in black, she moved on. 

The devices displayed in the cabinet were forbidding. Retreating back to the protection of the clothing racks she hid there wondering what to do, not wanting to seek help for it was too embarrassing. There was no way round it she would have to carry out the command. Bracing herself she sidled up to the counter. 

"A bra and panty set, red, black. Stockings with suspenders, red and black. A transparent dress, baby doll, maid outfit. Any thing else." He asked. He totalled the purchase sounding bored as though it were merely a bag of groceries she had brought to the counter. 

"Yes." She stammered. 

"Well?" He asked. "There's no need to be embarrassed. We get bored housewives in here tying to spice up their marriages all the time. It's good you're making the effort. Well done you. So. What's next? Some cuffs? Some toys?" He said. 

Alice looked over at the display of vibrators unable to say the word. When he walked around the counter toward the cabinet with a key she felt some relief. Perhaps she was in safe hands. The store didn't look the grubby hole she was expecting rather it had a little glamour about it. The best thing was the lack of customers, as she had hoped, this early in the day. 

"Its not just size that matters, so I'm told, it's the shape and the movement. Here, don't be afraid, take a hold of it." He laughed, passing her a large phallus, looking very real and very big. 

Stepping back in anguish, feeling feint, her legs wobbled and she pressed them tight together. This stranger had handed her an evil looking thing that would be used inside her this evening. If she didn't reject it James would be using it on her or commanding her to use it while he watched. The assistant was staring at her, was he imagining this thing disappearing inside her. 

"Are you OK? Do you want to sit down?" He asked with the concern clear in his voice. 

She shook her head in answer trying to clear it too. 

"You need to be sure what you want as we don't take these back. For obvious reasons." He said, continuing to smile attempting to lighten her anxiety. 

Trying to listen she heard some of what he said. It didn't matter about taking anything back for the cost was immaterial but whatever she bought would end up being inserted into her and that was a worry. 

"Well?" He asked. "Do you want it for your pussy or anal?" He repeated. 

Shocked, not at the question but to realise she had no choice but to reveal the nasty truth as James had ordered her to bring back the right things. "I need both. I need something to stretch me here." She whispered plaintively while patting her bottom. 

He looked quizzically at her. Opening a small box he said. "These are graduated, small to large. They're butt plugs." 

Her hand shook too much to take the small box from him so he put them to one side. "I guess you're not used to this sort of thing so I suggest you should start with a small vibrator. Are you sure you don't want to sit down. Here's one with a remote control. Your husband can switch it on over the phone or while you have dinner guests. That should get him going." He said reverting again to a disinterested neutral tone of voice. 

"It's not for my husband, it's for my master." She blurted out only it sounded worse than if he thought she was pandering to a husband. 

"Oh! Well I can show you some slave collars and the rest of the BDSM gear." He volunteered. 

"No! It's not like that." She stopped unsure what he meant but not wanting him to think too badly of her. 

"We're completely confidential here so you can relax, well perhaps not. If you tell me what you are into I can help. You're unusual I must say that. What is it all about then?" He asked. 

"I have to do as I'm told." She started to say. Mortified at the words that revealed the sordid situation, not wanting to tell him, yet blurting it out anyway. "I've been hypnotised to obey someone. I just have to bring back the right things. The things he ordered me to buy. Its in that book." She said nodding to the bookracks. 

He shook his head in disbelief. He had heard some stories but this one was a loony. "Show me the book and we can see what you need." He sighed. 

She watched him wonder through the store picking the items mentioned and illustrated in the book. She wanted to know but was afraid to look. 

"Well that's it. Is there anything else you would like? Something for your self maybe?" He joked. 

"One more thing I have to do. I've been ordered to wear something home." She spoke softly dreading the moment. At least it was easier talking to him now the truth had been revealed. He seemed sympathetic even if he didn't understand. "You can change in there. It's OK. No one will be in at this time of the morning. I'll put the closed sign up if that will make you feel better." 

She took a dress, some underwear and one of the butt plugs, with a nervously shaking hand to the changing room. The arched eyebrow gave him a devilish look, which nevertheless seemed reassuring. 

The booth was large enough to strip off in and she imagined it had to be when someone tried on some of the more complicated outfits. The small curtain wasn't though. Bending over she tried to fit the butt plug only she was nervous unable to relax that muscle. 

"You'll need this." His voice spoke startlingly close behind her. "You OK in there?" He asked. 

A hand appeared around the curtain with a tube of jelly. In fright she remained bent over shivering, both hands gripping the back of a chair looking down at the butt plug on the seat. How the hell did she get here, every day seemed to bring her down to ever more scandalous positions. Hearing him knock on the panel she whimpered. 

"I'm sorry if, well. You can't stay in here all morning I've got to open up." He tried to sound casual. 

She watched him pick up the butt plug and felt his large fingers massage the jelly around her small puckered hole. It was just so sensuous she forgot about the weirdness of it all. Here was a stranger massaging her bottom with grease. She stiffened on feeling a finger enter. 

"Easy, just relax. I'll get it in there and you can be on your way." He soothed. On feeling her relax he tried the butt plug easing it in slowly. He listened to the little sighs she gave judging how far to go then held off allowing her a moment to adjust. "There, all done. I'll wipe off the lubricant as it will show on that dress." 

She felt a cloth wiping her bottom then between her legs, down her thighs. It was sensuous and illicit and naughty and very nice. 

"Here lift a foot. Now the other." 

Feeling the panties being pulled up over her legs was prolonging the sensations. The stockings were a thrill fluttering up each leg to centre delightful sensations between her legs. He fastened the garter belt, adjusted the stockings. Her head swam in delirium. 

"Lift your arms." 

She shook the dress into place with a little shiver of her shoulders and hips. 

"Wow! You look rather different from when you walked in here. I hadn't guessed you were hiding such a figure. It certainly isn't hidden now. Are you sure you want to wear that particular dress home." 

Pleased with his assessment of her body she relaxed a little yet still felt foolish, which was a step up from being ashamed at what she had allowed him to do. He hadn't taken advantage; even helping by dressing her showed he was above the average male, some one to trust maybe. 

"Take small steps, that's it. Are you sure you want to wear that dress outside?" He said holding on to her as she hobbled from the cubicle. Stopping before a mirror he made sure she took a good look at the outfit before leaving the store. 

"Oh!" She exclaimed. "I don't want to but I must. He ordered me to wear the dress I bought, so now I'm stuck with it. I should have taken a better look at it before buying the damn thing." The dress was a short A line design light enough to float around her thighs and higher with the slightest breeze. What it did manage to cover could be seen through the light weave of cotton. The flesh colour bra and panty set de-sexed her giving a wispy look as though she were a nude fairy surrounded by a gossamer mist. 

"Don't stretch too much and try to keep your thighs together. You had better clench your cheeks too." He told her. Receiving a quizzical look he explained. "The bra has peep holes. If you stretch up they will open revealing your nipples. The same goes for the panties. Keep your bottom clenched, as the butt plug will show once your outside in the sun. It will shine right through revealing everything. Don't worry I'll see if the coast is clear and walk with you to your car. By the way my name's Daren." 

Daren hated loose ends they nagged at him. "It can't be right, surely you can't hypnotise someone to do what they don't want to do. Well maybe that's it she does want to be controlled." He said out loud on his way back to the store. Leaving the closed sign up he walked straight out the back door to his own car. 

Alice drove carefully not wanting to attract attention wishing it were dark to avoid even the slightest chance of being seen in the filmy dress. It was more vital not to break hard as every movement brought discomfort from the butt plug. Out of the corner of her eye she noticed a red warning light blink on the dashboard. "Oh! No! Damn it. Damn it. Not now. Please don't let it run out now." 

She imagined having to fill up with fuel bending over showing everything then confronting the man when paying. The alternative was daunting too. Running out of fuel near home walking by neighbours in a dress that revealed her body more than a streetwalker dared to. Either way she faced humiliation maybe even worse if someone decided to take advantage. Keeping her foot light on the pedal she cruised along eking out the last wisp of fuel. 

Resting a weary head in hands upon the steering wheel Alice groaned at yet another foolish predicament thoughtlessness had driven her into. A block away from home and the tank was as dry as her mouth. A rap of knuckles on the glass startled her drying the tears in an instant. 

"Daren!" She exclaimed. 

"You OK?" He asked. "Come on I'll give you a lift." With a wane smile she tried to recover her composure. "I saw the car chugging along until it ran out. Where to?" 

"I'm so glad to see you. There's no one around but I just couldn't face walking the rest of the way dressed like this."  

===

Alice felt safe once the door was shut on the short scurry from the car to her home. It would have been terribly embarrassing if the neighbours saw her wearing the short see through dress. It wouldn't have been fatal but just the thought of how they would gossip about her would have been hard to endure. 

With Daren she felt comforted even though she had just met him. For a fleeting moment she wondered why he had followed in his car but filed the question away, for the moment content to trust her instinct about him. He was a caring individual, which seemed out of keeping with his working in a sex store, or at least, with the image of such a place being sleazy for devious people. 

"Thank you again Daren. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't turned up. I just couldn't have walked the two blocks dressed like this. You are my knight in shining armour." Alice gushed feeling pleased and stupid at getting herself into such a predicament. 

"That's OK. I was worried about you when you left the store. I must admit I'm curious about what you told me. I can hardly believe you have to obey someone like that, to wear that dress home. Yet, there is something going on here. You have a nice home in a good neighbourhood, and you're obviously well off. What's the story?" 

"Would you like tea or a coffee? OK. I'll tell you while making the tea. It would do me good to tell someone." Alice smiled for the first time since meting him. 

In the kitchen she explained how it had all started, so innocently at first, until it got out of control. "I hadn't realised how overpowering the hypnosis had become, I guess it was because I was trying so hard to make it work. I'll be honest with you, I did want to be his, I mean, to let it all happen, at first. Now when I do things I don't know whether it's what I want or what he wants. It's all so confusing." 

Back in the lounge Alice was about to sit when Daren grabbed hold of her arm. "Be careful. Your still wearing that butt plug." 

"Oh! I forgot. I'm still wearing this silly dress too. He ordered me to wear it till he gets here this evening. What if someone calls, I dare not answer the door in this thing." 

"Perhaps that's his intention. My advice, if you want it, is to put a stop to this before it goes too far. What about friends or family, isn't there anyone you can talk to, someone that can help?" Daren asked. 

"No. No one. Thanks for listening that helped. You had better leave I need to prepare for this evening. I'll be OK. I'll see his brother Robert, the one who hypnotised me in the first place and see if he can clear it out of my head. I'll be able to sort it out with James then. Tonight, promise." She emphasised the words on seeing the look of scepticism on Daren's face. "I promise. Tomorrow I'll phone you to let you know how I got on." 

Alice waved goodbye feeling a renewed determination to sort out the squalid game they had been playing. Their chat had put things into perspective and he was right she would have to do something before he started involving others in their private games. 

'Game?' It wasn't a game, but what else could she call it. Before the feeling faded she picked up the phone to speak to her neighbour. "Hi Alice!" Ronda chirped. "Robert is away on a training course and won't be back until the end of the week. Ok! Hone. I'll get him to give you a call." This news dampened her spirits and resolve. So she would have to brave it out this evening without help after all. 

*** 

James arrived on time, as usual, eager to see his plaything. As usual she was swept up in his youthful exuberance forgetting the serious talk she had meant to have with him. 

Standing by the dining table while he hurriedly gulped down the meal should have given her the opportunity to say something in her defence. The sensuous feeling of his hand upon her thighs was so deliciously naughty and distracting the moment for words vanished. It seemed such a devilishly mischievous thing to be serving this young man in her own dining room while he blatantly teased her. 

"I see you carried out my instructions today. Bend forward, let me see your new toy." 

As ordered she bent over the table to show him the butt plug surprised at how used to it and how ordinary it felt to show him. The thought that it had been purchased, this instrument of corruption, with her own money for his enjoyment struck her as another sign of a decent into depravity. Bending over to show him propounded the feeling of addiction to this corruption of her morals. She had lost the will to resist and what was more worrying was the idea that she was losing the resolve to even care about resisting. 

"You can clear away when I've gone. Right now I want you upstairs." 

With a light heart of expectation she scampered up to the bedroom to wait on hands and knees ready for her master. Watching him hurriedly throw off his clothes, trembling with anticipation, Alice wondered what was to be this evening's delightful adventure. It no longer mattered what he demanded, she was willing to submit for the carnal pleasure of it. 

On hands and knees she felt the butt plug being manoeuvred until with a slight resistance it popped out. 

"I see you've managed to work up to a large one during the day. Tomorrow you can keep at it, until the largest fits." James ordered. 

On his knees behind her she felt his penis upright between her cheeks. Raising her bottom to him she sought its head inexpertly attempting to capture it. 

"That's enough. I'm too dry. You'll have to lick it." He told her matter-of- factly as though it were a stamp to be licked. 

He was rigid yet lacking the usual enthusiasm, ready to take her as a matter of course, as a matter of routine. Afraid he was becoming bored with their game she lavishly licked and sucked him not caring if he shot into her face and wouldn't receive what she wanted, where she needed it. Too anxious of losing his interest, of some unrealised danger of punishment, she enthusiastically sucked him into her mouth. Swallowing his cock to the balls she managed what had become, over the last two weeks, an expert technique. 

"Stop that slut. My, you have become an eager cocksucker. Mrs Periman the prim and proper lady next door just can't wait to get on the end of my dick. Well not tonight Josephine, tonight you're taking it up your arse. As you're so eager you can do all the work." 

Lying back on the king size bed he manoeuvred himself into a comfortable position. "You look like a panting bitch on heat woman. Put your tongue back in I have no use for that, for the moment." When he waggled his finger at her she climbed on top facing him. "Find the right hole bitch. That's it, down nice and easy." 

She sat on his cock feeling it rise up her anus until her weight buried it deep. The purpose of the butt plugs was now very evident from its ease of progress. 

"That's good but your still too tight. Your busting my balls, try another hole." 

Without thinking she moved back then bent forward to lick him clean achieving a sigh of pleasure from his lips. Manoeuvring over him once more she settled down driving the precious object deep into her vagina. At last it was where she wanted it. Watching him as a guide to the best rhythm she held him tight with a steady long stroke basking in the look of desire writ large across his face. 

Judging the moment to perfection she thrust powerfully eliciting animal like grunts with every breath from his wide-open mouth. It was time to let go to complete her pleasure too. Throwing back her head she rode him hard with breasts bouncing and mouth wide gasping for breath. At that moment she felt him spurt deep into her belly bringing on a deep and satisfying orgasm shaking her body with tiny tremors. 

Lost in a world of contentment Alice nestled in his arms wanting the moment to last forever. The coarse words were forgotten as once more she bathed in the afterglow of a colossal orgasm. She imagined herself a frail thing protected by her man. Master, owner of her body, whatever he was didn't matter she was his to do with as he pleased. 

"Go and freshen up. You can show me those other outfits you got today." 

Alice scampered to the bathroom excited at the prospect of showing herself off to him, wanting to get back to him instantly. It was unusual for a man to take an interest in a woman's clothing but of course what had been purchased was designed to show off her body for his enjoyment. 

She felt a light slap on the rump as he unexpectedly climbed into the shower with her. Feeling his hands soaping her still erect nipples was a delightful surprise. His hands gently lathered her entire body slipping everywhere. Having learnt about her body from weeks of practise the sensations coursing through her ravaged body were all consuming until consciousness was a mass of tingling nerves replacing rational thought. 

Wrapping her in a huge fluffy towel he pampered her with careful strokes until dry. He carried her back to the bedroom to lay her lightly upon the bed where she floated in a cloud of sensuousness. 

The moments passed with him staring at her with a look of amusement, this too a source of joy. Remembering the order to try on the clothes she rolled off the bed onto the floor and with some effort managed to clamber into the walk in wardrobe. 

Emerging with a flourish Alice twirled the flared dress for it to climb her thighs to reveal black stockings held tight by suspenders. Together with high heels the effect lengthened her legs at the same time making the hem seem more risqu√©. It was no good pulling at it as her breasts would over flow the low cut top. With her breasts pushed into a deep cleavage the image of a naughty French Maid was perfect. 

The glint in his eye was all the encouragement needed. She turned back to the wardrobe and bent straight legged for the duster revealing a pair of black silk panties. Her reward was to see the glint turn to a sparkle. Teasing imaginary cobwebs from high places she pranced around showing a hint of black silk panties and bending to flick at fantasy dust to reveal her pert bottom framed by the suspenders. 

When she lifted a leg before his nose to straighten the stocking seams he interrupted the naughty show. "I can't stand much more without grabbing you. That outfit will be perfect for tomorrow. Just remember your mine. You want to do as I say. You want to make me happy. You need to make me happy. Whatever I want you to do you will obey with pleasure. You will want to do it for me. Now try the others." He ordered, the words impulsively streaming from his mouth. All this was said just as she was devoting herself to him, performing for him, at her most vulnerable moment with the result it effectively entered deeply into her mind. 

*** 

After he left she drifted around the kitchen in a mist of contentment befuddling her mind. With the chores done all that was needed was to retire to bed for a well-earned rest. Before getting into bed she lavished lubricant into the brown puckered hole then fitted the next larger butt plug. A little giggle escaped her lips on thinking this had become another of his pleasure holes. "I'm his pleasure doll she murmured before drifting off to sleep. "Shape to his requirements, for his pleasure." 

*** 

Next morning the promise to Daren was remembered only the significance of it had been lost. Yesterday she had misgivings about giving in to James with the prospect of his demands going too far, as if they hadn't already. This morning such worries had evaporated. She wanted to please James in all things and would try hard to keep him happy. There remained some small nagging feeling that something was wrong when she thought of a promise to Daren but couldn't make sense of it. 

Shaking her head in amusement at such silly worries she decided not to dwell on it, as James would take care of things. Scampering off to the kitchen she opened a cookbook for a recipe to check the ingredients were at hand. It was important to prepare everything for this evening's guests. Remembering how James had liked it she was tempted to wear the maid's outfit while working in the kitchen but couldn't take the chance of spilling something on it. It would be needed this evening while serving his guests.  

===

James arrived on time with Alice waiting patiently. Only a few days ago she had been worried what he might do to her next as each visit meant ever greater humiliations. He was demanding ever more outrageous sexual acts far beyond anything she had ever experienced. 

When he told her casually to obey him with pleasure, she was committed to do just that. It was a casual remark for him but devastating to her. Being hypnotised so deeply for so long the suggestion would now be impossible to resist. So now she had the indignity of waiting upon him, for whatever awful act he intended, with pleasurable enthusiasm. 

His guests arrived while she was in the kitchen readying the dishes of food. When she walked in they were seated around the card table making themselves comfortable in her lounge. All eyes swivelled upon her as though she had made a grand entrance. She had tried to enter unobtrusively and found the attention uncomfortable. 

"Come and meet my friends, Alice." James told her. 

Each one of them studied her like predatory animals. She had the little black dress on as ordered by James, without the extra's that made it into a French Maid's outfit. Nevertheless it was a tease. It was short and low cut. The hem flared out promising a show of stocking tops, perhaps suspenders too. Her breasts were pushed up into an ample cleavage. 

"This is George." She nodded her head at a man who sat comfortably making himself at home. He was the eldest of the trio, about twenty-five and the most self assured. He smiled back at her, flipping a poker chip between his fingers. He had casually tossed an expensive suit jacket over the back a chair and sat nonchalantly studying her. 

"Edward." James said. Edward sat on the edge of the chair shuffling cards seeming more eager to start the game and less interested in her cleavage than the others. 

"Call me Eddy." He said, eyeing her up. He went back to shuffling the cards. He was a slight built man with pointy features. She took a dislike to him immediately. 

"Last but not least, Victor." 

"Victor by name, victorious by nature." The small fat man opined, waving his hand across the table in way of explanation. "Not lucky in love though." He added sourly. He was the youngest apart from James. He looked about twenty but his smooth fat face meant it was hard to tell. 

"How come you have such a beautiful woman providing the food Jimmy?" George asked. The others nodded their heads still admiring her body rather than the food. 

"Alice is looking after me until she's paid back the money she owes. By the way as soon as I get it I'll pay you back." James answered. He swallowed nervously not wanting to get into that subject. He had intended to show off his conquest to George hoping to be taken more seriously and have more time to pay up. 

Alice was nervous, feeling very vulnerable with this group of strangers in her home. When she had agreed to have them here it was under orders from James but confronted with the reality of it, wished it had been possible to refuse. 

He had prompted her more carefully than usual, telling her to act normally yet still obey him. He didn't intend to reveal she was hypnotised but show her off to these men, and that worried her. 

She stood by James waiting to serve them. He slipped his hand up her skirt as a reminder she was his and as ordered she enjoyed the attention. The game went even handed. The drinks flowed and the conversation became more risqu√©. 

"So Alice pays the interest with food and drinks. What else does she have to do?" George asked. The others chuckled at the innuendo. 

"Well. Until she pays me back I own her. That's the arrangement." James bragged. "That's right, isn't it Alice." He added. 

"Yes Sir." She said. It was just two little words said automatically yet so full of meaning she wished it could have been less evocative. As she said the words she felt her face colouring in embarrassment. 

The men chuckled except George. He looked at her seriously. "So you have to do as you're told. You seem to be enjoying it though." He commented. 

Alice wondered if he had noticed James touching her for he had become more careless with each drink. They teased him and made the inevitable remarks about having a beautiful woman as a servant. She felt so humiliated she dare not look at them while serving them. 

"You're running out of chips Jimmy, and credit too. You sure you want to stay in the game?" George asked. The offhanded remark was said trying to make it sound as though it didn't matter to him one way or the other. 

"I'm just starting a winning streak. I'm going to win back what I lost for sure. You've got to let me stay in the game." James pleaded. 

"Well you had better put something real in the pot. No more IOU's. The lady here looks good collateral to me. What about you guys?" He asked, looking around the table. 

His eyes rested on Alice and she would have shouted at him if she could. 'How dare you make such a loathsome suggestion?' She thought. In trepidation she waited on James to say something. The longer the silence stretched the more her fear mounted. 

"Perhaps you were just shooting a line and she isn't as duty bound as you pretend. Perhaps she doesn't owe you anything at all. You owe me though." George chided him. 

"She will do as she's told." James said. 

He had been goaded and responded as predicted. George watched him write her name on a piece of paper. Then added the words: 'Until midnight.' 

"Do you agree?" George asked her. 

Before she could reply James told her. "You will do as you're told. Who ever has the piece of paper will tell you what to do. You will do as they tell you. Do you understand?" he demanded. 

"Yes Sir. I will do as I'm told by whoever has the piece of paper." Her voice trembled but she managed to answer. Her emotions swung from anger to fear. Her knees wobbled almost giving way. So mortified, she felt as though she might fall in a feint. She brought herself under control by reasoning that nothing too bad could happen in just a couple of hours. 

Victor won the pot and the piece of paper: such an insignificant thing yet it held such power. He beckoned her over and asked. "So, you'll do as I say now?" 

"Yes sir." She said, trying to sound confident as though she had some free will left. That she might say 'No', if he went too far. In truth she wondered what too far meant after being hypnotised for so long and for so many heavy sessions. James had pushed her beyond her limits so often she felt totally helpless to resist anything. 

With a laugh he patted her bottom. Unable to run away she stood beside him trying to remain calm. The cards were being dealt and thankfully he needed both hands. She hoped upon hope James would win that damn piece of paper back, and soon. 

With the cards on the table he had a free hand and she felt it wander up her dress. Unable to protest she could only hope he behaved himself before his friends. A finger delved into her panties. She suppressed a shudder not wanting to react at all, not wanting to give him the satisfaction. 

A thick finger slithered across her lips and she winced on feeling how wet she had become. She had been told to be pleased at pleasuring James but not this stranger. It was daunting to find she had become excited. 

"You're doing something right, Victor." George dryly commented. They had all noticed her reaction and guessed what he was up to. 

'They must think I'm a kinky housewife getting her thrills with strangers.' She thought in disgust. 

"Damn. You held the Ace. What a time to lose." Victor told his friend. 

Edward leered at her as she moved to stand by him. He licked his lips nervously. "I need a drink. Put extra ice in mine." He told her. 

"Trust you to think of alcohol." George chided him. 

To prove a point he pushed his hand up her dress. She felt his bony fingers cup her sex. He gripped her there and squeezed. The humiliation was heaped upon her shoulders making them slump with its weight. All she could do was wish for midnight to arrive quickly before she came and made a complete disgrace of herself. 

For the two hours to midnight the three strangers took turns in winning her body. James looked on in disgust at how obviously aroused she had become. He was angry, dismissing the fact it was his responsibility to protect her. 

Midnight arrived and James snatched the note away from George. Alice walked around the table as best she could. The panties had been rolled to one side in a sodden mess. Her lips were swollen and sore from their manipulation of her poor pussy. 

James winning streak hadn't materialised and he was in a huff. 

The others had left except George who looked at the two of them. "So she owes you the money you owe me." 

James nodded not wanting to get into a discussion over this debt. Not now, not tonight. He had too much to drink and was angry with the world for his bad luck. 

"I'll take the piece of paper with me then. That will cancel your debt. She can pay me back direct." George said. 

Alice looked at James with a look clearly pleading for him not to give into the man. 

James tossed the piece of paper across the table. Alice watched George pick it up and casually slide it into his pocket. Her eyes were riveted upon that pocket so terribly afraid of what it symbolised. 

"Just do as you're told." James stated clearly. The idea came to mind that he no longer owed George anything; his debt had been wiped off the slate. He relaxed knowing he was off the hook not caring about Alice. Not at that moment anyway. Perhaps tomorrow he could think it through more clearly. 

James had meant for her to obey George but he hadn't been specific. It struck Alice immediately she had merely been ordered to do as she was told. This had all the makings of a living nightmare. 

*** 

At least he had a nice apartment. She tried to be positive about the situation. There was little to commend it but she would try. If she broke down and cried he was sure to ask what the matter was. She would tell him she was hypnotised and under a deep seated influence to do anything he wanted. She would be in even greater danger then. At the moment he just thought she was a kinky housewife getting a kick out of being submissive. 

"You're very quiet. You didn't even delay leaving that house to get some clothes. The perfect woman! I don't mind if you never repay the debt." He told her. 

'That was the way out of this dreadful situation.' She thought. She would have to find some way to get away from him and send a cheque. She had plenty of money but how would she escape him? 

There must be a way otherwise she might belong to him until he became fed up with her. If the same happened as with James she could end up being passed from stranger to stranger. The prospect of being a malleable slave for the rest of her life was so unbearable she dare not think of it. 

She sat on the sofa watching him fix drinks for them. He was tall with a strong physique but he was definitely not her type. There again nor was James ordinarily. She hoped he didn't have some bizarre fetish that he would expect her to satisfy. 

"It's late and I have an early start tomorrow. So to bed with you wench. You've nothing to wear so you're going to have to sleep with me naked. What do you say to that?" He asked. 

'Damn. Why did everything they say come out as an order? He had just ordered me to sleep with him naked.' She thought. There was only one thing she could say. "Yes sir." Being taken to his bed was of course expected but now the moment had arrived she felt overwhelmed with shame. 

Keeping her head low and hidden in her long hair only reinforced his opinion she wanted to be a submissive. 

He shucked off his clothes and climbed into bed with just a sheet covering him. She had turned away too shy to look. 

Alice was self-consciously removing the dress while he watched. In consternation she hesitated wondering which was more modest, removing the bra or panties first. She was undressing in a stranger's bedroom providing a private strip show. She wanted to scream and run but continued slowly, methodically obeying the command. 

She slid a stocking down a shapely leg and thought he would applaud from his enthusiastic grunts. His breathing was certainly heavier. With her fingers tucked into the edge of her panties she hesitated. Not meaning to make a show of it; just so very nervous before this stranger. 

'Damn it! They had all fingered her like naughty school-boys and he knew it. He was waiting for her knowing she was so very much available.' She thought with anger. 

"Come on in, the bed is warm and I'm hot. No. Climb in at the end." He said, pointing to the end of the bed and lifting the sheet with a foot. 

Slowly she climbed between his splayed legs knowing exactly what to do having perfected the technique with James. 'I'm a professional cock sucker.' She thought in disgust. 'How did I come to this after having such a quiet life? If my husband could see me now he would be furious after all those times I refused him.' She wondered, trying to delay the inevitable. 

She kissed and sucked on his balls then gently manipulated them in one hand while licking the length of his penis. She spit saliva over its head and pouted her lips into a caress, flicking it with her tongue. In one swoop she sucked his cock into her mouth pushing down hard to take it fully into her throat. On the up stroke she was thankful his cock was the usual six inches and not some monster thing that would choke her. 

She had learnt with James to swallow a penis and breathe in a steady rhythm. It was so infuriating that this stranger had the full benefit of her experience. He lay back stretched out letting her get on with the task thoroughly enjoying it. It meant nothing to her. Balancing her forehead on his belly she had its full length buried in her face. 

Supported this way she felt between her legs. She was wetter than she had been all evening. The dreadful truth was she was very near to an orgasm. This causal abuse of her body was turning her on! She had blocked it out but now couldn't deny her own state of excitement. But then, who was abusing her body? He was just lying there. It was she who was using her face to fuck him. 

He came in shuddering gasps racking his legs until they stiffened out straight. For a moment she thought he might be having a heart attack. She lifted the sheet to look up at him from under the tent. After some moments of doubt she watched him open his eyes. 

Eventually he focused on her and smiled. "Wow! Shit! That was really something." 

She opened her mouth as trained by James to show the stranger his sperm. 

He looked at her in surprise. "Go ahead. Swallow it." He said. 

She made a show of gulping it down as though he were the most virile of men and had spurted a bucket full into her mouth. Leaning over his shrunken penis she whimpered knowing it was not her night to cum. So close but so far she felt so frustrated it hurt. 

Misinterpreting her sounds he told her. "Go on, suck on it, and enjoy it. When I wake up I want to see you still there with it in your mouth." He chuckled, satisfied with her work. 

In dismay she settled herself between his legs and sucked his flaccid member into her mouth. Gently she teased its eye with the tip of her tongue but it was no good he began snoring. There would be no satisfaction for her tonight. 'How much more humiliating can it get.' She thought. 

For the rest of the night she would have to suckle his cock like a dummy. It added insult to injury to be told to enjoy it. 'Damn! Why did he have to tell her to enjoy it?' Was this all he thought of her; a cock sucker, a convenient accessory to his cock? 

Perhaps it would be better to resign herself to being a cock slave and avoid the anguish of reason. The hypnotic state she was in meant it might be possible to clear her mind of everything until she thought of nothing but pleasuring a penis. 

Drifting off to sleep her thoughts revolved around the penis in her mouth. It was so enjoyable and relaxing sucking a cock. It was pleasant having no worries or stress with just one thing to do. It was enjoyable. She enjoyed it. She fell asleep with a hand between her legs while gently sucking him. A pleasant smile formed upon her face and she dropped into a deep sleep.  

===

Alice awoke with more than a dirty taste in her mouth. She had a stranger's flaccid cock there and she was sucking on it. Not by choice for she had always been a bit of a quiet prude. Her husband, when he was alive, had given up encouraging her to try something different and even then he hadn't asked for anything too out of the ordinary. 

She laid there hoping George would soon wake and free her of the command to do just as she was doing: suckling his cock like a dummy. Being so heavily hypnotised she would have to do just as he had ordered. He had no idea she was hypnotised. He thought she was just some kinky housewife getting a thrill from being submissive to a man, any man. 

She watched his eyes open heavy with sleep and blood shot from drink. It was not a pretty sight though he fared well being only in his twenties. 

At thirty-four she was an attractive woman. Men liked her large firm breasts and though her legs weren't model long they were shapely enough to look good in stockings. 

That was another thing. She wore such provocative clothing since this sorry situation started it had become just a regular thing to show off her body, even to strangers. It was what those strangers were doing to her that was extraordinary. 

"Good morning! You're enjoying yourself then." He said. 

She wanted to tell him, 'No!' She wanted to spit out his cock in shame. It wasn't his fault. He was merely telling her what to do, what he thought she enjoyed. He probably didn't even remember ordering her to suck it all night. It slipped from her mouth as he made to rise from the bed. 

A pang of anguish took her by surprise. She looked at his penis with longing as though her dummy had been snatched away. She wanted it back where it belonged, between her lips. The rude notion shook her. Vaguely it came back to her that he had told her to enjoy it. 

"There's no time for that. I have work to do. You can clean up the place while I'm gone. You can't wear this dress it's a mess." He said. 

She looked at it awkwardly not knowing what to do. She hadn't brought anything else with her. Inside it was stained with her own juices from his friend's manipulation of her pussy. They had lewdly played with her while playing cards. Passing her from one to the other as though she were a poker chip to be won or lost. She had felt like an object to be used and abused. 

After the game this stranger had taken her in payment for James gambling debts. So was she now just some sex object owned by this man. It was a humiliating thought yet the very degradation of her status was exciting. 

George opened a wardrobe. "In here there might be something to fit. That flighty bitch Jane probably left half her clothes. Here try this for size." He told her. 

Alice didn't need an order to cover herself up. It was a pretty pink dress, something a daughter might wear rather than a mature woman. It said something about his past girlfriend Jane. She held it up to herself looking in the mirror. It would fit, just. 

After a shower she returned to the bedroom to find he had been considerate enough to leave a pair of clean white panties on the bed. Hers were in an even worse state than the dress. It was daunting to think she had been so wet from being played with by strangers. 

"You look nice. It looks different on you than Jane though." George told her. 

The puzzled look on his face revealed he didn't quiet know what was different about it. Alice knew without ever seeing the young woman. The dress was designed for someone shorter and with smaller breasts. On Alice the hem was too short and the cleavage too long. But it was better than wondering around in the nude; it would make escape impossible. 

At least George wasn't chasing after her like James had. James had taken her at every opportunity in ever more unusual ways. Not only had he been using her body as a learning tool he seemed to have something to prove. George however seemed self assured and she was beginning to succumb to the charmer. 

"While I'm out you will tidy up the place. I won't be long. Don't answer the door to strangers will you." He joked. 

Well at least that was something she would gladly obey. Not opening the door to anyone would be just perfect. It occurred to her this remark referred to how she looked in the little feminine dress. It was too young for her and at her age it made her seem rather pathetic. 

*** 

Getting to know her way round his apartment didn't take much time but cleaning the cupboards helped discover where things were kept. She heard the door open only then realising she had been waiting for his return. 

"You've done a good job on this place. It hasn't looked so good since I moved in." He said. He could have added that not one of his girl friends had been into the mundane task of cleaning. 

She removed the apron and asked. "Can I get you something to eat, sir?" 

"I don't think we should spoil all your hard work in the kitchen by cooking. There's a good Italian around the corner. Do you like Italian?" He asked. 

"Yes sir." She answered. The conversation was strange for there had been none of this getting to know one another or consideration from James. He already thought she was weird, what would he think of her stilted conversation. 

He looked her over assessing her but before she found out what he was thinking the door buzzer sounded. "Damn. I don't want visitors now." He looked out of the window into the car park. "Hell! That's Jane's mad wheels. You had better hide in the bedroom. If she sees you there will be a scene." 

"Hi! What a surprise. Have you come to collect the rest of your things?" 

Jane interrupted him. "I've decided to give you another chance. No! Don't say a thing you'll only spoil the moment." She said with a hand raised in his face 

"Don't tell me. Your flat mate couldn't cope with you. She wanted to return to the peace and quiet you can't tolerate." 

"I told you not to spoil it. She turned into such a bore since I left. I couldn't go home to daddy as he has a new woman in the house. So you're my last resort." 

"Nice one. You make me feel so wanted." 

"Alright, I missed you. I especially missed that lovely cock of yours. Your not Mr Perfect but you do turn me on and keep me interested." She laughed. 

"I'm interesting am I? I don't let you get your own way, is that what you mean?" George scolded her. 

"Maybe? You know how to treat a woman and you do know how to have a good time. Your fun to be around, I missed that too." Jane said. She pouted a pair of gorgeous lips expecting him to give in. 

She grabbed his shirt and pulled him toward the bedroom. "It's not a good time. I've just got back from a business deal." He tried to tell her. Quickly looking around he noted with relief there was no sign of Alice. 

*** 

Alice watched them career into the bedroom from the wardrobe. So this was Jane. She was about twenty but looked young, waif like. Alice was immediately jealous. He was big enough to stop the slightly built woman but he had let her reel him in. She pushed him onto the bed to have him where she wanted him; flat on his back with her weight pressing him down. She leaned in and kissed him deeply. 

With her fumbling at his zip he had to help. She ripped his trousers down to his knees. Regaining her position she rubbed her clothed body over his writhing with enthusiasm. She bit his lips and explored his mouth. 

She pushed up to sit over his penis, knees straddling him. With an out rush of breath covering a meaningless sound she had obviously found his penis and had it where she wanted it. 

"Oh, fuck, that's good. I want it all. Drive me Georgie." 

From where Alice was squatting it looked as though Jane was doing the driving. She had never seen such an exuberant display. Although of course she could only compare the performance with her own quiet intensity. 

The woman was riding him hard. Then Jane manoeuvred herself again with her feet stretched each side of his head. Alice knew from James experiments upon her how deep a penetration that particular position allowed. 

She was getting hot from just looking and imagining that cock inside her. She didn't need much imagination for she was on intimate terms with it. She probably knew it better than Jane. 

Alice pulled the crotch of her panties to one side and began to frig her self madly. 

George was heaving Jane's body with his hips propelled by great thrusts from his legs. With each shove she was lifted and exhaled a deep groan on the upward climb. His feet were digging into the bed ruffling the bedding into a lump at the end. Eventually the bedding collapsed in a heap on the floor. 

Alice looked at her wasted effort in making it so neatly. She was surprised at the woman not even bothering to take her clothes off. She had simply hiked up her dress and absorbed his penis into her body. Alice guessed the naughty young thing didn't even wear panties. 

Jane's continuous dialogue and groans abruptly stopped. She pushed her torso down onto George and Alice wondered if that hurt him. Alice gave a gut wrenching groan. There was a moment's silence. 

"Fill me up Georgie.! Fill me with your sperm. Cream my womb." Silent again a moment, then she wailed quietly and slowly sank down onto him like a deflating doll. Her blond hair covered his face where he breathed heavily from the exertion of punching her hips with his. 

Alice had a quiet mild orgasm. It was enough to quell the frustration that had been building since last night's experience. She felt dirty having had sex second hand in a wardrobe. She was dressed as a little girl watching adults have sex from a cupboard. 'Well that was something new.' She thought. 'At least it wasn't painful like one of James' butt plugs up my arse.' With a hand over mouth she suppressed a giggle. 

*** 

Jane straightened up her dress, smoothing it down into place trying to remove the creases. "Wow! Brilliant, lover. I'll go fetch my things. Won't be long." Jane said. She blew him a kiss and hurried out. The front door slammed behind her. 

"Alice!" George shouted. "Oh! You're in there. Look, there's been a change of plan. I guess you've seen the reason. She's moving back in. Sorry. She won't be back soon despite what she says. We'll have something to eat and discuss what to do with you. I have a friend who runs an escort agency. He'll be able to give you what you want. He's used to making women do things. I'll give him a ring. I'll be able to get my money back on you." He laughed. 

"You start the meal while I take a shower. Something quick and easy. Make a couple of sandwiches that's all. Nothing fancy and that's an order." He told her. 

In a state of shock she made for the kitchen. With the fridge door open she stood there staring. 'Oh. No! He's going to sell me on to someone. What did he mean - making women do things.' She shivered in fright. 'It's an escort agency that means I'll be set up with strangers expecting me to entertain them. What the hell will I do? Anything they want by the way things have gone recently.' She reflected. 

Shaking herself she went into action. Cheese was the only item not too out of date. "No bread." She sighed. 

*** 

She stepped out onto the street not recognising at all where she was. It had been dark when she arrived and everything looked so different in daylight. Then it struck her. She was out of the apartment because he had ordered her to make sandwiches and they needed bread. 

There was no feeling of freedom from being outside his apartment. She would have to return with the shopping but at least she had escaped this far. Perhaps next time an order might allow her more flexibility with the chance of escape. 

A block away she found a small store. Trying to delay the inevitable return she looked for something more appetising than cheese. The guy behind the counter had been reading a magazine when she walked in. It slipped from his hands onto the floor on seeing her stretch over a freezer. 

The security mirror didn't give away much detail but he had caught a glimpse of her white panties. 

Alice felt rather than heard someone behind her. 

"Can I help you?" The guy asked. 

"No thank you sir." She said. Alice became self-conscious in the little girly dress. He wasn't looking at it though. It was her cleavage that caught his attention. 

"You must have the frozen French fries, they're on special offer." He told her. 

'Damn!' She thought. 'I never considered this. Well it doesn't matter I'm hardly likely to get into much trouble in a store. I might just have to buy a load of things I don't want. That's hardly much different from the usual shopping trip.' 

Bending over the freezer left her feeling foolish. That was what he was after, a peep at her panties. Well, that was nothing compared to what she had endured recently. The man was in his fifties, and looked untidy enough to be unmarried. What wife would let him out dressed like that? 'Let him have his naughty little thrill.' She thought. If only James had been more specific and ordered her to do as George told her she wouldn't be in this fix. 

"It's a good deal isn't it?" He asked. 

"Yes sir." She answered demurely. She answered automatically as she had been taught by James. It made her feel so immature dressed in the little pink dress having to answer as though everyone was her master. 

Her submissive reaction encouraged him. Not that he needed much having spent the afternoon studying the pictures in top shelf magazines. He couldn't believe his luck. 

This gorgeous woman looked rich and was obviously 'slumming it' in this rough neighbourhood. The dress looked as though it cost a weeks' wage. What she was playing at dressed like a little tart he didn't bother to think about. 

"There are packets of crackers I can let you have at a bargain price. You've just got to have them lady." He told her. 

'Put like that, how could I refuse?' She thought. 

"Thank you, sir." She sighed. 

"Don't move. I'll get a ladder." He scurried back with a step ladder. She watched him set it up and for a moment just stood there. She almost laughed at his eagerness. Was he going to take her round the store selling everything he wanted to get rid of? From being amused she became annoyed on seeing what his game was really about. He wasn't going to climb it, he was expecting her to. 

"You will have to get them while I hold the ladder. I can't climb, I get vertigo." He said lamely. "That's it. Just reach across." He told her. 

It was infuriating to have the stupid man directing her every move. The ladder was purposely to the left of where the packets were sitting. He was telling her to stretch across for them. In pretence of holding the ladder steady he was looking up the short dress. She could almost feel his eyes, out on stalks, poking the crotch of her panties. 

A little naughty thrill was one thing but this was going too far. 

He hesitated not wanting to let go of the ladder but needing to serve a customer. "Stay there. Don't move." He told her. 

With one foot on the ladder and the other on a shelf her legs were splayed for a clear view of her crotch. It was so embarrassing she just hoped no one came near. 

A couple of teenagers sauntered in and down her aisle. They unashamedly looked up her dress. 

"Nice arse girl." The tall one said. 

The short one sneered. "Your panties are wet slut. They're sticking to you pussy. You are one dirty girl." He told her. 

She listened to them walk off toward the counter laughing at her still commenting on her lewdness. 

A customer walked in sidling past not wanting to be seen looking. "You must come down from there it's dangerous. I'll help you down." He told her kindly. 

"Thank you, sir." She answered politely. 

He too looked up the dress only less blatantly. He held onto her as she stepped off the ladder. He was too close for comfort but at least he had got her down from such a precarious position. 

"I should get a reward." He said nervously. 

"Yes sir." She answered. Of all the people she had come into contact with this man was the only one who had helped her out of a difficult situation. He did deserve reward. 

When he moved forward to kiss her lips she opened her mouth. A demure peck on the lips was one thing but to open her mouth to a stranger just wouldn't have happened a few weeks ago. A few weeks ago she wouldn't dare venture into this neighbourhood, especially dressed like this. 

He was surprised to find her lips parted and for a moment his tongue met hers. In surprise he stood back. 

Alice wanted to spit. He was a smoker and the bad taste almost made her retch. At least she was down from that ladder. She picked up the bread, crackers and frozen French fries, holding them in her arms. She made her way to the counter to pay. Alice had great satisfaction on seeing the look of disappointment on the crude mans face behind the counter. She had spoilt his plans by escaping from the ladder. 

He smirked and she wondered why. 

Looking down at the groceries on the counter she caught sight of her nipples. They were cold from the frozen fries and stuck out through the light cotton like bullets. They pointed at him accusingly. 

She meaningfully looked at her blossoming nipples then looked him in the eye and grinned. 'Damn! What have those young men put into my head? I'm behaving like a dirty girl." 

He dropped each item into a bag hardly taking his eyes from her breasts. 

In consternation she realised she didn't have any money with her, not even a purse. Hardly sleeping last night left her exhausted and was affecting her judgement and leaving her even more vulnerable to suggestion. 

"Well you must pay now I've rung them up on the till." He told her. It was of course a lie, they both knew that. She just stood there in a quandary for she needed to take the bread back to the apartment as ordered. 

"You've no cash so you'll have to pay in kind." He told her. 

Cringing with anguish even before the words left her lips she silently cursed him and James. "Yes sir." She answered, her voice quavering. 

So what was he going to do to her here in the store? Put her on special offer. Get her to flash him and customers who came in? In resignation she told herself to just get on with it and back to the relative safety of George's apartment. 

It occurred to her this might be a way out. If he ordered her away after having his fun it might be interpreted to her advantage. He might even send her home. She gritted her teeth and told herself to just do as he told her. After all what could happen in the store where a customer might come in at any minute. 

"Follow me." He told her. 

*** 

Alice hadn't guessed there was a store room. Standing there before him she refused to think of what dreadful things he could do to her here in this grubby hole. 

"You can start with a lap dance. Slowly off with the dress then the rest. Gyrate those hips girl." He told her. 

He hardly needed to direct her. In that place she felt like a dirty girl and began to behave like one. It occurred to her this was a step up from what she had been doing last night. She had behaved like an unpaid whore with George and his friends. 

She was dressed like one, had been told she was a dirty girl by those young men, and now she felt like one. She danced without music like a dirty little bitch on heat. Gyrating her hips, full of sexual suggestion, she let herself go. 

With fingers tucked into the sides of her panties she slowly peeled them down her legs. She bent forward with her arse in his face displaying a pair of wet lips. She wished he would reach out and touch her body to complete the agony. 

The door opened on the sordid scene. "What the hell! Get the fuck out there the customers are stealing the merchandise." The owner shouted at the dirty old man.  

===

The man skirted round his boss who stood there huffing and puffing in anger. His red face gave him the appearance of a boiler about to explode. His hands clenched and unclenched. "What the hell do you think your doing?" He shouted at her. 

"I'm paying for the groceries." She replied. The answer shook her. She was stripping for food. How low could she get. The awareness of how degraded her morals were shattered her self-worth. 

"You're a dirty whore. I don't want the likes of you in my store. Get out. Walk the streets where you belong. Look for customers on the street not in my store. Don't come back here or I'll phone the police." He ranted at her. 

Scooping up her clothes she ran out of the store. With them bundled in her arms she shivered in fright. Standing naked on a street corner was a horrifying nightmare come true. "No! No, no, no. This can't be happening." She whispered. 

They were staring at her. As though she might become invisible if she stood still enough she froze. People were giggling and making awful remarks about her nakedness. Before it drove her into madness she pulled on her clothes and headed down the street straightening them as she went. 

A block down from the store she the fast walk turned into a saunter. Her hips began to sway in a steady rhythm. 'At least I'm free of George and being sold to a glorified pimp.' She sighed. 

The wind lifted the hem of the dress flashing her knickers. She was too exhausted to control it she carried on aimlessly walking desperately trying to think what to do next. She wistfully looked at the cars passing wishing she could get a ride home. Perhaps she should try and hitch a ride. 

A young outside her shop stopped sweeping as Alice approached. She looked Alice up and down. "Pull your dress down girl. Don't you know your advertising?" She chuckled then realisation swept her face. She noticed Alice was scanning the passing cars. 

"Your one of those whores. Get out of here. I don't want you cheap whores back here spoiling my trade. Go get your tricks somewhere else. Just walk on up the street where you belong. You cheap whore." The young woman said. 

So that was why she hadn't pulled down her dress. It was a frightening realisation that she was looking to be picked up, not for a ride home, but for business. Twice she had been told she was a whore. She had been blocking out of mind the terrible prospect that she was scanning cars as they passed to turn a trick. 

Alice moved on not knowing where she might end up. 

A car stopped and she leant through the open window. Involuntarily the words left her throat in a husky stage whisper. "Do you want a cheap whore?" She asked. Tears formed in her eyes. She dare not look at the stranger who was about to buy her body. 

She knew only too well he could tell her to do anything he wanted however perverted. Perhaps she would have been better off being sold on to George's contact. At least she would have been looked after, protected from the worst that men could do to her. 

Out here she was alone and could only say 'yes' to whatever they wanted. If she stayed out on the streets long enough there would be no turning back. She had already been in a hypnotic state for over twenty-four hours reinforcing its power over her. At the beginning she might have been able to shake it off but not now. 

"Get in the back and lie down." The man told her forcefully. 

'Shit! What now?' She thought. She feared she was being kidnapped. Hidden from view on the back seat she couldn't see where she was going or who had taken her. 'How does he know I will lie here quietly as he told me?' She pondered. 'Unless he knows I'm hypnotised. 'At least it can't be a kidnapping.' She threw out the thought that it couldn't get any worse for it always did. 

The car pulled up and he leaned over to tell her. "Follow me." With head down she didn't care where she was but what was going to happen to her. Alice was bout to say to her self, at least I'm off the streets, but dare not tempt fate. 

Only half aware of her surroundings she followed him into a rough looking building that had been a warehouse once. "Sit down right there." He ordered her. He didn't tell her he had ordered her. What was going on? 

"Drink this." He said. 

She sipped it as though she had a choice after such a direct order. It was there in his voice, everything a command. With relief she found it was water and gulped greedily at it. 

"You're worn out and dehydrated. You must drink more water, and then you can sleep." Half way through the last glass of water she fell asleep sitting up on the sofa. 

*** 

Waking up she wondered where she was. In a soft comfortable bed, alone, that was where she was. Not remembering how she got there or who with she became frightened. 

In walked a stranger. It came back to her that she had been picked up by a punter, buying her to perform. 

"Drink this." He told her. She remembered the commanding voice. There was no question she had to do as she was told. The fresh orange juice wasn't so much drank as absorbed. 

"Tell me everything that has happened to you since I left you at your house." He commanded forcefully. 

She blinked back tears so that she could look at him. It was Darren! She spent what seemed the most embarrassing two hours telling him everything. Every humiliating detail spilled out of her mouth, as ordered. The feelings, sensations, everything was revealed. She told him every sordid little detail. 

At last she was silent. It was all out and a great relief. 

"I went back to your house to find out why you hadn't called. James was there. He wouldn't let me in so I forced my way in. He wouldn't tell me anything so I forced it out of him. He's not in hospital but only just. I was hanging around Georgies' place wondering what to do. He's not someone to tackle so easily. You'll have to lie low here for awhile." Darren explained. 

"I thought I saw you on the street then lost you. That must have been when you went into the store. Anyway, by the time I drove back round the block there you were. I had to keep you out of sight in case George or one of his friends spotted you. I don't want to get caught up with them." He said. Darren gave her a big smile. 

"You're safe here." He shrugged unsure whether to go on. "When you're ready for it I have the phrase to release you." 

Her eyes opened wide. Was she dreaming or was it really all over. 

"It's not going to be that simple though. You'll need rest and help in overcoming those deep suggestions. I contacted a professional hypnotist and he told me you shouldn't have been left so long under its influence. It must be deep seated now." He said 

As dreadful as she felt his smile comforted her. It shone from his face replacing the deep frown of concern that had been there while she told her sorry tale. She rested her head back on the soft pillow. She really was safe now. She trusted him. There was some doubt though. 

Did she want him to rid her mind of all those things she had learnt? James had used her as an experimental doll but she too had learnt something about the pleasures her body could give and take. It might be nice to use those skills with this gorgeous man. Report_Story
