Chapter 01 

A beauty bound and packaged 

"Oh! oo. Haff erfy o me. lease, oo ore. etty ease." 

Roberta listened for a moment to Melanie begging for mercy through the makeshift gag. Tears rolled down Melanie's cheeks while silent laughter rocked her shoulders. Unmercifully Roberta resumed tickling her flatmate enjoying the squeals and helpless laughter. 

It was a hot Friday afternoon and the two flatmates had stripped down to their underwear. It was hot work packing up in preparation to move into another apartment. An apartment where the air conditioning worked! 

The two women got on well despite being opposites. Melanie was soft and feminine in body and soul whereas Roberta had a hard streak and worked out honing a muscular frame. 

Melanie was a busty blond smart enough, even at twenty-one, to act dumb to get what she wanted. Roberta was twenty-two, a long limbed, raven-haired beauty with flashing eyes and a short temper. 

Roberta was fractious after being ribbed all morning about a naughty weekend away with her boyfriend. She wasn't ashamed of what she had done but it just wasn't something she wanted to share with Melanie at the moment and knew the pest wouldn't let it rest. It was some relief to have stifled the questioning with a gag, if only for a short while. 

Roberta could move fast when she wanted, sometimes quicker than her thoughts, leaving it to later to think things through. While her friend was laughing helplessly on the floor she wound string around both wrists and ankles. Tying her up with the string and tape they used for packing had been just a bit of fun as well as sweet revenge. 

*** 

Roberta looked her in the eye. "I'll let Martin tell you all about it, I'm sure you'll enjoy the gossip. He can have you for his plaything until you learn not to ask so many questions." Roberta fastened her into a hog tie, with ankles attached to wrists, leaving her on her tummy in the lounge. 

Trussed like a chicken she had no choice but wait on Roberta's decision of what to do next. She tried to say enough was enough but Roberta wasn't listening even if she could understand the mangled clipped words dripping from the gag. Not believing Roberta would let the boyfriend see her in underwear, she thought herself safe. She didn't believe they would include her in their naughty games either. 

She was still curious as to what they had been up to and lay there wondering what it was like to play lewd games for a whole weekend in a sex club. The more she heard from Roberta the more she had wanted to know and had become excited at the idea of playing naughty sexy games. Melanie had heard of such games but up until then hadn't thought it would excite her. 

Listening to the phone conversation she began to wonder how much trouble she was in, but then realised her friend must have omitted a digit when she dialled. Her friend was playing a game pretending to talk to the boyfriend, Martin. 

Enjoying the efforts her friend was going through distracted her from realising how much she enjoyed being confined. Powerless to move she lay on the carpet amused at the effort Roberta was taking to frighten her into submission. 

The carpet smelt a little stale and there was plenty of dust under the sofa, apart from that she was pretty relaxed. Determined to remain calm, to avoid cramp and avoid becoming irritable, there was nothing she could do but relax and meditate. 

"OK. You're lucky. He was out." Roberta said. When Melanie chuckled she quickly added. "Perhaps I'll give you to someone else. I'm sure plenty of men would like a helpless naked woman to play with." Roberta pulled the gag away from Melanie's lips to see what she had to say for herself. 

The silliness and illogic of the statement was not lost to Melanie. "I'm not naked and if you give me away, how will you organise the move without me!" She laughed. 

Marching back from the kitchen with a pair of scissors Roberta tried again. Waving the scissors in front of her face Roberta told her. "A trim of those lovely golden tresses will change your mind. A short back and sides?" she asked. 

The sound of the scissors scrapping back and forth worried her for a moment but when no hair fell to the carpet Melanie realised it was the sound of an empty threat. Laughing with relief caused Roberta to growl in frustration. 

The scissors were cutting now but not easily. At first she thought her bonds were being cut but it was the toughness of a bra strap that was so difficult. The straps pinged back with the release of a heavy load. Snips in little bites at her panties soon had them in shreds. 

Roberta pulled the underwear from around the string in pieces pilling them next to her flatmate. "Now you're naked. Are you prepared to submit? Submit to someone who will teach you to do as you're told and not make mischief?" she said with a slight edge to the tone of voice. 

Melanie was outraged. "You'll pay for that underwear first! I won't give in until you get me some new underwear." Defiance and silence was a tactic she knew would work with Roberta, as the young woman would tire of the game long before she did. 

"OK. Have it your own way. I'll have you spanked like the spoilt brat you are then we'll see who gives in first. Anything to say?" Roberta taunted her. 

Melanie wondered what all this talk of being spoilt meant for it was Roberta who was being childish. She shook her head in defiance anyway. She was confident Roberta would give in soon. They could get back to the serious business of packing ready for the delivery men. 

"Yuck!" This was all Melanie could say at the spoon of lemon juice shoved between her lips. Her friend knew she hated anything sour. While she closed her eyes and exclaimed disgust she felt something rudely shoved into her open mouth. 

Deftly tying a ribbon behind her head, to hold the gag in place, Roberta smiled a little victory. "That will give you something to think about. I didn't tell you much about that weekend did I?" She left the statement in the air to thump down hard upon the prisoner. 

Melanie was taken by surprise, shocked even. Trying to speak, to give in, she found her voice effectively muzzled. Nothing reached her own ears but a muffled murmur. Exploring the intrusion she found her mouth was held open by a ball with ribbon through it extending out over both cheeks and tied behind her head. 

It was simple and more effective than the make shift one used before. It was stopping her from saying she was ready to give in. "Damn!" She tried to say but heard only a muffled hum. 

'How the hell did this happen.' Melanie thought. It had only started as the usual friendly banter, now she was bound helpless on the living room floor. She had been helpless with laughter and tears rolling down her cheeks, but not now, this was getting too serious. 

Comfortable despite the situation she tried not to think about it in case she again fell into fits of laughter leading on into hysteria. It was ridiculous. Bound and gagged naked in her apartment. Why it was so funny, she couldn't understand. 

The familiar sound of the doorbell stilled the fidgeting completely, flattening out any comical feelings to a dull dread. The old fashioned bell had always been a joke between them as it represented the boring old couple that owned it before them. Now it represented an outside threat. 

An unknown element had been introduced, be it boyfriend or stranger, or even a mutual friend. This could be very embarrassing. With the door open a breeze from the outside world fell upon her whispering she was vulnerable. The door slammed closed. 

"What was the message you left on the answer phone all about?" The voice of Martin, Roberta's boyfriend echoed through the hall. His nasal ringing tones made goose bumps flesh out on her buttocks sending a little thrill along her spine. The hair on the nape of her neck stood out. He always did that to her. Now more than ever she would find it difficult to talk to him. 

She imagined a young man tanned and muscular with an obvious sex drive that drove her to a state of desperation. One night she had been in heaven when Roberta had shared him with her. He had shagged her brains out all night eventually sating her desire in the early hours of the morning. 

On waking next morning it had been a serious disappointment to be hugging just a pillow, but then again the obvious complications weren't there to face either. 

Obviously Roberta would steer him well clear of the living room. Would Roberta make noisy love to him in the bedroom next door while she had no choice but listen? 

Her lips were twitching at the thought he would find her naked. At his mercy she was bound to let him take whatever he wanted. He could simply use her on this carpet. She imagined the carpet burns with pleasure. It wouldn't matter about stains for they could be left for the next tenants to wonder over. 

No, he would not be allowed to see her naked. 'Pity', she thought. He might compare her favourably with Roberta. Her hair was longer and silkier and men seemed to like the slim waist for it accentuated a pair of firm large breasts. Not fat by any means but not skinny, or lean as Roberta insisted on calling herself. 

"Come on we can't wait all day. If you're ready how come you're in a dressing gown? The guys are here so I hope you and Melanie have packed up ready to be moved." Martin complained. 

"Yes, yes. Just go and make sure they don't back over someone in that truck." 

Roberta ran back into Melanie's narrow vision encompassing not much more than an unusual angle of the floor. After a few seconds of frustrated snipping she threw the scissors across the room then cursed as they disappeared into an open box. They were too blunt to tackle the string. 

"I can't get the bloody string undone!" Roberta exclaimed. 

In desperation she dragged an empty case over beside Melanie and rolled her friend into it. With a levered heft the box was upright with Melanie looking up at her, eyes wide in bewilderment. 

"Sorry Melanie! I can't get you free and the men are on their way up. I'll tell them to leave this box here and I'll release you when they've gone," she explained. 

Tipping a bag of white plastic snow into the box soon buried the accusing stare. As she snapped the last clips into place Martin and the removal guys walked in. 

"Don't say a thing! I'll be ready in a moment." Roberta said through gritted teeth stomping out to the bedroom. Pulling on the last set of unpacked clothes she wondered what she would do about Melanie. 

Her friend would be furious at being delivered to their new flat in a packing case. What could she have done? Leaving her friend for the delivery men to untie would be interesting but unreasonable. Roberta laughed out loud. Melanie wouldn't have thanked her for that humiliation! 

"We've got to pick up the keys and be at the apartment before these removal guys arrive. So come on shift yourself. Move!" Martin told her while making waving motions with his hands as though shooing pigeons from a park bench. 

Roberta's plan crumbled on realising she wouldn't be able to get back to the apartment soon enough to release her friend. Melanie would just have to be delivered to the new apartment by these guys. The men looked strong enough to carry her out to the van without dropping her and what else could she do but let things take their course. 

With Martin backing out of the drive Roberta watched the packing case being man handled onto the back of the truck. She should have put a handle with care sticker on it! She closed her eyes trying not to think about what Melanie was going to say about this indignity when unpacked. 

"I didn't know Melanie had an aunt. I thought she was an only child, well an only family member with her parents gone." Martin said, trying to break into her thoughts. 

"She doesn't. Oh! Yea! The friend of the family, she just calls her an aunt." Roberta recovered her thoughts remembering explaining Melanie's absence with a fabricated story. 

"The aunt must have been very ill to leave you to do all the packing. I'm sorry I shouted at you," he apologised, just in case it was that making her so withdrawn. It was unlike Roberta to be quiet and thoughtful and he didn't want her to remain so distant for he was hoping for a good first night in the new apartment. 

*** 

Melanie was furious. Why hadn't Roberta stalled them long enough to get her undone and dressed? "You stupid bitch!" She shouted around the gag. Taking a deep breath, trying for calm, she told herself it wouldn't be for long. Once they were out of the way her friend would release her. Then Roberta would be for it! 

Yet another deep breath and she was beginning to reach a peaceful Yoga meditation state. The small world inside the box began to recede until her mind expanded far greater than the small black packing case. 

A pleasant dream began involving Martin and a can of spray cream. 

*** 

Bob and Tommy lifted the lid on the packing case wondering if in this one there might be something of value. "What the?" At first Bob thought it was a dead body but the muted complaints and rustling movement of hundreds of plastic packing flakes left no doubt. Someone very much alive was in there. 

He picked himself up off the floor wondering if this was a set-up. 

With less imagination than his partner in crime, Tommy peered in, gawping, with a silly grin on his face. 

Bob looked again into the box where Tommy was smoothing away the loose packing, to reveal a naked body. The squirming had stopped, perhaps because Tommy's hands kept brushing against her breasts and thighs. The older man watched his partner's hands becoming bolder, caressing and pressing between the legs. 

When he started to rub hard the body began squirming once more but there was no escape tied up like that. This was no police set-up, unless there was a police fetish department. A department he hadn't been arrested by, yet. "Stop that. I've got to think. What are we going to do now? With this, I mean, with her. No not that! Leave her alone." 

She was lying on her back with arms and feet tied. Her head, breasts and knees were poking up out of the packing where Tommy had cleared it away. The loose piles had settled back between her legs. 

The problem was she had seen them. Her eyes were closed and there was a dreamy look on her face but they couldn't take the chance. Otherwise they could have dumped the packing case somewhere leaving the problem to someone else. She must have been kidnapped and now they were in the frame for it. They didn't have enough money to go on the run so what could they do? 

"Stop that." Bob told his partner. "Put the lid back on. Hang on." He said. Grabbing a bottle of water he dribbled water around the gag. He didn't want her to die on him. It took awhile but that didn't matter for he had thought of something. With the lid finally back on they loaded the packing case back onto the truck. 

*** 

"The phones just ringing, there's no answer. I guess they don't have anyone in the office on a Saturday, just the two guys moving furniture and stuff. Hey, don't worry, they just got delayed in traffic or had a flat. Besides, all the stuff is insured." 

Roberta growled again. They had been waiting over an hour for the truck and Martin had been reciting useless platitudes for forty-five of those long minutes. Should she tell him, or rather, when should she tell him her friend was in a packing case in that truck? 

"I'm going to the police." Roberta sputtered angrily at him. Her nerves couldn't take much more of this waiting. 

*** 

Melanie was in a cocoon of packaging and lost deeper still in her own thoughts. Dehydrating in the hot box her mind was wavering in the heat. When a hand gently stroked her body it merged with dreams of Martin finding her naked so she struggled to give him what she wanted him to take. 

Her own delirious fantasies had brought her to a state of heightened expectation until the fingers found her sex. She thrust up at them wanting more. She was ready for anything, only the sensations abruptly stopped leaving her unsure if it had happened at all. A moan of frustration went unheard. 

*** 

Back in the apartment it was plain nothing had been delivered. Roberta looked around at the bare walls, picture hook holes neatly filled in, and carpets smelling of cleaning fluid. Taking a deep breath she shot a stern look at Martin daring him to comfort her with more trying banality. 

"The police said to keep in touch meaning they don't intend to do anything about it. I didn't even have the truck number or much of a description of it or them. The removal outfit phone just rings. They said it might be a scam to pick up valuables and just to wait and see. They weren't interested! They just told me to claim on the insurance." 

Martin had learnt not to open his mouth and just shrugged. 

Worrying about Melanie she wondered if her friend were stuck in some lock up garage needing to pee. 'The first bloody sensible thing he's done all day.' She thought, as he put his arms around her for a gently cuddle. 'And, there's more!' She thought, on hearing bubbling sounds and the tangy smell of ground coffee brewing. 

So he wasn't completely useless. He had gone out to buy a coffee machine while she wasted time at the cop shop. Sinking onto the carpet she waited for the desperately needed caffeine. She just hoped Melanie had been discovered and this was all a ploy to upset her. It didn't matter so long as she was safe! She would give her a hearty hug just so long as the damn woman turned up safe. 

"Don't worry. Melanie will be OK. When she gets back from her aunt we might have recovered some of the stuff. They won't want photos and the personal junk that you treasure. We can get some furniture and have the place looking good before she get back. Come on, cheer up, its only stuff!" 

She hit him hard enough to wind him wanting to hurt but feeling already too guilty to harm another of her friends. What was she to do but bother the police and wait it out? 

*** 

"So it's you two lousy thieves. What ever it is I don't want it. In fact get it out of here before someone sees you." The large man barked at them. 

Bob smiled what might have been a winsome look if he had been a puppy, only his old craggy face split into a leer. "You will be surprised. Pleasantly, honest, Eddy." 

The two ruffians carried on into the back office ignoring the barrage of protests. 

"It's a woman." Bob whispered conspiratorially. 

This stopped Edward's protests long enough for them to place the packing case down in the middle of the office and for Tommy to unfasten the lid. 

Wondering what scam they were up to this time he peered in. Tommy pushed aside the packaging revealing areas of smooth skin. He pinched a nipple and both breasts rose up seeking a hand. Moving between the legs the hips thrust up obviously seeking more. 

"She's a fuck machine Eddy. We had to tie her down or she would've raped us. She needs it all the time. Just the kind of girl you need here." Bob began, wondering now if this was the right place to dispose of their awkward cargo. Would he buy it? 

"Bloody hell! You two into kidnapping now? That's a bit out of your league isn't it boys." 

Looking at the two of them and the girl he wondered what they were up to. He knew them long enough to play a game of patience, knowing they would break sooner than later. If he hadn't been intrigued they would have been kicked out by now. He just couldn't see what the scam was. 

Eventually Bob broke and explained what had happened, how a simple theft had gone wrong. For the past month they had put in low quotes to move furniture and riffled the belongings for anything valuable then dumped what they didn't want. 

"You stupid buggers! She isn't a part of your scam then. So you thought you would dump her with me. Nice one Bob. Bloody typical of you to share your troubles." Edward stroked her thigh watching the reaction. She had a nice face, lovely clear skin, and stunning figure. She was in a different league to the girls working for him.  

===

"Leave her with me," Ed said, opening the door. 

"What about money?" Bob started to say. 

"I won't hear of it. What are friends for but to help in a moment of need? I'll dispose of your problem. Now you just forget all about it. Enough said, just forget all about it." Edward told them while steering them by an elbow, in each large fist, down the corridor. 

In the main entrance hall Bob nodded toward the lounge where a couple of ladies were preparing themselves for a busy evening. "What about something on the house?" 

"Don't even think about it sunshine. If I were you I would make yourselves scarce. Dump the junk and the truck and visit distant aged relatives. Another country would be better." Edward stated casually knowing his reputation would carry the weight of argument better than blatant threats. 

He turned back to the office more curious than ever. He couldn't use her here in the brothel but he did know someone. If that didn't work he could use her for the more discerning clientele at the private house. 

*** 

After some persuasion Martin drove Roberta aimlessly around the neighbourhood just looking. It was a long shot but she just couldn't sit around waiting. 

*** 

Edward fed his pet in a box some warm water, enough to keep her from dehydrating dangerously. She seemed to be in a world of her own, perhaps as a way of coping with the situation. He didn't know how long she had been in there or who had incarcerated her in the first place but she seemed to be coping in some way. 

His finger trickled over her lips and yet again the hips rose up seeking solace. She was certainly game for it. 

Edward thought again about keeping her for himself but the reverie was broken by a knock on the office door. He twisted the catches on the packing case back in place. 

"What!" Edward shouted. The doorman told him someone wanted to see him. "OK! You can help carry this out. Load it carefully. It's fragile, so, do NOT drop it." 

The client had been trusting of his assessment of the goods and quickly agreed to the price. It was Saturday night. In only four hours he had disposed of the woman for a very juicy sum. He should have changed the packaging from the original but there hadn't been time. 

*** 

Sunday morning Martin made it clear he thought it a pointless exercise. Driving around the lonely industrial parks and deserted office blocks was depressing. 

She kept meaning to tell him it was Melanie they were looking for but was too afraid. Roberta kept telling herself she was bound to turn up eventually. "OK! Let's go home. I give up." Roberta sighed.

Chapter 02 

The beautiful mystery woman is drugged 

A short flight on a private jet brought the packing case to a large mansion house overlooking the sea. A short middle aged man eagerly undid the clasps and pushed aside the smelly packaging to find a pair of dainty feet. The other end of the box revealed a beautiful face at rest, in sleep. 

Bernard stepped back wiping his hands on expensive suit trousers then thought better of it. The urine would stain so he held his hands out away from him not wanting to be contaminated with the noxious substance. 

He nodded to one of the women standing at attention and she bent to the head, the only part of the body exposed apart from the feet. On pressing a vial of fluid to the lips the eyes opened. There was no sight in them just the look of surprise and confusion. 

Melanie accepted the water and though it tasted bitter greedily sucked it into her mouth taking a deep draught of it. Her lips were parched from dehydration and reached the point of hallucinating, unaware of where she was. 

Before she had a chance to come round properly her eyes began to flutter. A sign they waited for as the drug took hold numbing her thoughts. The box was gently leaned until she slid out onto a rug. Once more she studied a floor close up. It was a very expensive antique Persian rug although she saw it as slightly faded but very clean carpet. 

The string used to secure her body was cut away. It seemed such a long time ago that this strange journey started yet it was less than twenty-four hours. Sunday morning and she was lying naked in a huge room many miles from home. 

Even if she could have mustered the will to move, her limbs were too stiff to even flex. At a wave from the man's hand the two women helped straighten her limbs. 

"Beautiful. Very feminine, very shapely, she will do nicely." Bernard said. 

The man spoke gently with a refined voice leaving the impression a Boston banker had been appraising her assets. She was stretched out flat on her back facing him with legs spread wide while he examined his purchase. Still groggy and stiff she could do nothing to ward off those heavy serious eyes. 

"Take her." He said with an imperious gesture to the women. 

They were floating in her peripheral vision like fairies dressed in gossamer. In a daze she was taken away, supported by the two women, to be bathed. Her lower body was sticky with urine and other bodily fluids. 

"Where am I?" she croaked with a weak voice. They both raised a finger to their lips, and Melanie caught their meaning though she was too fragile to manage more so had to remain silent. Guided into a large bath she was pampered with lather and silky ointments. Once patted dry with fluffy bath towels she was led back along the same long corridors. 

Her eyes concentrated upon an oil painting for a moment as she passed the image carried with her for a few paces until another replaced it. It was all a dream with a string of disconnected images passing through her mind. 

The interior of the grand house was furnished simply and elegantly expensive. Led by the elbows she entered a book-lined study furnished with heavy masculine furniture. The master of the house was a slightly built man engulfed among documents strewn about the large leather-padded desk. 

She felt small and insignificant standing silently before him bringing back feelings of being an errant schoolgirl before the headmaster. It was difficult to concentrate and her eyes wandered around the room aimlessly. Her legs trembled beneath her and thankfully she was guided onto the floor to sit before she fell. 

The strange quiet women stretched her out on the floor and all she wanted was too sleep. 

The man gestured at the prone figure lying naked on the study floor. 

One of the women reached forward and stroked an inner thigh while the other ran open palms over both nipples. When Melanie lifted her hips both hands cupped her crotch engulfing her bottom and pussy. 

It was a surprise that her body responded to their touch so crudely. It seemed a part of her mind was still locked away concentrating on being taken by Martin. The hands pumped her breasts while fingers firmly worked upon a more intimate exploration of her vagina. 

An inner self agreed with the persuasive touches hoping this was the moment craved for; she was surely going to orgasm this time. 

Able to move her eyes Melanie looked up at the gentleman directing the two pairs of hands and assessed his suit as being the most expensive she had ever seen. Sensibly and coolly she waited for that other-self to reach its ambitious orgasm. 

The sensible self wanted to scream as she was spread-eagled before a stranger who was directing two women to expertly work her naked body into a state of ecstasy. This was some weird dream she thought. 

The other-self reached its climax, so long craved for, with an expected dramatic conclusion drawn out over many minutes, seeming to take forever. A small conscious mind felt the embarrassment wandering on and on as the stranger smiled at her in satisfaction. 

*** 

As soon as her head touched the pillow she was again dreaming, this time of floating with fairies being delightfully molested by them. 

It was early morning when the two women woke and dressed her. Although muscles were still stiff she could stand and the string marks were beginning to fade. Her mind seemed to be on the mend to. They gave her a drink which she greedily supped hoping the fuzziness in her mind would clear. 

They were both dressed in a transparent silk shift, slung low off the shoulder and well above the knee. Glancing in a mirror she saw she was too. Was this a continuation of that dream? 

Led to a kitchen she sat at a table while they prepared breakfast and the smell of food brought about a ravenous hunger. How long ago was it she ate? How long had she been in that damn box? 

Melanie wanted to ask questions but it seemed so difficult to focus, to form the words. They led her along a familiar corridor into the study. 

He took no notice of the indecent way she was dressed treating it as normal attire, which it seemed to be in this place. He looked at her and she couldn't help but look down, which was a mistake, for she became embarrassed at the sight of her nipples visibly pushing at the thin silk. 

Her nerves were already as thinly stretched as the material covering her body and now she wilted under his gaze. There was a sense of power in those eyes. He was middle aged, assured, used to order in his life and ordering those around him. 

"There is only one rule in this house. Obey. Do as you're told and you will be treated well." The man left the 'or else' as a silent threat. "I purchased you through an intermediary so I don't know your history. I am informed you are untrained but no leeway will be granted while you become used to this household and its ways." 

Melanie listened carefully like a student wishing to impress yet the words didn't seem to make sense. "Yes, Sir." She stammered. It was difficult to make sense of what all this meant. 

"Sophia and Sapphire will take care of you. I shall call you Ruby, yes that will be your name while here. Go now and learn your duties and be ready for my call," he told her. With a nod to Sophia the woman led her away before she had a chance to ask questions. 

'What kind of game were they playing here?' she wondered. As though walking into a door she stopped, skidding slightly on the smooth marble floor on bare feet. This must be the game Roberta had been playing that weekend! 

The whole scene was so overpowering and masculine like a Roman film set. Was all this set-up for her? It couldn't be. Had she really been teased into an orgasm yesterday or had that been in her imagination? 

Her name was Ruby 'while here', so it wasn't a permanent situation. Until she found out how long the stay was - a weekend or maybe a whole week - and more particularly what the punishments were, she would have to obey the rules of the house. 

A little thrill ran up her thighs like the tickle of fingers earlier. Had Roberta arranged all this as a treat for her? Looking around it seemed rather an expensive place to hold naughty games. But then it depended on who else was involved and what was expected in way of game play. Perhaps she would be paying for this by playing to someone else's fantasy too. 

A tingle of fear of the unknown brought a shiver to her spine yet the goose bumps down her thighs revealed a quit different set of feelings. She was excited with the idea of playing at being purchased, of being owned by the master of the house, a trained slave in his household. 

She would see how it turned out, torrid or sad, but in the meantime she couldn't resist taking up the challenge. As usual she would work hard putting all her efforts into making this a special treat, something to remember. 

*** 

Bernard watched Ruby leave with a frown on his face. It was risky not knowing her background though William was a trustworthy finder and knew his job. If she didn't settle in she was still a sound investment if sold on. 

He called William, a member of their private circle. "Good to speak to you. Thank you for giving me first refusal. Yes. I think she will fit in well here. Are you sure you couldn't trace her origins. It's a pity. 

She will need training of course. Yes I agree he's very good. At the moment she seems to be accepting things for some reason, probably still in shock. Make an appointment with the trainer, the sooner the better. Thank you and you too." He hung up pondering how to treat this latest and unexpected acquisition. 

*** 

The two idiots had run out of money so decided to set up the scam again to get enough funds to leave town. On the phone Bob arranged a visit to estimate a price. He didn't recognise Roberta's voice as Melanie had made the arrangements last time. 

Roberta was growing tired of the removal men visiting uselessly. They were polite enough arriving but damn rude when she told them it had been a mistake. They scanned the empty apartment and hurriedly left. 

This time she recognised the truck and the two men approaching. She stood back inviting them in and was relieved they didn't recognise her. They looked around then turned to her with puzzled looks on their faces. That soon changed to fear. 

Roberta held a starting pistol close to her body pointing it at them, pleased with the effect. "Where is she?" 

Bob spluttered an incoherent reply. With awe in his voice Tommy said, "Are you the kidnapper?" 

Roberta creased her brow in confusion quickly changing it to anger. "Where is she?" Levelling the harmless gun at Tommy she repeated with a flat level voice the same question. They looked intimidated but needed an added incentive. Looking over their shoulders to the bedroom door she nodded. 

When they naturally went to turn around she barked at them. "Turn around and I'll fire. You don't need to see him." There was no one there but it had the desired effect. "Where is she?" 

Tommy looked petulant. Bob began to speak with half formed words. He licked his lips and tried again. "We don't have her. We took her somewhere I'm sure she's OK. No. I can't tell you where." 

She levelled the weapon at Tommy, making an exaggeration of squeezing the trigger. He realised it was pointing between his legs and burst out with the one name repeated a coupe of times as though it should be recognised. "Eddy! Eddy's got her." 

"Shit Tommy, you'll get us in trouble you stupid bugger," Bob cursed at his friend. 

"He didn't pay us did he?" Tommy complained. 

"Where is this Eddy?" Roberta asked. 

"She won't be there. He would have sent her somewhere. He has contacts." Under the stare Bob began to tell what little he knew from drinking with one of the heavies at the brothel. 

The two misfits walked quickly down the stairs then broke into a run for the truck. It wouldn't start then burst into life; as though already in gear it lurch down the street and away. Before it ran out of gas they would siphon someone's tank and keep going putting as many miles as possible between them and fear. 

Roberta got out of the taxi a block away from the address they gave hoping she hadn't been spun a yarn. It was a nice respectable street with large houses protected from prying eyes by high walls and hedges. 

The one she wanted was no exception. Buzzing an intercom she talked her way in. Talking her way further into trouble gave her a stammer and nervous gait. Her legs felt as if they would give way. 

At last sitting in a very male office, un-littered with paperwork she noticed, a large man walked in. She stood up nervously with an apologetic smile. She had seen what the place was on the way to his office. It was a brothel. 

"Sorry to bother you, sir," she said. 

"I only have a few minutes so best state your business quickly," he told her. The smile was designed to put her at ease but held little warmth. 

"I need money. A lot of money. In a bit of trouble too." Roberta stammered. He asked as expected and she mentioned names as references. The promise not to mention the bastard's names was broken but that was of no consequence. She had been accepted as having the right background. 

"I don't know anyone else to ask. I was thrown out of my apartment and owe money. My boyfriend is out soon and I don't want to be around when he hits town. Bob told me some time ago you might help," she said. The words plummeted from her mouth leaving her deflated in the chair. 

The little pathetic voice fitted the pathetic story and he was buying it. 

"I could make a phone call now. You could be far away from here living in a rich mans house. Once free of his service you would have a tidy sum to start over," he said. 

"Oh! Thank you, sir," she looked up to offer a little pleasant smile. He was looking at her slim body that wasn't hidden much by the cheap light summer dress she wore. She felt disgusted by that look but hid her face in the long black hair hanging over her face. 

"Stand up. Let me get a good look at you. You will be serving in a rich mans home so I need to be carful before recommending you. Take the dress off," he said. 

"But sir," she protested lamely. 

"It's alright I'll stay this side of the desk, I'm not interested in you like that. You need to learn to obey orders girl," he said. 

Knowing the put-down was a part of his assessment didn't help for she felt embarrassed anyway. "Yes sir. I'm sorry sir." Roberta meekly said, trying hard to turn the red faced anger into the appearance of the humiliation he expected. 

She stood with shoulders bent forward and with hands knotted in front of her trying to hide her body. 

"Stand up straight, shoulders back, hands at your side," he barked, as though she were on parade. 

Flinching at every command she meekly obeyed. She tried a weak smile as though trying to win his approval. It worked. 

"You'll do!" he told her. "Wait outside," he said with a dismissive tone. "Take that dress with you," he added. 

Roberta felt so clever at purposely moving toward the door without the dress she didn't care about bending over in front of him in the thong. She was on the track of her friend and could feel the guilt melting away. 

Perhaps she would have a peaceful sleep tonight at last.

Chapter 03 

The sex party 

Working hard all day had the advantage of distracting Melanie from what might happen to her this evening. With the two silent women, Sophia and Sapphire, a banquet was being prepared which meant visitors to the mansion were expected. 

Who they were and what was expected of her was still a mystery for they were forbidden to talk and so was she. They both wore just a short see-through shift and she had become used to wearing the same, but to be on display to complete strangers was more than a little daunting. 

Being drugged continued the confusion so she continued to believe Roberta had sent her there to play out a fantasy game. Melanie was determined to see it through. All she had been told was to obey and that she did easily as all they were doing was preparing diner for visitors. Was that when she would be expected to play some naughty game to earn her place here? It frightened her, yet excited too. 

At last the buffet was set with an ornate display, enough to feed an army. A lobster with an array of seafood was laid out under magnificent candelabra as the centrepiece. 

Exotic fruit carved into animal shapes, sliced meats, everything was there in plenty. The guests arrived without the expected change of clothing so she stood quietly trying to be unobtrusive, ready to serve from the buffet. The two women led men into the room, each one of them dressed in a Roman toga. 

Melanie found the men's companions fascinating. The women were dressed in risqué Roman fantasy costumes. That wasn't all. They either stood beside their seated gentlemen or kneeled at their feet. A young woman on hands and knees seemed to be fitted with a tray on her back, for her to be a piece of furniture. 

This was crazy, fascinating and exciting. This was one place a naked woman could avoid attention. Anyone could see her body clearly through the costume and so she had to remember not to get carried away in this intense atmosphere for they would be able to tell at a glance she was excited. 

Melanie felt as though she were being ignored yet despite earlier misgivings wanted to be a part of this bizarre gathering. They must be regulars she thought, though they didn't look like husbands and wives or even regular couples. 

"Let me show you off, Ruby," Bernard said, taking hold of her arm. With little choice she was marched across the room to a large rotund man hiding a chair under a fulsome toga. "This is my latest acquisition, he boasted. I've named her Ruby. She isn't trained, as you can see but has potential, I think." 

"Very nice, I'm sure. You should teach her how to greet her betters at least." The fat man sneered. "You could give her to me for the evening, I'll teach her for you." 

Bernard frowned and cut him short with a wave of his hand. Embarrassed at the way she had stared at the man, he led her out the room where he found Sophia. "Teach her to greet the guests properly then bring her back. She can join in the entertainment. Be quick." 

Sophia didn't say a word. She stood with head bowed until Melanie took the hint. With a foot she separated Melanie's feet splaying them outward. Could she stand displaying herself like that in a room full of strangers? The room wasn't dimly lit; everything would be clearly on display through the filmy material. 

Led back into the room she stood slightly behind Bernard head bowed, as he toured the room conversing with guests. When introduced she would open her legs and clumsily curtsy. This wasn't exciting at all, it was embarrassing and demeaning. 

She felt like a little devil being naughty among her elders, showing off for attention. These strangers were examining her body comparing her breasts with those of a companion. The shape and colour of her shaved vagina was even commented upon, as though she were a mere possession, a mare purchased for breeding stock. 

As much as the humiliation hurt there didn't seem a way out of this sordid game. She didn't know where she was and had no clothes or money to find a way home. 'If Roberta had been able to stand it then so can I,' she told herself. 

As the evening wore on she calmed down enough to find it disturbingly attractive. At least no one had touched her although there had been someone she wouldn't have made a complaint against if he had. 

What a strange way to meet someone. He was strong and handsome, a man with arms she could sink into and feel protected and loved. As though she were dressed in a ball gown or her little black dress sipping cocktails, she imagined them chatting together, getting to know each other. 

Instead she was almost naked acting as his servant, helping him with a plate of food. Dutifully following him back to his seat, he indicated casually where she should place the dish. 

She laid it carefully on the tray set into the outfit of a woman beside him, still patiently waiting on hands and knees. Forgetting herself she stood and stared in curiosity at this human piece of furniture. 

"You will be in trouble Ruby if your master catches you. The big man is taking an interest in you and that means trouble. Sit down here by me until he finds something else to complain about. You don't want to be given to him for the night do you?" He chided her. 

Melanie blushed that he had remembered her given name: no one here used a real name. It felt humiliating to be asked if she wanted to be given to some stranger. Eager to lose the fat man's attention she did as he told her. 

Squatting before him she almost rested her chin on his knee. It seemed so easy to become close here, to become carried away with the sexual charge atmosphere. So much sexual tension was in the air, it crackled, standing the fine hairs of her arms on end. 

She squatted at his feet gazing up at him, content to listen to his deep strong voice while he exchanged gossip with others. Inside she seemed to be reduced to a lovesick puppy wanting him to protect her. If he took a fancy to her could she complete her fantasy weekend with him? Her nipples were standing out proud and she dare not think about what was happening between her legs. 

A man marched into the large ballroom wearing a full Roman centurion's uniform and the room took notice, it fell silent with expectation. 

Twisting round to view the entertainment she leant against his knee. The six- foot tall athletic man made some announcement about returning from war with Caesar against the Gaul's; capturing slaves. 

As he toured the banqueting hall recounting vulgar adventures with foreign slave women he elicited cheers and laughter. She watched the conquering hero lift his tunic to reveal a huge erect penis, which bobbed as he walked, accompanied by appreciative course comments and applause. 

Closing in on the circle of chairs he stopped at each of the women offering his penis. 'He must be a porn star hired for the night's entertainment.' She thought. With everyone encouraging him with ribald remarks the male guests had little choice but order their women to pay homage. 

Melanie watched mesmerised as each in turn kissed the tip of the glistening member. One poor woman, obviously enjoying the evening too much, sucked at it. Accompanied by raucous laughter the master pulled her away by the hair. 

As the Centurion approached Melanie turned away wanting no part of this sordid game. She looked up at the man she was falling for knowing it was an infatuation, or a concentration of lust yet unable to prevent it. 

Her senses had been assaulted by so much sexual play and powerful fantasy she was ready to fall for anyone. At that moment she needed someone to protect her. If she had to pay a price for this lavish game she would be pleased if this handsome man collected it. 

The Centurion was close for she heard his sandals creaking. In the midst of rising off the floor she felt his large hands grasp her hips. As though once more gripped in bondage she was immobile bent forward. A sense of humiliation washed over on hearing the disgusting ribald remarks leaving her swooning. 

She knew what was happening but time stood still freezing her reactions. The horrid shouts receded into the distance as though nothing existed except the lips of her pussy when she felt its touch. 

"No!" She wanted to shout but the shock had constricted and silenced her throat. That monster cock was too big it belonged in a porn film not inside her. "Not here, not now, never!" She needed to shout but couldn't. 

She felt it large and powerful as it pressed at her lips and with that same forward movement pierced her without a regard for what she wanted. There had been no resistance. In one thrust it buried itself deep filling her up, demanding room, reaching further than anything before it. Pushing at the entrance to her womb it seemed to be demanding everything she had. With an extra thrust it stretched her limits further, forcing her legs outward to make room for the monster. 

Stretching her neck up gulping air she caught sight of the handsome stranger watching her. Her hands were on his knees with her open gasping mouth inches from his penis. For a moment a cloud of shame racked her mind. 

She had wanted this man to take an interest in her. She had wanted to get to know him, perhaps even play a game with him. He was watching her having her brains fucked out by an uninvited stranger. The humiliation and all thought was as suddenly swept away by an orgasm. 

He watched that too. As she came round the applause had died down and looking to her right she watched women, one after the other, cleaning the Centurions dripping cock with their tongues. How could she even look at her handsome stranger after this? 

Walking away was no easy task with her weak legs splayed out; she would have to lean on him to straighten up. Somehow it didn't matter about the others in the banqueting hall; just this one man had made personal contact with her. She couldn't just shrug off the squalid act as though she had deserted her wonderful stranger on a dance floor, returning with some excuse about it being a cousin she had danced with. 

Unable to stand she crawled round the edge of the room and out. In a rest room she washed and tended the slight make up she wore. It was too soon for tears but she was sure they would flood later. 

Before everyone in that room she had an orgasm. A short desultory one, but deeply humiliating nevertheless. She had been carelessly used and abandoned. Returning to the banqueting hall she found no one seemed to stare or point at the wanton hussy she now felt like. Melanie made a point of avoiding the handsome young man as much as the odious fat man. 

*** 

Next morning, after breakfast and the party had been cleared away, she once again stood before the master of the house. Even more than the previous day she felt guilty; the errant schoolgirl awaiting a headmaster's punishment. This time the guilt was well founded on what had happened last night and he didn't look amused. He looked at her sternly seeming to measure her up for a punishment. 

"I'm not pleased, Ruby. Some of what happened was my fault. I should have spent more time training you, how to behave and what I expect of you. It seems it wasn't enough for you to pick up good habits from Sophia and Sapphire. I have decided to send you for training. There is nothing to pack so you can leave immediately. Good luck and bon voyage." He told her. 

With his head once more buried in paperwork it seemed she had been dismissed. Had she broken the rules or was all this a part of the game? Perhaps she was being sent back home with the two days now over. It hadn't been what she had expected; not romantic at all. The feelings of excitement had been replaced with shame and humiliation. 

At the study door the ever-silent Sapphire walked her to the kitchen, out a back door and opened the door to a limo, all without speaking or revealing the slightest emotion. 

Melanie slid into the leather upholstery feeling her bare bottom on the seat, only then wondering how she was expected to get home dressed like this. It would be nice if the driver dropped her off at the end of the street, nice for the local men that is. After all that had happened recently it wouldn't matter if he did for she had sunk to her lowest ebb. 

In a secluded part of a local airfield she was quickly transferred from limo to private jet. Not seeing anyone during the flight she helped herself to drinks and packets of snacks. The plane taxied to a halt where a middle-aged man in jeans and t-shirt helped her down the steps into a waiting limo. All this was accomplished without speaking to anyone, not that she was in the mood for idle chat. 

This was not home. The rugged scenery was of the South West, maybe even south of the border. So it looked as though she was getting a full week not just a weekend. She would have to be home preparing for a new job by Saturday or Sunday at the latest. 

No longer convinced this fantasy stuff was for her she decided to give it one more try then pack it in. It was a little worrying how much all this was costing and who had paid for it. Roberta couldn't have done so. Was the irresponsible woman paying for this on a credit card? They didn't even seem to know what her fantasies were. 

Driving up a long dirt road they eventually came to what looked like a ranch house. The driver opened the door, "Come on out, you've arrived." 

Melanie squealed with pain on feeling the hot ground under bare feet. He scooped her up easily cradling her in his arms. Their heads were together as he walked with her around to the back of the house. 

He held her high with her breasts scrunched under his face, the dress no protection. He said nothing but grinned as the twin mounds squirmed like wild creatures, trying to escape, in rhythm with his long strides across the yard. 

The barn was dark, too dark to see details after the bright outside world. He let her down into a stall onto a concrete floor. It was cool beneath her feet. As he closed the gate she realised she had slid from his arms out of the dress and he was carrying it away with him. 

It hadn't been much but it was all she had. In the stall there was nothing but some straw. Gathering it together like a nest she tried to make a bed. 

'What now!' Melanie thought. The drug administered by Sophia was wearing off and all that had happened was coming into a nasty clear focus. "What the hell am I doing here?" she exclaimed to the walls of the stable. 

As though magically answering the question a singsong voice chimed up surprising her. "Hi! I'm Sandy and I'm here to help you settle in. Before the training starts I will be teaching you some basics." The tall blond bimbo announced cheerily. 

At last someone to talk to. Melanie didn't know what to say. The woman seemed so vacuous was it worth trying to communicate. She needed to tell someone her pussy had been assaulted without her permission and she wanted to go home. Gritting her teeth she asked. "What do you mean the basics?" 

"Oh! All sorts of exciting things honey! Come on lets go get some chow then I'll get you something to wear." She said with a broad smile. Already Melanie missed Sophia and Sapphire. There didn't seem a way to shut off the inane chatter; no off switch on the life sized Barbie doll. 

If told only a few days ago she would be sitting around a stranger's home completely naked the idea would have seemed ridiculous but here she was eating and patiently waiting for the next humiliation. 

"We just have to fill out some paperwork and then get started. Those boobies look great where did you have them done?" She asked while pumping her own huge tight mounds of silicone. 

"There mine, I mean natural," Melanie said slowly enough for the little brain to understand. Sandy seemed to be impressed. Melanie was glad it kept the tiny brain thinking about the idea of them not being man made like her own. The daft thing didn't seem to be able to think and talk at the same time. 

Melanie wanted to tell her to hurry up and get some clothes but already she had become used to wearing little and now nothing at all. 

The young woman wore a miniscule flared skirt with a thong, revealed every time she swished around the kitchen. The top hardly covered her ample breasts; something a streetwalker would find embarrassing. Melanie dreaded to think what this woman might present as suitable clothing. 

At last it seemed they were going to find out what she thought a fantasy weekend should be. When a blood sample was taken dire thoughts of what that penis had deposited inside her surfaced. She shook her head trying not to think about it. 

In a backroom Sandy handed her a pair of ridiculous shoes. The heels were five maybe six inches. "Here, let me help you. This is the first lesson, how to walk in heels," Sandy offered. 

There were no other clothes just shoes. Melanie wobbled around until able to balance. It was a small achievement but still it was something, even if completely useless in the real world. She imagined, with a jaded smile, walking in to the new job as Administration Manager on Monday wearing these. It would certainly make an impression. Perhaps she would compromise and wear some clothes too. 

Giggling at the idea brought forth from Sandy a bright tinkling laughter. The laughter and enthusiasm were bringing Melanie around from the previous despair. "Well done girl. Now take them off and we'll try some positions." Sandy told her. 

What a provocative statement Melanie thought. Not even a steady boyfriend would dare suggest that. Melanie thought a good position would be the bimbo's neck in her tightening hands. The anger in those thoughts sobered her for a moment. The poor girl was trying her best. 

True to her word Sandy demonstrated how to stand with breasts thrust out and hands clasped behind her head. Melanie burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of the position and Sandy joined in, with a silly happy laugh. 

"This shows off my breasts so well, don't you think?" she asked innocently. 

"Yes, you'd gain any man's attention Sandy," Melanie mocked. 

"Oh No! Not any man, just my master," she complained in surprise. 

Melanie didn't believe she was expected to sit like that. Sandy was sitting on the floor with legs splayed out almost sideways then lifted her hips as though presenting her sex. 

Telling herself they weren't much different to yoga positions she enjoyed Melanie relented under the cajoling of the enthusiastic little Barbie doll. She elicited a promise of some clothing first. 

Giggling like a naughty school girl she followed the earnest sincere demonstrations. Next was how to squat on the floor with back arched back, again pushing out her large breasts. 

All were designed to present her body in a variety of sexy poses. It didn't take long before Melanie thought of those women at the Roman party last night sitting at their master's feet in these lewd poses. 

She sat on the floor with her legs spread out wide, head bowed, with hands gripping her shins. From this to another, then another pose, each one held for some minutes while she learnt to stretch her body. 

It was a good work out, especially after being cramped in the box, even though the poses were lewd. Repeating these in a gym would bring the place to a halt with cheers and applause even when dressed in a leotard. Despite herself she was becoming aroused thinking of herself like this in the banqueting hall. 

Darkness had descended and Melanie was becoming tired, desperately wanting to rest. To hasten the end of the training she jumped to it when Sandy gave her a command. It didn't matter that she felt like a dog performing tricks, she wanted to show how well she had learnt the poses to end the session. 

Woken up early by Sandy, bright and perky as usual, breakfast was eaten and she was ready for a change. The man who had collected her from the airport strode in.  

===

"So Melanie, you did well yesterday but today the real training starts. I'm sure you've learnt there's just one important thing, obedience. Well now you have to do more than that." The trainer told her. 

She was getting a bit fed up of this. It was time to go home. 

"You must have pissed off Bernard for him to have sent you here so urgently. The training regime is his usual specification, well you'll soon see." Jimmy smiled. 

"He was pissed off! I was the one accosted." She didn't want to use the word rape, not even sure if it could be called that in the circumstances. "By a porn star in front of everyone, the other night." she began angrily. 

He stopped her with a hand in her face. "Whoa there girl, what do you think you were doing there in the first place?" 

"It was supposed to be a naughty weekend and I didn't think much of it!" She interrupted. 

"Just one moment. If you talk out of turn you will be punished. That is one you are owed already so don't go for another," he told her sternly. It was enough to shut her up and listen. 

"We're not talking about some fancy weekend here this is for life. I know you've not been trained or have much experience, maybe you're not even sure why you're here, so let me tell you. Bernard bought you off a finder." Seeing the dumb look on Melanie's face he explained. 

"A finder is someone who finds women needing to pay off debts, or in trouble and need to disappear, or whatever. He will settle the debts or fix the trouble for a fee. The finder then sells the woman to a rich man and makes a tidy profit. Another part of his expertise is in matching the right woman to the right man. It's a matter of temperament, body shape, fetishes or whatever. You with me so far?" he asked. 

Melanie nodded slowly, not sure she wanted to believe all this. The self delusion had been stretched far too thin for her to pretend anymore. She had been fooling herself, avoiding reality; unable to face up to what was happening. The drugs helped but they had cleared from her system. 

"I don't know where you came from or what your problem was but the finder paid for you and sold you on to Bernard. He owns you. He is your master. That won't change until he decides to put you up for sale when someone else will own you. That's how it is from now on. In the mean time you need training for whatever your master wants you to do and that is where I come in." He looked her over, assessing her mind rather than her body. 

She looked shocked. Was all this news to her or had it only just sunk in? "The sooner we start the sooner you get back to where you belong. Let's see what you learnt yesterday." The trainer firmly barked the one word command expecting her to jump quickly to thrust out her breasts. 

Melanie stood quit still staring at him. She tried not to believe it but everything that had happened began to slot into place. She felt so stupid for denying it all. It was too much to take in and began to sway on a decent into a faint. 

James roughly pushed her over a chair. He slipped a whip from his belt and slashed at her bare bottom repeating the phrase, "you will learn to obey." 

From then on she switched off to concentrate on his orders. With each word she quickly jumped into the positions holding the pose until commanded, again and again. 

It was obvious Roberta had nothing to do with this. A single thought rang through her mind over and over again. 'It's all a mistake,' whirled through her mind on a continual loop with the terror numbing her mind. 

Satisfied with the now compliant woman he looked her over. Was it the silky smooth skin, the waist looking too small to support such large breasts or the long blond hair and sultry looks? What was the best asset needing emphasising? 

The more difficult objective was determining how far she could be pushed before breaking. Keeping just this side of the line was the aiming point. He didn't want to make the same mistake made with Sandy. 

The client had arranged for her to disappear after she had ruined one of his companies through fraud. The instructions had been to turn her into a Barbie doll to be returned to serve as an obedient slave. He wanted her to remember she had been an important high flying executive and suffer every moment of servitude. 

The training had started too soon after the surgery. The poor thing had been in shock after having her body drastically altered and ended up a mindless compliant doll. James would find a buyer for her as there were plenty out there wanting an obedient big breasted blonde Bimbo. 

At least the law would never catch up with her as she was unrecognisable and no longer the self assured business woman she had once been. 

*** 

Melanie was in the stable exhausted from another day of physical exercise ready to collapse into sleep. The demoralising thought that she was owned by someone kept her in a state of shock. Given no time to think it was only now, near exhaustion that she could bear to bring it to mind. She had been bought and sold! 

She had fallen into this horrifying trap by accident. Roberta had only rolled her into that packing case to get her out of the way of the removal men. So what went wrong? She vaguely remembered being loaded onto the truck but nothing more. Someone must have found her in that packing case tied up. Could it have been the mysterious finder or had she been passed on to him. 

None of that mattered now. She was in the clutches of these rich men who thought they could own a person like a racehorse or pet. "Shit!" Those women at the party were like her, owned, slaves. What was so frightening was how docile they were. 

"I'm a slave!" she said to the empty stable. There, she had said it. She was a rich man's pet being trained for his use. Exhausted she fell into a fretful sleep waking suddenly from one nightmare after another with a silent sob. 

With little sleep and no time alone during the day there was never a chance to think or to plan. Could she escape from here when she hadn't a clue where she was? Miles from anywhere, no money, no clothes, it would be impossible. She would have to wait for someone to rescue her. There's no family and she had recently moved away from friends and colleagues, so there was just Roberta, her only hope. Could she find her? 

*** 

Another day arrived with Melanie in a deeper state of despair. She was reduced to trying hard to avoid punishment by quickly obeying the trainer. On command she had learnt to jump to it. She followed orders however degrading for she had learnt to obey. 

Night seven was scratched as a line on the concrete floor. A little whimper escaped the usual self-control on realising it wasn't just the physical indignities she suffered but something more dangerous was happening. Little by little her self-respect had been whittled away leaving her evermore vulnerable. 

She had reached the lowly state of those poor creatures in the banqueting hall and felt so useless. It was impossible to fight it. As she fell asleep images of human furniture surrounded her, whispering to her, mocking her.  

===

Roberta arrives on the scene: 

Roberta felt pleased with her performance convincing Eddy to accept the hastily invented story. She had pretended to be in trouble, needing to escape the area, and was now in a plane being sent to a rich mans home as a servant. 

That's what Eddy had told her, but she knew the truth. The two stupid oafs had told her all about this nefarious business. The thieves had carted off the two friends belongings and mistakenly carried Melanie with them. In their panic, finding Melanie in a packing case, they had taken her to Eddy. He in turn sold her to a rich man as a slave not a servant. 

Now Roberta was on her way, also sold, but Roberta was not as compliant as her friend and intended to free her. It had been over a week since Melanie had gone missing but the police hadn't been much help. Not that Roberta had dared tell them the whole story. They thought it a case of missing property not a missing person. 

Roberta didn't have much of a plan. She intended to find her, get back home, and that was about it. Roberta was aware Melanie was a submissive and would be susceptible in a slave role and was worried how she had survived what was in effect a kidnapping. 

Feeling guilty over her stupid mistake Roberta had jumped at the idea without thinking it through, until now, on a plane to an unknown destination. She was inclined to make sudden decisions and relied on Melanie's sensible advice to talk her out of making a mistake. It was no good worrying now she would just have to get on with it 

Roberta noticed they were travelling south but how far it was hard to tell. The landing was on a private strip out in the desert. The pilot didn't push but guided her out of the plane in a hurry to take off again. A jeep was waiting and so she walked toward it wondering what trouble she had gotten into this time. 

"Jump in," Joe cheerily told her. The jeep sped away with Roberta's arse slamming into the seat. A cloud of dust swirled behind them and in the distance a ranch house with barns and stables appeared through the shimmering heat haze. 

Roberta stole glances at him while trying to study the terrain in an attempt to establish where they were. The ranch house didn't look as impressive as expected. If this was a rich man's home he didn't exactly flaunt his wealth. 

Relieved to be out of the morning heat she stood by the air conditioning tempted to lift the back of the dress to cool her bare ass. He seemed a rugged yet cute kind of guy. Under different circumstances she would have considered getting to know him. 

She had expected some old pervert, someone she could kick until he told her where Melanie was. With this one she considered a more tactful approach was called for. "So, what now?" she asked. 

Joe looked her over assessing this new trainee. The finder had been right; she needed a lot more work before selling on to a master. Apparently she had blustered her way in to the finder's office with some preposterous story. If he hadn't been warned by a friend what she was up to he would have sent her on her way. 

"So you're in trouble at home and need to get away for awhile. You can't get much further away than this," he told her. 

Holding up a hand to stop what might have been a repeat of the boring story he added. "I don't want to know. I'm a trainer and you are here to learn the rules. Be warned though. If you don't keep to the rules you'll be sent straight back to where you came from," he lied. 

"First thing is to get some details down. Health and safety is important so you need to provide some information, then we can join the others," he smiled. 

His disarming smile left her feeling more confident than on the journey. He hadn't given her a chance to say anything which was fine while finding out what in hell went on here. 

This wasn't what she had expected when thinking of being sold as a slave, though it had been hard to imagine such a thing happening at all. Images of the Far East or a harem in the Middle East came to mind, but not this. 

Roberta plonked down in the large padded chair before a computer screen. "Ouch!" she screeched. 

"Be carful there are scorpions around here," he told her. He watched her jump up rubbing her bottom under the dress and laughed. "Not here in the house though. It's an old chair but comfortable. Just some of the horse hair stuffing working its way out I guess." 

Roberta gave him a withering look then turned to the screen to read through the list. He didn't seem to be much of a threat and the rules looked innocuous enough. By the time she got to five her eyes were so heavy she couldn't keep them open. Next moment her head fell against the keyboard. 

A hypodermic needle in the seat of the chair had injected a tranquiliser. "You look almost innocent asleep," he sighed. Taking a hold of her hands he pulled the inert body out of the chair, up and over his shoulder. 

In the stable he lowered her gently onto a pile of straw. He slipped the dress off then pulled the panties down with the shoes coming off entangled with them. Unclipping the bra was next. Careful not to snag the skin he snapped manacles over wrists and ankles. 

Joe pulled her hair up to fasten a collar around the neck and snapped its lock shut. The manacles were connected by chains and one of these he clipped to the collar and locked that too. 

He rolled her over and tightened a thick leather belt around her waist. He pressed a button on a small black box attached to the back of a belt to test the battery. The chains slowly slipped through it pulling on her wrists and ankles. Once her legs and arms had been pulled up behind her back into a hogtie it stopped. 

From a back pocket of his jeans he pulled out another control box, looking much like the one on her back. Joe pressed the release button watching the chains reverse allowing her limbs some freedom. Her arms flopped to her sides where she lolled, snoring loudly. Next he filled a water bottle and a food container. 

Glancing around the barn he noticed the two slaves had cleaned it and strode out to check on them. Walking in to the practise barn he found Sandy at the computer busy paying bills and generally looking after the accounts. At least she was making herself useful until he could find a buyer for her. 

Curiously the last two prospects had declined the offer, saying the price was too high, so he was considering placing her into an auction. This was tricky as he kept a low profile with none of his customers ever meeting him. He arranged for a friend to fly the slaves in for training avoiding direct contact. Taking Sandy to an auction would necessitate meeting potential buyers and getting his face known by too many people. 

Melanie was practising slave positions on a soft leather mat. He watched her settle over a dildo fixed to the floor poking through the mat. Easing her torso down over it he watched fascinated as it disappeared into her body. With strong legs she began to push up the length of the dildo until only its head was still inside her. 

The movement was repeated with deliberate downward thrusts squashing her cheeks on the mat. A slave wasn't allowed to look directly at a master but he could see the pleading look in her eyes as they implored him to give permission. 

She didn't have to say anything, he knew what she wanted. Since the chores had been completed she had been practising movements designed to strengthen her body. She could almost split herself in two and hold most awkward positions for an hour. 

Taking on this large dildo was meant to improve inner muscles as later she would have to grip a small one. On her back with legs spread she would have to push it almost out then pull it back in. An hour a day over the past week had improved her grip to perfection. 

All morning she had been teasing her body and mind so now she was ready. All through the routines she was only too aware all this was to improve her sexual ability for a master. This thought was humiliating yet added to the arousal. 

Looking almost directly at him she pleaded with her eyes for relief. He smiled at her adding to the torment. It was all the more frustrating that he had her so well trained she couldn't orgasm without permission. The harsh punishment for disobedience had her completely subdued. 

After just a few days the state of slavery had been accepted so the trainer found excuses to punish Melanie, pushing her further into the role. Now all she needed was to learn the techniques and duties of a slave. She was nearly there. 

Little sobs of anguish were choked off knowing a punishment would be earned. The trainer looked at her waiting to see if she could bring herself under control. She tried hard to obey though desperately needing to plunge down on the dreadful thing. Instead she slowly, agonisingly, controlled the descent and upward movements. 

Intently looking out of the corner of her eye for permission she almost missed it, a slight nod of his head. The damn thing was almost lost in eagerness to finish. Plunging down on it her bottom hit the mat, burying the hated thing deep inside her pussy. 

With great will power she lifted her body up its length and again plunged down. Faster and faster, with frenzied movements straining leg muscles she fucked herself on the large dildo. Eventually she pushed her body over the edge into the abyss. 

Her head fell to the mat with the dildo still deep inside. Pulling her legs together she squeezed it, imagining a master had used her. This thought was bad enough but knowing the trainer had merely nodded his head to allow this tremendous orgasm crushed her self worth. 

Lying on the mat gasping, Melanie shivered at the thought of having learnt to use her body for someone else's pleasure. A master could watch and control her in a number of lascivious acts, or have her pleasure him using an uninhibited well trained body. 

Having learnt to avoid punishment she was now addicted to receiving the rewards of obedience. With a well trained mind and body the orgasms were tremendously rewarding. There was no need for punishments for she was now pushing herself into the role of slave. 

Sandy turned from the computer to submit to the trainer. Kneeling on the floor, with legs spread, she linked her fingers behind her head to thrust out a pair of large breasts. With head down, buried in the long blonde hair, she stole a look at him. He was watching the new slave performing lewd tricks. 

At least she no longer had to submit to such degrading exhibitions. As a mature woman wearing a Barbie doll outfit and talking like a stupid teenage cheerleader it was bad enough. The trainer considered her broken in enough to leave her alone and even help in the training. 

With a flick of his hand she was dismissed to continue with the task of organising the accounts. This demonstration of submission was the first of the day so from now on would be left alone to get on with humdrum tasks. 

Roberta came round feeling drowsy. The fine chains didn't clank or restrict movement much but were a potent symbol. She sat looking at them knowing they were a message declaring stridently she was a slave. Being in a barn sleeping on straw added to the effect meant to make her feel insignificant. 

She had been lulled by his welcome into thinking this would be easy. She had presented the image of being just another soft pliable woman easily subdued but he had seen through the deception. 

Taking advantage of his absence she decided to explore the place as well as needing to walk off the effects of the drug. With determination she stood and looked around. One of the other stalls looked as though it was lived in with what looked like a nest in the clean straw. Roberta hoped to find Melanie or at least discover a way to escape this dreadful place for when she found her. 

There were more chains, harnesses and what looked like torture instruments hanging from the walls. What might be lurking inside the cupboards she didn't want to think about. 

A brazier with branding irons was set up in a stall giving her a moment of anxiety on realising what this meant. On examination she found it rusty so it was probably for effect. Looking around she wondered how Melanie had survived this frightening place. 

A small door set into one of the barn doors squeaked. Looking out into the bright sunlight she blinked and saw the coast was clear. With small steps on bare feet she daintily crossed the yard between the house and two other barns forming a square. First she would take a look at the outside world to try and establish where this was. 

Looking for hills or some landmark might help. The flat land shimmered in the heat revealing nothing but scrub and she wondered why a farm would have been built out here in the wilderness. A city girl could only wonder but there were more important things to consider especially as there was no convenient town nearby. No taxi to call! 

Where was Melanie and where was the trainer. Who else was here and would they help or hinder an escape attempt. Feeling confident from such clear thinking she stepped away from the barns to take a look behind them. Perhaps in that direction there might be something useful. 

As soon as she stepped away from the square a noise like a motorised toy car started up. Roberta turned around startled for it sounded loud in the silence. The creaking of heating metal distorting under a hot sun was all she heard, apart from the soft mechanical sound. 

Even the insects had the sense to stay out of the midday heat. Where was the noise coming from? Before she could dismiss it as irrelevant she felt the chains to her feet tighten. Intending to reach down to them the movement was caught short. The chain to her wrists had shortened too. 

Her head was being pulled back and her knees had to be bent to gain some slack. Intending to return to the relative safety of the barn she stumbled unable to straighten her legs. Roberta knelt on the ground before she tripped over for she wouldn't be able to defend herself with both arms being pulled behind her. 

It carried on, despite struggling, until she lay in the dirt face down. Both lower legs had been bent upward behind her with hands still being pulled up her back. When there was little slack left in the chains it pulled her head back. 

This reminded her of putting Melanie in a hogtie a week ago, only she was lying naked in the dirt, not on a soft carpet. This was no silly game either. The whirring mechanism had stopped at last with the chains gripping her naked body tight. 

"Damn!" she shouted. "Damn! Damn and shit!" One last struggle was enough to show there was no escape. Deflated from the previous elation she tried to hold on to the anger, her only defence. 

Joe looked out of the window. As expected the latest acquisition was out in the yard face down. 'Eat dirt slave,' he thought and almost laughed at the corny saying. The training and the isolation of the abandoned farm had an effect upon him too. Perhaps he might use her to break the monotony. 

She didn't have an owner yet and might provide some conversation before being broken. He had become sated with sex from pliant women. Even that palled after awhile. 

Perhaps that was why most masters sold them on after awhile, hoping the next one might be something special. It was ironic that the possibility of having something special, the individuality, was being trained out of them. 

Once enough money had been earned he would look for a partner, not a slave. Someone to share his life with, someone equal, someone interesting and challenging was needed. "Oh well, back to work," he sighed. 

"Slave, Doll, with me," he told them. 

Joe led them out to where Roberta lay. 

She didn't sob rather she gritted her teeth, not caring what came next. 

He pressed a button on the control box through the jeans pocket. The chains began to slacken giving her the chance sit up and massage her limbs. 

"Help the slave back to where it belongs, in the barn," he told them. When she opened her mouth with an obvious protest he slapped her face. It was dirty, so covered in dust Melanie didn't recognise her. Pulling a crop from his belt he pushed her over into the dirt with a boot and flicked it across her bare ass. 

"No back-chat slave. You are here to learn the rules and obey them. No complaints, this isn't a health farm," Joe told her. The calm voice was more threatening than a shouted command. He spoke from experience and a sure knowledge that all would submit eventually; easily or the hard way. 

Following them into the barn he watched the new one looking for signs of arousal from rough treatment. There weren't any so added this to his assessment of how to break her. 

In a corner of the barn he clipped the collar to a dangling chain. She stood on tiles over a drain. He turned on the hose and began to wash the dirt form her face and body. The long hair flew around her face with the jet of water. 

She would need shaving too, he noted, as the water bounced over her pussy. This ordeal had no effect either but he would find out the weakness soon. It was hot in the barn and the water wasn't exactly cold yet sometimes the humiliation of being hosed down in a stable like an animal was enough. 

It was the little discomforts and humiliations that did it in the end, not the obvious punishments with a whip or spankings. Subtlety was the key to making a woman into a well behaved slave. 

Dressed in a ball gown being humbled at his feet did it for one while another would be brought to heel in a short skirt showing off a pair of frilly panties. One slave may be turned on while another would be deeply embarrassed. Either way it would be used against them. 

"Look after it and fill it in on what I expect of a slave, even a trainee," he harshly said. 

Shining clean Roberta was led to her stall. Sandy had no sympathy for a young woman running away from trouble only to land in deeper shit. Having suffered at the hands of those self-important wealthy, so called masters, she wasn't going to add to the woman's suffering either. 

Melanie stroked the hair away from the new slaves face. She gasped out loud. "Roberta! What the hell are you doing here?" Her eyes were wide with shock showing white in the gloom of the barn. 

It had been too easy to succumb in this threatening place, especially with the thought of no escape bearing down on her. Suddenly confronted by a friend from that other world, it all came flooding back - its normality and moral fences began to reform. She took a step back trying to cover her naked body with both hands. 

"Trying to rescue you, fool!" she tried to laugh only it was an ironic cackle. She lifted both hands showing off the manacles. "Not doing a very good job of it. Guess I need a clever thought out plan, any ideas?" she plaintively asked. 

"You give up too easily. I'm surprised you got this far." Melanie said, sounding more like her old self. 

Roberta told them her story guessing the two thieves had given her away to the finder called Eddy. She explained he ran a brothel and probably recruited desperate women if they were suitable as slaves. 

Melanie told them about the bizarre house she had been delivered to and how she had been sent for training as the master required complete submission. She was nearly there too only her friends presence gave her fresh heart to resist. 

Seeing the two friends cuddling each other for comfort Sandy suddenly felt very alone. For once she let her guard down and told them her story. How she had stolen company funds for the sheer hell of it. "Just because I could," she said. "Doing it under the very noses of those pompous men was thrilling," she laughed. 

Melanie noticed the silly voice had been dropped and she no longer lisped. She wondered what the woman had been up to on the computer while supposedly helping with her training. When the trainer wasn't around she was constantly playing with the thing.  

===

"Sure, we'll find a way out of here," Melanie said to her friend. 

"You going to join us? Three intrepid slaves fighting for freedom?" Roberta asked Sandy. 

Sandy looked away, once more donning the coy little dumb blonde look. 

Melanie knew her well enough to figure she was retreating into an act. So that was it, she was acting a part, to fool the trainer, no-one else. She didn't think it was just a mental escape from this awful place either. The woman was planning something.

Chapter 5 

Roberta's training starts 

"She's planning something I just know it. Every time we're alone Sandy's on that computer, until he comes in, then she switches the screen to the business accounts. If he gets close she asks him some mundane question which he runs from. He hates to even look at the accounts let alone check up on her," Melanie explained. 

"Maybe she's planning to escape but that doesn't mean she'll take us too," Roberta pointed out to her friend. 

"She couldn't just leave you to be sold to some stranger and I'd be sent back to that awful man," Melanie complained. 

"Are you sure about that? How can someone be a slave these days! Surely you could have just walked out and reported him," Roberta said. The skepticism was still there but less definite. 

"OK! We can't walk away from here, across the desert, but if we worked for some guy in a big house we could get away surely," she said in exasperation. 

"You don't know what its like," Melanie snorted. 

"What was it like then?" Roberta asked, trying to get her to talk. 

"I'd rather forget about it," Melanie said, once more. She looked away not wanting to recall the images of such a painful memory. 

"If we don't get out of here I'd like to at least go to the same place as you. I assume you're going back to the same place?" Roberta asked. 

"You don't understand, of course I'm going back to that man, he owns me, I'm his slave," Melanie said, through gritted teeth. "You won't be asked where you want to go, you'll be sent to whoever pays the highest price," Melanie told her angrily. "We are slaves and you had better get that into your head or you'll have a hard time of it," she warned her. 

"Help me out then, tell me what its like," Roberta sighed. She looked around the barn wondering if it might be preferable living in a comfortable house, even if it meant submitting to a so-called master. It would be uncomfortable sleeping in a barn, in a stall, on a bed of straw. The thin old blanket didn't hold back the prickly straw enough or keep out the cold. 

Melanie looked at her friend seeing the look of wretchedness that was so unlike her and relented. She was always full of fun and this look of misery was too much to bear. She decided to tell her what had happened since they played around packing ready to move into the new apartment. 

She intended to convince her friend it was possible to become a slave and that's exactly what they had become. They were slaves and the sooner she realized it the easier it would be to withstand the training. 

"It was a big expensive house, richly decorated in a Roman style. He must have had a thing about ancient Rome. Anyway, I just had to do as I was told it is as simple as that. It was at a party that I got into trouble and was sent here to be trained. All the slaves were dressed in brief outfits showing off their bits. Yes, me too, in front of about twelve men and their slaves," Melanie recounted. 

"Of course I didn't want to, I just had to wear what I was given, that's what slaves do," she explained. "When first there I gave in because I was drugged, but later the oppressive atmosphere of the place pushed me into just going along with it," Melanie said, trying to excuse her behavior but still feeling pathetic for giving in so easily. 

"The master expected me to obey him and I just went along with the other slaves. You know, when in Rome!" Melanie tried to make light of it. 

"A large muscular man strode in, dressed as a gladiator or Roman soldier or something; he was a part of the entertainment. As he strode around the room he recounted an epic battle with a big loud voice throwing in bawdy remarks. He goosed or even spanked the slaves as he toured the room which I decided to avoid." 

"My master was away somewhere so to keep out of the way I squat at another mans feet, hoping to be missed out." 

"Yes, I suppose he was well built and handsome in a rugged sort of way. He stopped behind me and goosed me like some of the other slaves. Unlike the others I pushed away from the man in front of me trying to get up ready to give the stranger a telling off," Melanie shivered at the memory. 

"He must have realized I was a novice and didn't know how to behave like a disciplined slave. The other slaves just kissed the head of his cock, or pretended to depending on their master's wishes," Melanie said. 

"You're joking! These women were dressed as slaves and actually kissed a strangers cock at a party?" Roberta laughed, in embarrassment. 

"Not all of them. Some masters ordered them to pretend. He only stopped for a moment at each one, all the time blaring out the story. Anyway, before I could make a fuss he grabbed my hips and thrust in. In my pussy of course! I didn't have a chance to do anything I was still bent over trying to get up. Of course I didn't enjoy it!" she complained at another of Roberta's interruptions. 

"Everyone was watching and cheering as though my being fucked were a part of the show. I wasn't ready for him either," Melanie suddenly cut off, reddening with embarrassment. 

"So who were you ready for?" Roberta chuckled. She prodded her friend's shoulder with a hard finger, "Come on you can tell me," she goaded. 

"This nice guy, I was leaning on his knees. Don't be so crude, I wasn't doing anything naughty to him. Because I wasn't his slave that's why! I know, I can't help referring to myself as a slave but after that experience and the training here, well, you'll find out," Melanie sighed. 

"He wasn't my master so of course I wouldn't have blown him, as you so crudely put it," Melanie said, in a far away voice, then shrugged her shoulders. 

"You mean you would blow a man's cock just because you're told he's your master?" Roberta asked her friend. She looked at her with eyes wide in astonishment. She knew this woman had refused to blow a steady boyfriend. Melanie just didn't like it and wouldn't do it. 

"I've been practicing," she said, and lifted her head with pride, before realizing what she had admitted. 

All Roberta could do was flap a pair of open lips in astonishment, unable to produce a word. 

"I haven't told you the worst bit yet! I'd been talking to this nice man, didn't ask his name, getting on fine with him. When the Roman entertainer thrust in I was pushed into his lap. The nice guy watched, with a look of surprise turning to amusement, while I was being fucked by that nasty stranger. His piercing blue eyes held mine so I couldn't close them or look away. I couldn't say a damn thing either. What could I say, 'do you mind if I brace myself on your knees while this complete stranger fucks me', Melanie angrily spat. 

She calmed herself and continued. "I tried to keep my head from nodding in rhythm with the man's powerful thrusts. It was terrible, the most humiliating moment of my life. A man I wanted to get to know, that might have helped me escape and he was watching me being taken by a stranger." 

"I felt like a stupid bitch on heat pounced on by a stray dog. I remember now, I gripped his knees real tight when that stranger shot his load into me. I must have cum too for I slumped across his knees. Hell! No wonder my master was so angry," Melanie giggled. 

"Next day my master sent me here to be trained," she said. 

Roberta managed to close her mouth and shook her head to clear it. This was certainly not the virtuous young woman she had shared an apartment with for two years. The giggle sounded as though it might rise to hysteria so she interrupted with another question. 

"What happened to you here?" Roberta asked. The anxiety in her voice surprised her. A little shiver shook her naked body. The sun was going down and it was getting cold but it was a touch of fear that shook her. 

"We get up early so best get some rest. If I know you you'll fight him all the way so save your strength, get some rest. Shush! You aren't me so he'll use a different tactic on you. He fits the method to the slave," Melanie said, trying to avoid telling her. 

Melanie didn't want to frighten her friend or reveal how degrading the training had been. Since her friend had turned up she had become aware of how much she had given in to it and how debased her behavior had become. It had been easier to accept out here with no-one to compare with or anyone to judge her. 

"Here, let's snuggle up, to keep warm," she offered. Roberta looked as though she might refuse the close contact, as they were both naked except for a leather harness. She quickly relented. It was easy to see they both needed the closeness as a comfort, their only comfort for the foreseeable future. 

Next day, just before dawn, Sandy woke the two girls with a shake of their shoulders. They were like spoons in a draw and had been all night, only waking just long enough to turn in unison. Melanie pulled Roberta up onto her feet for she found it particularly hard getting up so early and wasn't used to such rough conditions. 

"You're kidding me right?" Roberta asked when she was led to a metal grid set into concrete in the middle of the barn. Melanie held onto Roberta's shoulders as the young woman tried to position her ass over the hole. 

"Try not to make a mess, we have to clean it afterwards," Melanie explained. Roberta splashed her legs but got most of her waste down the hole. She would have to manage for herself next time Melanie warned her. Roberta looked at the metal grid set into the concrete hardly able to accept she had just peed and shit into it. 

She led her to an open corner of the barn where Sandy had already showered. 

"A shower next," Melanie yawned. The cold shower stung Roberta like a cattle prod. A startled look together with the stiff pose left her looking as though she had downed a jug of Turkish coffee in one. 

"Shit! Why didn't you warn me?" She came from under the freezing water shivering, pulling a thin cloth that tried its best to be a towel, around her body. 

"I'm used to it I guess, its cold water off the mountain," Melanie said. 

They ate breakfast together in the exercise barn, a bowl of cornflakes with dried fruit and nuts. The two friends were ravenously hungry and licked the bowl out. Sandy was more polite and so Melanie suspected the woman had a supply of contraband food in the house. After all she was processing all the orders for supplies on the internet. 

Melanie helped her friend clean and oil the leather harness. "You'll need to keep it clean or you'll receive a punishment," Melanie told her. 

"What kind of punishment," Roberta asked. It wasn't just idle curiosity she needed to know what to expect from the trainer. Melanie just shrugged her shoulders so she asked Sandy who was also noncommittal. 

"What kind of training is it," she asked both of them. 

"The trainer will decide that. Better get on with your exercises," Sandy reminded Melanie. 

Melanie casually walked over to a blue padded mat placed on the concrete floor. The mat was a reward for concentrating on her slave positions. With finesse she lowered her naked body into a personal slave position. She sat firmly on her bare ass with legs stretched out almost straight and both hands rested lightly on her thighs palm upward. Her head was lowered in supplication. 

She held the position for three minutes with a good judge of the time after so much practice. She lifted her head pushing it back, thrust out her breasts and pushed back her arms to lift her sex off the floor as an offering to a master. Again she kept this awkward position for three minutes. 

Melanie was pleased not to have wobbled for a thigh muscle sometimes let her down. Her body was certainly more flexible under the strict training. She purposely didn't look at her friend so as to concentrate and not be distracted. She was sure Roberta was watching and hoped her friend was impressed being proud of the moves she had learnt. 

Roberta gawped at her friend practicing what looked like the Karma Sutra without a partner. It dawned on her these were the slave positions they had mentioned last night. These rude poses were obviously meant for a master. It was so demeaning, how could she present her sex to someone like that? Not even to a husband would she expose herself so crudely. 

Roberta couldn't bring herself to interrupt for it was so fascinating. The concentration it took to complete the moves was also a means of controlling her. Melanie was obeying a master even though he weren't present. Melanie was impressing upon her own mind that she was a slave through these exercises. 

It had become his body because he owned it and that was reinforced when she obediently exercised it according to his command. Roberta shuddered with a sudden fear of its efficiency but couldn't help admiring the symmetry of the training. 

Was this what it meant to be a slave? If Melanie was just an object owned by someone then of course showing off its best features made sense. It wasn't hurtful to Melanie, showing off her sex, for she was just an object like a piece of furniture. 

She could imagine a rich man explaining the features of a rare seventeenth century cabinet then turning to another of his possessions. He would point out to his guest the even ripple of its pussy lips as they flowered and the pertness of its breasts. 'Go ahead and tweak its nipples to see how large and hard they grow.' 

Roberta shivered again wondering if that momentary dream might be her fate after the training. She believed it was possible to be reduced to an object in a rich mans collection. In their luxurious well guarded mansions, stolen works of art are hidden away for their eyes alone. So now she knew some collected women as art objects. 

They kept them in golden cages, isolated homes, unvisited except by like minded men. Some were so well trained the slave no longer thought of escape. 

Melanie shuffled backward a little and lifted her bottom right off the mat. Poised over the centre of the mat she hesitated in preparation. 

Taking a deep breath she used her imagination to work up the enthusiasm to continue. With legs stretched out sideways there was little time left before thigh and calf muscles started to tremble and give way. If she didn't do it soon her whole body weight would drop to the mat with a thud and she had to complete this move in a smooth controlled movement. 

Melanie lowered herself an inch and almost gasped on feeling it. Just in time her sex had started to flower. Another second and she would have plunged out of control with her whole body weight onto the mat. The large dildo would have pierced her cruelly. 

With practice the descent was under control and her sex was ready for it. The tip of the black dildo nudged her lips ready to push them aside as though hungry to feast in her sex. It wanted to gobble her up but she held back. There was little strength left so it would soon have its way with her. 

As her thigh began to waiver she knew the black monster had won and would take her yet again. It was a pleasant little game she liked to play. A gasp was heard and she thought it was from her lips. Looking up she saw Roberta looking down at her. 

The expression of revulsion on her friends face took her by surprise and overrode her concentration. It was no good though, she was committed with no going back. There was no turning back from the black devil she would have to consume it or it would wreck her. For a moment she wondered if she dare sit on it, but that would be worse. 

Melanie had forgotten how disgraceful this looked the first time it was seen. Her friend hadn't even contemplated such a degrading act so this must be a big shock to her. Melanie dragged her thoughts back to the exercise shutting out her friend's dismay. 

Her muscles couldn't hold her up any longer so she would have to start now. With great strength of will and well built muscles she slowly lowered her body onto the dildo. It was fixed to the floor and stuck up through the mat. 

It squelched noisily into her. Of all the times to make such a disgusting noise this was the worst. Her friend stood staring at her. With legs stretched out sideways she had impaled her vagina on the large phallus. It was clear to see its full length was now stuck up her cunt. 

If she could have sprung up and run across to the far corner of the room to hide she would have done. However, she was impaled on this sword and could only extricate her pussy from it by careful manipulation. She didn't have the strength to pull herself up its length and it was impossible to roll backwards off the damn thing. It was fixed to the floor and was inflexible so rolling forward was out too. 

All she could do was hump the damn thing in front of her friend. She pushed up, an inch or two, with her hands. It was just enough to start raising her bottom off the mat using thigh muscles. Nervous in front of her friend left her pussy drying and tightening up. 

Lifting up its length she managed to reach as far as its head, knowing this was as far as she could go. Slowly lowering aching muscles down its length brought forth an agonizing squish of air and pussy juices. It sounded loud in the room where all that could be heard was the quiet hum of a computer. 

Her breathing became more rapid as she struggled upward again. Pushing with all her strength she managed to rise up its length to just under its head. It looked as though her pussy was reluctant to let go or it had swallowed something too large to spit out. Again she slid down its length. She hoped this time it would trigger the spasm she hoped for. 

After a random number of lifts it would spurt into her and then deflate enough for her to slide off the damn thing. Would it take her to the limit while in front of her friend? She hoped not to be riding it for much longer. At last she felt it spurt into her with a fake orgasm and fake sperm. 

She rolled backward for it to squish from between her lips. As it did she gave a loud pussy fart. Unable to continue with the exercises she pushed her head down to the floor covering it with both arms. Silent sobs rocked her shoulders and chest. With her friend here came the realization of how depraved she had become. 

Roberta couldn't move forward to comfort her she just stood trembling in shock. How could a sensible and honorable young woman like Melanie behave in such a disgusting manner? She had squatted on that dildo so casually as though she were practicing a demure yoga position. She had ridden the damn thing hard like a professional. 

It was the fact that her sensible friend had been trained to do this willingly, rather than the act itself, that shocked Roberta so much. If they could reduce Melanie to this state of degradation in two weeks what chance did she have to withstand their abuse? 

The trainer walked in and complimented Melanie for having started practicing so early. 

Roberta watched Melanie recover from her embarrassment, forgetting Roberta's presence altogether. Her friend's eyes shone with pathetic gratitude on receiving the compliment. 

The open unaffected deference the two women showed him had to work on Roberta too. He turned to Roberta and she very nearly jumped to attention. It was partly from fear of the unknown punishments he might dish out as well as a grudging respect that was growing in her. 

She didn't like it but had to admit he had tamed these two women and she was next. She was in no position to refuse his orders so stood still awaiting the worst. 

"You have no choices, none at all and have had none since stepping foot on this farm. You are a slave and will be trained to obey, do you understand? You can disobey but you will be punished for such stupidity until you learn the lesson, obedience in all things," the trainer stated. 

He flicked the back of her legs with a crop eliciting a hiss of anger and a look of disdain. He pushed a button on the remote control in his jeans pocket and watched her struggle against the tightening chains. As they drew together she knelt on the floor with both arms pulled up her back. The chains continued tightening about her body with a steady drone of an electric motor. Eventually her limbs were pulled into a hogtie position.  

===

She gave up struggling at some point with a heavy sigh. It was no good the thin chains looked fragile but wouldn't give. All he had to do was press a little button and she was helpless. Besides that he looked strong enough to over-power her or beat her into submission. There was nowhere to run to so this would have to be endured. 

"You were whipped because you refused to answer a question promptly. You have been confined because you reacted with dissent, you hissed at your master," he stated. 

"You will learn to respond promptly to your master and to show respect at all times. Do you understand?" he asked, annunciating each word carefully. 

"Yes, master," she quietly uttered, as though trying out a foreign language. She sniffed. Thankfully he interpreted the sniff as resulting from a sob. She certainly sounded contrite but then how else could she react while hogtied. 

He picked her up in a pair of muscular arms carefully placing her on a table. He looked into her eyes. "Don't look at me, look down at your masters' feet," he shouted, at her. 

So unexpected was the shout she looked down at once. Leaning over her naked body he lightly flicked her back and bottom with the crop. 

Roberta screwed up her face from the sting, refusing to let it beat her. 

"What have I told you?" he asked, reverting back to the firm deep tone. 

"To respond quickly, show respect and to look down, master," she nervously responded. 

"Very good," he said. He stroked her bottom and back between the chains soothing the reddening flesh. He started to rub oil over her skin and to massage the tight muscles. The other two looked on wondering if they too might experience this privilege soon. 

He was standing behind her and she was lying on the table helpless, with little chance of the other two rallying round if she yelled for help. She felt the cold belt buckle nudge her sex when he leaned in massaging her back. So her sex was at the right level for him to easily take it, if he wanted her. 

A palm was caressing in a circular motion her cheeks. Fingers were massaging between both cheeks down to her crotch and she was trying hard to ignore every disturbing sensation. A trickle of oil escaped his light grazing touch which she felt dribble across over-sensitized lips. 

Was it his touch opening her up or was it her vulnerability that brought such lively vivid thoughts. Either way she was travelling past just being available, becoming inexorably drawn toward insatiable desire. 

All she could hear was the rush of her breathing loud in her ears. In a deep breath was pulled then out it was expelled in a long low outpouring. Giving up holding back she let out a little trembling sigh. The sound became a personal expression of being pleasurably occupied, developing into a moan of pleasure. 

Her head filled with delightful sensations demanding absolute attention cutting off all other awareness. Roberta grunted short guttural sounds like a pig happy to be routing in muck. 

Fingers were exploring her sex hunting down the inner button that would fire her rocket. A finger gently pried its way up her rectum as it opened up unafraid after all reservations were abandoned. 

On the table her body undulated like a snake moving fast over flat ground. The trainer held her in place with fingers in her asshole and vagina while a free hand gripped the harness. 

Roberta had a deep set orgasm. Inside was a voluptuous mess of sensations driving feelings, overriding the mind to drive out all rational thought. 

As hard and as suddenly as it hit, the storm subsided. Roberta tried to stretch only to feel and hear chains grinding. In a moment of sudden anger she cursed the man who had forcibly done this to her. It should have been with a man she loved and wanted to give her body to. 

He took her face in both hands and kissed her gently on the lips. She couldn't strike out or hold him tight. She became conscious of a need to hold him and to have him hold her. He had taken her body but she wanted him to know she wanted him to have it. 

She puckered her lips for another soft kiss. Her mouth opened to him as had her sex. She felt his tongue lock on to hers and she held him. Her tongue entwined his and it became so very meaningful in her helpless state. She focused on this point of contact as though their bodies were in an all embracing seal of approval. 

Tears dripped down her cheeks and he held her chin in one hand while dabbing at them with a tissue. As though a barrier had been crashed through she felt a rash desire to give everything to him. "Thank you master," she sighed. The words were a small sign of the total surrender she felt overwhelming her mind. 

"Thank you master," she said again. The words were repeated to test the sincerity of meaning and to roll the unfamiliar words around her tongue for the sensual feel of them. It was difficult to understand. Was this it? Had she lost her independence? Was she now a slave?

Chapter 6 

Escape 

Roberta hadn't yet recovered from the deepest and most satisfying orgasm of her life. The trainer pressed a button on the remote control tucked into a jeans pocket releasing her from the hogtie position. With the whine of an electric motor her limbs unfolded leaving her prone on the table. 

He put a hand on the limp form to prevent it falling off the table for the new slave was only semiconscious. The sweaty dishevelled state of the attractive young woman, spread over the table, left her looking like the leftovers after a banquet. 

Roberta moaned from the touch of his cool hand on her hot skin. She wanted to shout the word 'Bastard!' at him for what he had done to her. Not for giving her the most wonderful orgasm ever but because it had happened while she was tied up helpless and he had made it happen so casually. 

He should have been in animal lust too not taking advantage of her when helpless while he nonchalantly sent her into such an overwhelming state of sensual need. He had taken her over so very completely she had hardly known where she was or what was happening. How dare he send her into paroxysms of ecstasy in such a careless way! 

She had lost control before a friend, and a stranger too, leaving her feeling sullied as well as angry. Her mouth was too dry to speak otherwise she would have earned a punishment for speaking out of turn for showing her master disrespect. 

He let her calm down, gauging the mood by the breathing rate, which was deep and heavy. He could feel her heart beat return to almost normal through the light touch to her back. Her back was marked by the crop but its redness would disappear by tomorrow for they had been light strokes. 

"You have learnt something about punishment and reward, Slave," he said, emphasizing the word 'Slave'. He noticed she didn't balk at the provocative word this time as she lay without even a flicker of an attempted censure. He had given the woman more serious issues to think about. 

He flicked her ass with the crop to gain attention. She hardly moved. Her hands and feet drooped over the edge of the table and it was these that flickered into life first. "What have you learnt from your master, Slave," he demanded. He watched her suck in a deep breath attempting to gather spinning thoughts. 

"To respond quickly and show respect, master," she sighed. 

This wasn't perhaps the best answer but she was struggling to say anything at all. He smiled and stroked her hair. It was matted with sweat like the rest of her body, she needed a shower. Before that was allowed she would need to work hard. 

Roberta looked up through half open glazed eyes. Seeing her friend looking at her she concentrated on focusing. Meaning to apologise for her wanton behaviour she instead looked at her in astonishment. Turning her head to the other woman she was surprised to find the same reaction. They were both looking at her not with scorn as expected but a plain look of envy. They both wanted the attention she had received and was still getting. 

The trainer lifted her off the table onto a mat. He pulled her limbs into the shape desired and once she mastered it she was ordered to stand up. "Now assume the position. Hold it for three minutes. It will seem a long time having to squat in an uncomfortable position but you will get used to it," he laughed. The young woman brought out a playful side of his character and so was enjoying the training session. 

Melanie too looked wistfully at him wondering if she could achieve a move that might impress him. It was difficult to reconcile feeling protective for a friend and resentful of the attention she was getting. 

Despite what he had done to Sandy she too was feeling jealous. Despite the earlier protests the new slut was enjoying displaying herself! She had managed to spread her legs out sideways just to impress the master. Even from a glance it was possible to see how excited she had become, yet again. 

As for that performance on the table, it was positively vulgar. Surely she wasn't really carried away like an animal in heat from just being touched by him. Perhaps she was planning on seducing him as part of an escape plan. Well, there would be no luck there for she had tried to get him off guard with sex and it didn't work. 

Roberta found it hard work despite having practised yoga positions at home. These poses were unusual and he was very demanding, making sure she held the exact position. She felt a fool when it suddenly hit her what she was doing. Each of the poses was designed to flaunt her sex or strengthen muscles for a sexual encounter. 

Thrusting out her sex, asshole and breasts was degrading but she had to do it or suffer the devious Sirik chains pulling her body into a helpless hog-tie position. Most of the positions were demanding on muscles never before used that way. Completely naked except for the chains meant her soft private flesh was now on public show. It was daunting to find flaunting her body was turning her on. 

Being ordered quickly from one position to another gave no chance to reflect on the demeaning positions. The style of training was working on her. With lots of encouragement, little teasing strokes from his finger tips, biting slaps of the crop and the ever present threat of being hog-tied, she was soon trying hard to please. 

He held his hand out, in place of a master's penis, while she positioned her splayed legs. She moved forward slightly but was puffed from the previous exertion. "Just a little more," he said. As way of encouragement he stuck out a thumb. 

She realised she was meant to impale herself on it. This morning she would have spat at him for making such an awful proposal. Exhausted, needing a shower and wanting a meal, she tried harder. On the hard floor she pushed with her hands and feet lifting her hips up in a mighty effort. With eyes closed, her teeth clenched, she felt his thumb nudge her sex. 

Or rather Roberta had pushed her sex up to his thumb to nudge it. 'I'm expected to push my sex onto his thumb!' she cried inwardly. The dreadful thought slapped her face bringing a bright red colour to it. She knew there was nothing she could do to avoid it. Like it or not she was giving in to this awful demand. 

With a desperate effort, using the very last spark of energy, she thrust her hips forward pushing her sex onto his thumb. She felt his digit slide over her wet lips and enter her gaping hole. Fingers prodded her little hard bud and it felt as though her whole sex was blossoming at his touch. She rocked back but he held her in place with that intruding thumb. 

So well balanced was she, upside down in a crab position, her whole body swayed with the slightest movement of that invasive thumb. It was both terribly humiliating to be at the mercy of just his thumb yet at the same time devastatingly erotic. It was as though he had her suspended on the end of this digit, keeping her dangling while he made up his mind what to do with her. 

Twisting the thumb round rubbed her clit. She felt the palm of his hand cup her crotch and knew this was a symbol, that he had her in the palm of his hand. He could do anything he liked with her! As his captured Slave Heart she would fervently obey. A sweet heart was an innocent girl, but a Slave Heart was anything but innocent; rather it was earthy, it was sensuous and intoxicatingly carnal. 

She felt him push a little finger into her asshole and whimpered. Roberta was a strong willed woman who would never let anyone probe her there. He was demonstrating a strong power over her, letting her know he could use her anywhere and anyhow. He had her wrapped around his little finger and waggled it inside her virgin ass. When he pulled his hands away from her crotch she collapsed back onto the ground. 

"Come on, up you come, one more time, one last effort," he told her. This time he slipped a bench beneath her torso to rest on. Her feet were flat on the floor with both arms dangling beside it. She had at least learnt not to close her legs and kept them wide open. It gave her crotch a chance to cool down too. 

"Open wide slave," he told her. He watched her mouth open, unaware of why or even that she was doing it. He slid his cock between a pair of strong sensuous lips. Her eyes flickered open showing the whites in a state of surprise. She shouldn't have been startled for hadn't he just fucked her mind, pussy and ass. Admittedly he hadn't used those holes extensively but the last hole was inevitable. Her luscious pouty lips were an obvious target that any man could imagine using. 

He was getting to use them, though only briefly for there were more pressing requirements to train her for. Still in a state of need she sucked on it like a pacifier drawing the head into her mouth. He felt the powerful suction and almost gave in to the enticing thought of an orgasm. 

He shoved deep into her mouth hitting the back of her throat. She choked and the vibration hummed tantalisingly over his hard penis. He withdrew until the head was in the grip of her lips. Again he plunged in. Despite the rough treatment she tried to accommodate him. This test of her resolve showed how easily and thoroughly she had succumbed to the training. 

The trainer had guessed correctly over which buttons to press and how deeply to press them. Caresses with occasional whipping brought her to a state of need that made her susceptible to his demands. The stimulation from pain needed to be sparing for this one. Her friend Melanie was the other way round. 

He looked at the two women looking on with longing looks. It was very satisfying to realise they too needed his cock. They gasped in unison as his penis pushed at her throat. They whimpered in harmony with this slave as she made pathetic little sounds seeming to arise from deep within her body. 

It sounded as though his cock was nudging some kind of squeaky toy in her belly. The three women were moaning and groaning together. With gentler pushes his penis went deeper down her throat as she learnt to take it. It was often this way. Once resistance had been broken the slave quickly learnt to obey and became eager to learn new tricks. 

Roberta had run to the shower and quickly returned where she found the trainer working her friend into a state of passion. Melanie was looking so eager to please Roberta felt sorry for her despite her own dismal performance only minutes earlier. 

"Assume the position," the trainer told her. 

Roberta immediately sank to the floor to spread her legs with hands on knees thrusting out her breasts. The pride she felt in achieving this position shook her for a moment but she calmed herself with the thought they were going to escape. 

She could see Melanie enjoyed being humiliated but she never would. It was the heightened sexual sensual arousal that had brought her to heel. She knew it but couldn't seem to do anything about it. As much as she loathed it she needed to find out what else he could do to her. 

Sandy tried to concentrate on the computer but the other two slaves were in such a lather of sexual arousal it was affecting her. For the first time in ages she wanted to play with herself. He too was excited which brought together the final part of the escape plan. 

He had kept her back from the auction for a few months trying to give her time to recover thinking she had been over trained. She was less saleable as a completely broken woman but that was all and act. In just a week there was an auction and he had the audacity to get her to enter the three of them into it. 

Not only did he expect her to complete the details on the computer but expected the other two to be fully trained slaves. The usual female measurements entered onto the forms were one thing but the intimate details were humiliating. The capacity of pussy, assholes and mouths and what they could do with them were blatantly spelled out. 

The slave personality, what they had been trained to be, were crushing. It was true she had been subsumed into becoming a sex doll and her body modified to resemble a Barbie doll which made it all the more shameful. 

Sandy remembered losing the bank so much money it made her submit to punishment by the chairman rather than face imprisonment. At first she thought he would let her go after submitting to his whims but as the weeks progressed realised it was more than she bargained for. 

In a surprisingly short time she was accepting a new life as his slave. It frightened her but instead of fighting it she formed a protective personality letting him dominate her. One day she awoke after surgery in a private clinic having undergone surgery. It was obvious her breasts had been enlarged but the subtle changes to her body left her feeling all the more like his sex doll. 

Her voice had changed pitch so she squeaked like a dumb blonde and her asshole enlarged. Instead of being returned to him she had been sent here for training. Too weak to resist she gave in to become a Barbie sex doll. The boss wanted her to remember the powerful position she held, wanting her to suffer every day the indignity of being his sex doll. When the training seemed to have gone too far, leaving her accepting it, he no longer wanted her and told the trainer to sell her on. 

She shuddered at the thought of being re-designed as a sex object trained to please men and squirmed on the seat. She had been a major player in the commodities market and was now facing life as a living sex doll. She was going to be auctioned off to the highest bidder until he too became bored with a compliant blonde bimbo, only to be sold on again and again for the rest of her life. 

Sandy shook her head. This was not going to happen! She looked at the trainer playing with the new toys knowing he had his weaknesses too and she had recovered enough to take advantage of them.

"How did you know it's my birthday?" Joe asked, then realised she had complete access to the damn computer. "Well it's a complete surprise, thank you Sandy," he smiled. In one go he blew out the candles and the three girls sang happy birthday. 

Sandy chirruped like a chipmunk as usual flapping around organising the other two slaves. "No master," she exclaimed and immediately put her and to her lips, "Oh! Sorry master, did I really say that naughty word to you," she apologised with wide open innocent eyes. 

"We are supposed to undress you, it's a part of your birthday treat!" she cajoled him, still able to seem coy and girlish. 

The three slaves laughed and giggled while removing the t-shirt, stealing touches of his tanned muscular body. They cooed approval on removing his pants commenting on the wonderful penis they revealed. "I'm first because I was here first and it was my idea," Sandy told the other two. 

They squabbled over him in good spirits until he clapped is hands for their attention. "This is supposed to be my treat, so be good girls and get on with it," he laughed. 

They had him on the floor of the training room on a soft mat. Sandy massaged his shoulders licking his neck and face like a pet puppy. Melanie massaged his chest and stomach while licking his nipples. Roberta was meant to be massaging his legs but took a hold of his balls to practice another art she had been taught. Her mouth opened up to suck his cock into her mouth and couldn't wait to deep throat him. 

She dived on him consuming all eight inches of cock, unhesitatingly pumping up and down its length, taking a lung full of air around its head on each upward stroke. 

Sandy watched him carefully. He was nearly there and at his most vulnerable. Massaging both hands she stretched his arms a little further slipping both hands into a restraint. Melanie, right on cue slipped a loop over an ankle then struggled to get the other tethered too. 

"Hey! Stop that, what shit are you playing at! Fuck! Let me go right now!" Joe demanded. 

"No!" Sandy said with force right into his face. Despite the incongruously squeaky voice the unexpected power in it stopped him struggling. "You can stop now Roberta," she said. "Roberta!" 

She continued slurping on his cock, sucking every last drop from his balls then licked him clean like the well trained slave she was. Sandy had picked Melanie to help tie him up and had been right to. Roberta was all talk. She seemed the least affected, especially next to her submissive friend Melanie, yet after all the protestation she submitted the most. 

Sandy clicked her tongue in exasperation and ignored her. "Listen to me! You are in serious trouble and we don't have much time," Sandy was pleased to see he was taking her seriously. 

"Over the internet I've alerted the FBI to those slave traders where suck girl here came from. I hacked that bastard Finder guy's computer and passed it on to the Feds. It won't take them long to find your name and locate this place. I can get you out of this, if you do as I say. Is it a deal?" she spoke clearly and forcibly. 

He didn't look scared but thankfully was taking it all in and believed her. The shadows of thoughts worked across his face as he tried to figure out what the deal might be. "Do I have a choice?" 

"Yes! Either you come with us or we leave you here for the FBI to collect. I've arranged for a plane to pick us up, not your friend but someone else. I just need your promise to do as you're told and we'll set you free. You can come with us or ride off into the sunset, that's another choice you'll have to make," she stated plainly. 

"What about this place? I've sunk a lot of money into it, it's my retirement plan. I've got money in the bank but not enough to live on for long," he mused. 

Sandy mentioned a figure. He laughed. "It's not that much!" 

She cut him off. "That's your share if you walk with us out of here, or should I say fly. What do you think I've been doing spending all that time on your computer? I re-mortgaged the farm and invested it. I've made enough for each of us to retire on, if you're careful," she smiled. 

"How do you know you can trust me?" he asked with a serious frown creasing his brow. 

"I know where the money is!" she laughed. The initial tension had lifted now he seemed to be falling into line. 

"Get me some clean underwear and I'm with you, Sandy. Or, should I call you, Mistress," he said, shaking his head in wonder at such a dramatic change in her. "Better stop her or she'll wear it away," he added, nodding at Roberta. Report_Story
