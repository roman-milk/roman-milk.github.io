Summary: After centuries Cupid finally finds the ONE for him. 

Note: This is a 2013 Valentine's Day Contest story so please vote. 

Note 2: Also, please note that I have created my own rules for Cupid's ability and rules of love. I did some research and concluded that there is no one story for Cupid...so I made up my own. 

Note 3: Fans of mine, this does not have any hints of many of my usual themes of submission. This is simply a love story. 

Note 4: As usual, thanks to MAB7991 for editing another of my lengthy works (this one on a time crunch). 

* 

Cupid had spent centuries helping others find love and spent almost as much time watching the love he sparked come crashing down in a fiery blaze. Not surprisingly, the plethora of failed relationships that he had been instrumental in starting had slowly eaten away at the once optimistic God of Love. 

Cupid used to love his job; watching the undeniable glow of a woman when she knows she has found the one or watching a man who had been a player his whole life quit cold turkey when he meets one that challenges him in ways he didn't know a woman could. Those were the moments that warmed Cupid's heart. 

Yet, the past thirty years had been very disillusioning for the love God. With over fifty percent of marriages ending in divorce and most teens losing their virginity to someone, they didn't even love as if love and sex were not connected. Society was crumbling right before his eyes. Sex had become a commodity and not something special or intimate. 

Cupid himself had felt the glow of love many times throughout the centuries, yet had always denied himself the inner lust that had simmered inside him. He gave people love, but never felt it himself. As the centuries flew by, the temptation to just give in to the growing hunger to love, to feel something real and concrete was becoming harder to resist. He too craved the kind of love that transcends time and existence and would give up being Cupid in a heartbeat if he ever found the one. 

Unfortunately, his mother Venus told him centuries ago, when Cupid was young and coming to grips with his fate, his gift, his curse, all true descriptors for Cupid depending on his emotional state that the rules of one sexually intimate transgression with a human. 

His mother explained: There is no black or white Cupid. Once you have consummated a relationship with a mortal you yourself become mortal and lose not only your ability to live forever, but also your unique gift to bring love to a world in turmoil. I know it is tempting my dear, but you are a beacon of hope for Mother Earth, a constant good in a world where sometimes love is the only thing keeping a person alive. 

So although Cupid had been tempted many times throughout history to cross the invisible line between Gods and humans, he remained celibate. 

Centuries of the same job became rather monotonous to Cupid and in the last few decades he had been responsible for many of the top headlines of the year. It started accidentally when his shot missed the woman he was aiming for and hit Marilyn Monroe instead. Who turned around simultaneously and fell instantly for the playwright Arthur Miller. Cupid thought maybe the God of fate Moirae had spun her magic and Cupid figured it was meant to be. It wasn't until the 1990's that because he had become so bored with his job that he became rather mischievous putting together couples who logically made no sense. The first was Lyle Lovett and Julia Roberts, then it was Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. Once Cupid got started he couldn't stop, he cast his spell on Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton, Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Macaulay Culkin and Mila Kunis, Renee Zellweger and Jack White and most recently on Katy Perry and Russell Brand and David Cross and Amber Tamblyn. 

2013 should have been just another year like so many proceeding it, where Cupid controlled his inner hunger to feel love, yet for Cupid 2013 would be both the ending of one life and a start to another. 

..... 

Cupid was feeling melancholy as the month of love started. Valentine's Day had become a commercial fiasco just like Christmas and Easter, the true meaning had been skewed over the years so much that the true meaning was just a facade. Valentine's Day was supposed to be a day for people in love to celebrate their lives together...no more and no less. 

No lame cards that had replaced love letters; no flowers which had become a symbol of how much a man loved a woman, which Cupid thought hilariously ironic considering flowers die (a rather depressing metaphor for love, although since so many relationships ended in epic failure Cupid assumed it was more foreshadowing than metaphoric). 

Also, as soon as Christmas ended, the plethora of Valentine's Day overpriced propaganda hit the stores just adding to Cupid's frustration of how real love was portrayed. To make matters worse, Cupid had always resented how he was portrayed in the media. The long historical image of him as a baby with wings was ludicrous, he did not look anything like a baby, nor did he have wings. The truth was much cooler. Cupid could not fly, but he could teleport anywhere in the world. It was the best perk in this crazy gig. Cupid had traveled every inch of this glorious world. He had seen empires rise and fall and seen the happiness and horror that mankind can experience from every possible way imaginable. He could also make himself invisible which was a pretty sweet party trick. 

Cupid was, of course not a baby, but a handsome man who had not aged a day since his 25th birthday. He wasn't a Greek God like Adonis but he was very handsome. After centuries of plying his trade as the bringer of love had given him the gift of understanding exactly what any woman wanted. He also understood that all women were different but for the most part they fell into four basic categories. 

1. The pleaser: This was a very generic descriptor that hits a wide range of women. 

A. The Insecure Syndrome These are women who often had limited relationship experience and clings onto someone who gives her attention, even if it is not positive attention. Often they end up in a loveless marriage with an overbearing loser. They stay married because it is better to be with someone than to be alone. 

B. The Daddy Syndrome The pleaser could also be a woman who grew up with an authoritative old school father and a stay at home, do EVERYTHING, mother, who was bound to fall for a man just like her father thus continuing the cycle. Ironically, she is often oblivious to the reality that her man walks all over her (also an insecure syndrome trait). 

C. The Needy Syndrome The needy may sometimes be a mixture of an insecure and a daddy syndrome or just someone who ALWAYS needs to be with someone. They often settle (actually all types of pleasers usually settle) because they NEED to feel important, to feel NEEDED even if they are treated like crap by their man. 

2. The diva: this too is a descriptor that can hit a broad range of diverse woman, all beautiful and all dangerous. 

A. The Bitchy Snob Syndrome As the title suggests, these woman are bitches. Odds are they are daddy's girls with lots of money who have always gotten what they wanted and expect relationships to work the same way. A bitch is self- centered and quickly angered and usually as fake as she seems to be. Yet, if you can break past her fierce outer shell, she can be tamed from lion to kitten rather easily. 

B. The Seductress Syndrome These woman are always on the prowl. They ooze sex appeal and they know exactly how to use it to get what they want. They tend to drift from man to man and are not interested in settling down. They like to be noticed and put up on a pedestal, yet they almost always have ulterior motives. Tigers in the bedroom, they are the toughest to tame. 

C. The Social Butterfly Syndrome These woman love to be the center of attention and are uncomfortable when they are not. They are gossip queens, fashion obsessed and live and breathe Cosmo Magazine. They too love to be noticed, but unlike the seductress they want to be wooed, wined, dined and treated like the Goddess they have convinced themselves they are. 

3. The lost: these woman have lost who they are or never found it and can't break out of the cycle they find themselves in. 

A. The Slut Syndrome Somewhat of an unfair label, as men in the same syndrome are called studs, but these woman find self-worth through sex. They believe love and sex are synonymous. Many of these women hate themselves in the morning when they realize who they have slept with and yet fall into an unbreakable cycle as they search for their twisted view of love. B. The Abused Syndrome The saddest of the syndromes, the abused have been in one or more horrible relationships where they were bombarded with physical or emotional abuse (often both). Unfortunately, often their self worth becomes nothing and they clutch onto even the smallest fragments of a loving relationship, creating often a love-hate relationship. 

C. The Bitter Syndrome These woman are the toughest to label as their reasons for their current situation can very. Most often it is because they have been betrayed by a man they loved who cheated on them. It could be a string of men who lied to them or just one relationship that ended horribly bad, either way these woman put up a shield, usually through sarcasm and cold stares that keep men who could warm them at a distance. Sadly, these women are most likely to end up alone because their hard shells have become impenetrable. 

4. The hopeless romantic: Of course, for every pessimist, there is an optimist, and thus we have the women who dream of the perfect man. 

A. Serendipity Syndrome These women are eternal optimists who know their Prince Charming will come. They read their daily horoscope, are usually sweet as pie, and love Nicholas Sparks. They probably still have all their teddy bears from their childhood and still watch every princess Disney movie imagining they are Snow White, Belle or Cinderella. 

B. White Wedding Syndrome These women have had their wedding planned since they were teenagers or younger. They have hand sketches of their perfect dress, know the exact shade of blue their bridesmaids will wear and has already written her vows a thousand times. The church, the hotel and the honeymoon are already meticulously planned...the only variable missing is the groom. 

C. Saving Herself Syndrome These women are a dying breed unfortunately, as sex itself has become less meaningful than it once was. Teenage girls are blossoming earlier than ever and movies, magazines and music have created a culture value system that uses sex as a weapon. The few of these who remain are usually shy and reserved or idealistic and independent or religiously moral...sometimes all three. They resist the temptation to conform to today's expectations as they save themselves for their perfect man. 

Cupid understands women completely and could easily woo any woman he wanted and yet he refrained because he knew the consequences, yet the longing to feel the love he so freely gave to others had grown to epic new heights during the past few years. 

So Cupid wasn't looking for love when it happened, but like the powerful arrows he shot so many others with, when it happened he was unable to resist the temptation, unable to break the spell and unable to deny the inner hunger to feel love...true love. 

..... 

It was February 11th, a Monday, and Cupid was in a rather foul mood like he usually was the week before the big day of love. His last arrow was shot rather spitefully at a man in a three piece suit being rude to a chubby waitress. He chuckled at how the conversation changed from hostile and loud to sweet and tender in an instant...the man never knew what hit him. 

Cupid was watching amused at the sudden shift in behaviour of the rude man when a young woman with tears in her eyes crashed into him spilling her coffee on him. 

"I am so sorry," the young brunette apologized; clearly, she had been crying. 

Cupid instantly felt a spark with the young woman, he replied, "No, I am sorry. I just stopped in the middle of the sidewalk." 

She pulled a Kleenex out of her purse and began wiping Cupid's jacket. "I am not myself today." 

"I never am," Cupid joked back, the true meaning of three simple words so much more complex than the young woman would ever understand. 

She laughed conservatively, "Well sorry again," and she began walking away. 

Cupid didn't want this brief moment to end, but no words formed in his head and he stood there speechless as she walked away. He watched as she got on a subway train assumedly headed to work. Cupid intrigued, followed her, an unexplainable burning inside him, pulled him after her. 

She exited the subway, her tears done falling but she still looked pale as a ghost. She entered a big building and Cupid, turning invisible, continued following her into the elevator. Cupid could literally feel her pain and knew without a doubt she had been betrayed by a man recently. Reaching her floor she got off and Cupid followed her to her office where he learned she was a secretary at a law firm. 

Over the next hour, Cupid learned her name was Beth, she liked her coffee black, she was a diligent worker, yet even though she hid her pain well to others, he could feel her inner turmoil and the hope of love fading. 

At the time, Cupid had no intention of falling for her as he soon would; he was just trying to mend a broken heart. He left Beth alone and found the nearest flower shop where he purchased a beautiful bouquet of red roses. He wrote a sweet yet simple note to make her feel worthy of the love she so greatly deserved. 

Beth, You are beautiful and deserve nothing but the best. Your secret admirer 

The delivery was scheduled for after one pm and Cupid went along his merry way with his arrows ready to spark the flame of love in other couples. Unfortunately, Cupid lacked focus. Every time he saw a woman or man who could use their fire to be lit, Beth's face popped into Cupid's head. Unable to focus, he decided to return and check on Beth. 

As Cupid was walking towards the building, a strange fate that he usually controlled occurred, as Beth appeared with another woman assumedly heading to lunch. Cupid smiling, attempting to turn on his rusty charm, joked as they passed, "I am paying attention this time." 

She turned to Cupid startled and laughed, "You survived my attack." 

"Barely, it was kind of like a hit and run," Cupid flirted. 

"Sorry, I didn't want to be late to work," she replied, "Ummmm...." 

"Cupid," Cupid replied, before realizing he had not made up a suave fake name like he usually does. 

"Cupid?" Both women repeated simultaneously. 

He quickly covered, he had made the mistake before decades ago, when he fell for a woman back in the fifties and almost gave it all up, "Yes, my parents were real romantics when they named me." 

"I love it," Beth said meaning it, a romantic at heart too. 

"Well it sucked during high school," Cupid joked. 

"I imagine," the other woman said, before adding, "We need to get going Beth." 

Beth seemed a bit disoriented, feeling a tiny connection with Cupid, a small sense of serendipity tingling inside her, "Um, right, ok, it was nice to meet you officially, Cupid." 

"You too," Cupid replied, shaking her hand and almost calling her Beth, a name she had not yet given him. 

Beth cheeks went slightly red at the brief moment of intimacy, before she let go of his hand and started walking with her unnamed friend. 

Cupid watched her go and as hoped, Beth turned around and gave a quick glance back, the ultimate tradition that had lasted for centuries to show an interest or curiosity with someone of the opposite sex after a chance meeting. 

Cupid gave a nod, smiled and Beth quickly turned back embarrassed that she was caught. 

Cupid thought about turning invisible and following her, but decided not to, instead he went to get a bite to eat. As he ate, he couldn't get Beth out of his mind. She seemed so genuinely sweet, unlike the fake personas of so many people of today. Society had become so superficial and Valentine's Day was one of the most superficial days of all. How many men bought their girlfriend or wives presents because they are suppose to and not because they wanted to? How many women caught on to the fact that the gifts were not sincere? Yet, thinking of Beth, Cupid couldn't get past her sweet vulnerability. 

Cupid decided to turn invisible and be there when the flowers arrived. 

Beth returned to work a few minutes early and instantly got to work. Cupid watched her, knowing it is the small things that really defined a person. For example, starting work the moment you arrived instead of waiting until the very last moment; her voice on the phone with clients always so soft and sincere; the way she looked everyone in the eyes even she spoke to them even though inside she was hurting. Beth was exactly the kind of woman he would want to date if he was a real human. 

The flowers arrived a little after two, later than expected but that was ok as it gave Cupid time to just watch the trivial day to day activities of Beth, only confirming his already strong feelings that she was a genuinely good person. 

Beth's expression when the flowers first arrived was complete shock. Her ex had never bought her flowers of any kind during their relationship, but if there was ever going to be a day she assumed it would be today. Usually he gave her his adorable puppy dog look when he was in the dog house and Beth always gave in, but he also knew she was a romantic at heart. Her anger at his betrayal began bubbling and she was just about to throw the flowers in the trash when something inside told her to read the note. 

Grabbing the envelope, Beth opened it and read the card. 

Cupid watched as Beth's face changed from one of inner anger to one of genuine intrigue. 

Beth looked around her gaze ended where Cupid was standing; it was as if she was seeing past Cupid's invisibility. 

Cupid could feel her looking into him, even though it wasn't possible for her to see him. 

The moment lasted only a few seconds before the girl from lunch interrupted the surreal moment of unknown intimacy. "The douche bag sends flowers, are you f- ing kidding me?" 

"I don't think they are from him, Cassidy" Beth replied, handing her the card as she tried to figure out who else would send her flowers. 

"Wow," Cassidy said, praying this wasn't another manipulation of Jared's. Cassidy was happy Beth finally dumped that loser as Beth deserved someone so much better. She asked, "Do you think it was from that Cupid guy?" 

Beth's face flushed as she again looked directly where Cupid was, as she remembered the spark that she felt when they touched hands. "Impossible. He doesn't know my name or where I work," Beth replied, wishing secretly that he was the secret admirer. 

Cupid watched in voyeuristic awe at the reaction his flowers had brought. His feelings towards her only increased as he felt feelings inside he had not felt in decades. 

"Well whoever it is the man has taste. These are the nicest flowers I have ever seen," Cassidy said, trying to build up her good friend's spirits.  

===

Beth moved her nose to the flowers and let the sweet scent of nature envelop her. She hadn't received flowers in years, high school actually, and her heart suddenly warmed after being so cold just hours ago when she learned of her boyfriend's cheating. 

Cupid knew he should have left then and continued on his way, continue with making love connections around the world, but he couldn't leave. Instead, he watched her all afternoon. He smiled as she continued to be distracted by the big bouquet of flowers and smiled even more at how such a small gesture had completely changed her day. 

Beth meanwhile was so preoccupied with who sent the flowers that she was a bit out of it the rest of the afternoon. The thought that she had a secret admirer was really exciting and yet she didn't want to get her hopes up as it seemed rather farfetched that she would get a secret admirer on the exact same day she leaned of Jared's unfaithfulness. Yet, the glimmer of hope was enough to have Beth able to let go of her anger and move forward. 

That night, Cupid watched the city from high in the sky. From his perch above it all, everything looked so small and insignificant, yet it was the small seemingly trivial and insignificant that mattered the most in life. People got so immersed in their problems, whatever they are, that they didn't enjoy the simple things in life: watching the sunrise or sunset, seeing a child's smile, having simple banter with a stranger while in line or just saying thank you when someone opens a door for you. Instead people give a person the finger when they get cut off, are oblivious to the true beauty of the world and allow the petty things in life to bring them down. 

Yet, Cupid knew what really mattered...in the end when someone was on their deathbed their regrets are always the same: I didn't spend enough time with my family, I never told people how much they meant to me, I never got to see this glorious world; it was never: I wish I made more money, I wish I worked more, I wish I was alone more. That is the great irony of life; people generally don't know what they want from life until it is too late...even though the meaning of life is so damn simple. 

Beth meanwhile, put her flowers in a vase she bought years ago and had never gotten to use. She had supper, watched one of her favourite romance movies Serendipity and pondered if her two brief moments with Cupid were serendipitous. On her way home, she kept looking around as if sensing he was around. Yet, she didn't see him again and although it seemed virtually impossible that Cupid was her secret admirer it was what she kept hoping, the optimist she was. 

Ironically, Cupid was there near her the whole way home and he couldn't believe how often she seemed to be looking directly at him even though he was invisible. For Cupid, who was used to being invisible and not being noticed, it felt strange to think that Beth could somehow sense his aura. 

That night, as both went to bed, they both wondered about the other, both unaware the other was thinking the exact same thoughts. 

..... 

Tuesday, Cupid had originally planned to teleport to San Francisco, the best place to be mischievous before Valentine's Day, yet he couldn't deny the rare sensation his heart was feeling every time he thought of Beth. 

So instead, he pondered how to bump into her again. 

Beth felt much better about her sudden break-up with Jared a day later, realizing suddenly just how bad he was for her. He was selfish, insensitive and distant, yet like many people in a relationship you can't see the forest from the trees when you are right in the middle of it. Yet, as soon as you leave the forest the problems become crystal clear. 

Cupid got up early, got to Beth's desk and using candy hearts he wrote, 'you intrigue me'. He knew it was corny, yet had a hunch that Beth would appreciate the corny sweetness of it. He waited patiently, until Beth arrived looking more alive than yesterday with her hair down today which somehow made her seem even more beautiful. She also was wearing a green sweater, black skirt and beige pantyhose, something that Cupid had always thought were sexy and enhanced a woman's legs. 

Beth got to her desk and froze. She stared at the three simple words for a long time as if unable to comprehend their meaning or that they were for her. She again looked around for the person responsible, again looking right through Cupid, as if sensing her secret admirer was nearby. 

Cupid felt a chill go through his entire being as he felt Beth look his way as if she was seeing through the invisible shield and into his lost soul. 

Cassidy arrived at Beth's desk and saw the candy hearts. "Well this definitely isn't Jared." 

"That is for sure," Beth smiled, confident Cassidy was right. But if it wasn't Jared, who was it. 

Beth took a picture with her phone before taking a candy that said 'be mine' and popping it in her mouth. 

Cupid watched with silent satisfaction at the joy his small acts of kindness brought to Beth as he teleported out of her office. The rest of the morning he went to work creating three new love connections, all which he felt confident could stand the test of time. Beth had somehow inspired him and rekindled the flame of love. There was a time being the God of Love was fun and he had lost it, yet suddenly it was back, suddenly he could feel love in the air. 

All the while, Cupid thought of Beth and her sweet smile. He avoided her all day, but her pull was too strong and around four he found himself in front of her building pondering how he was going to bump into her again. He thought and thought and yet nothing came to him, the irony that the God of Love couldn't think of anything romantic not wasted on him. He sighed as he watched a young teenage couple walking together holding hands. His sigh switched to a smile as he wondered what such a simple thing like holding hands with Beth would feel like. What would kissing her feel like? What would giving up everything to make love to her feel like. He was the world's oldest virgin and suddenly the idea of ending that curse of celibacy was becoming more tempting...the apple ripe for the picking. 

Beth walked out into the fresh February air with a smile on her face and warmth in her heart. She put a candy heart in her mouth; she still had a dozen in her pocket, as she contemplated her day. Her work day done, she wanted to know who this secret admirer was, yet on the other hand the secret revealed may be a great let down and thus she also didn't want to know who he was. She felt like a character in another of her favorite romantic comedies You've Got Mail. She was Meg Ryan and her secret admirer was Tom Hanks. Suddenly in the mood for a movie, it was cheap Tuesday after all, she got on the subway deciding she would get a bite to eat and hit a movie alone...and suddenly she was ok with that. 

Invisible, Cupid followed Beth. He wanted to just walk up to her and say hi and yet he had no idea what to say after that. 

Beth and Cupid both had dinner at the mall, Cupid cautious to not be seen, but when she headed into the movie theatre he saw his opportunity. He knew instantly in his heart the movie she would be going to and bought a ticket to the same show confident he was right. He got in the popcorn line before her and hoped she would notice him. 

Beth usually didn't buy popcorn, too fattening, but she decided what the hell and got in line. She was in line a minute, maybe two, when she glanced to her left and froze. It was Cupid. She turned away and looked back to make sure it wasn't a mirage. He was even handsomer than her memory of him and she couldn't help but stare. Usually shy and reserved, Beth continued to break her usual habits as she heard herself say, "Cupid, is that you?" 

Cupid's heart warmed that she took the initiative to speak to him. Turning around and acting surprised, he said, "It's you again." 

"Yes, I am stalking you," Beth joked. 

"Well, I am flattered," Cupid smiled, before offering, "Come join me in line." 

Beth paused a second before moving to him. 

Cupid began, "I just realized I don't even know the name of my stalker." 

"I'm Beth, Beth Peters," she offered her name. 

"It is nice to officially meet you Beth," Cupid smiled, again taking her hand. 

Both of them felt a spark on contact. 

"Are you here by yourself too?" Cupid asked, already knowing the answer. 

Beth admitted, "Yes, I don't usually go to movies by myself, but I just felt the urge to come to the theatre." 

"Weird, me too," Cupid added, "this is a rather serendipitous meeting then." 

Beth couldn't believe he had used the word 'serendipitous', especially because that was exactly what she was thinking. Beth joked, "Yes, maybe the real Cupid is watching over us." 

Cupid thought, if you only knew, but said, flirting a bit more than he usually would, "Well I must have been shot with his arrow." 

Beth's face went beet red at the forward flirtation. 

Cupid sensing her embarrassment asked, "So what movie are you going to?" 

"The Love Game," Beth answered, her tone implying it was an embarrassing choice. 

"Me too," Cupid said, showing her his ticket. 

"What are the odds," Beth said, of bumping into him again and going to the same movie. She was beginning to feel like Kate Beckensale's character in the movie Serendipity. If that was so, Cupid was a very good looking John Cusack. 

"Apparently, really good," Cupid joked, as it was his turn in line. "What would you like?" He asked. 

Beth protested, "You don't have to." 

Cupid replied softly, "I know I don't have to, but I want to." 

Beth felt a rush of warmth at his kindness and said, "Popcorn and a coke." 

"With real butter?" Cupid asked. 

"Is there any other way to have it?" Beth asked back. 

Cupid ordered a large popcorn and two-drink combo which ironically came with a bag of candy hearts. 'Serendipity' Cupid thought to himself. He handed the bag of candy hearts to Beth and said, "Here, take my heart." 

Beth couldn't believe the crazy coincidences of the day, it really was as if Cupid or serendipity was at play. She stammered, "T-t-thanks," as she began to wonder if there was any way possible Cupid could be her secret admirer. 

"You are welcome," Cupid answered as they began walking to the theatre where their movie was to play. 

Trying to learn more about this mysterious, sexy man, Beth asked, "So what do you do for a living?" 

Cupid was ready for the question and had created a couple dozen pretend career jobs over the years. "I work in psychological therapy," Cupid answered, which wasn't a complete lie if one really thought about it. 

"Oh-oh," Beth responded. 

"Oh-oh, what," Cupid asked concerned. 

"If you try to psychoanalyze me I am petrified what you may find," Beth joked. 

"I don't psychoanalyze until the third date," Cupid quipped back, as they headed to theatre seven. 

"This is a date?" Beth asked, hoping it was. 

Cupid stopped and looked into her hazel eyes and asked back, "Is it?" 

Beth's heart fluttered with excitement as she replied with a smile, "Well, a date usually includes dinner." 

"Popcorn doesn't count?" Cupid slyly smiled. 

"I don't know," Beth smiled, trying to play slightly hard to get. 

Cupid loving the playful flirtation asked, "So how about we break the rules of dating and do it backwards?" 

"I'm listening," Beth smiled, her whole body giddy with the excitement people only feel on those rare moments of romantic potential. 

"Movie first, and a late dinner second," Cupid offered. 

"It's a date," Beth agreed. 

"Great?" Cupid replied, as they looked into each other's eyes, both feeling a longing they couldn't deny. 

Beth finally stammered, feeling a slight dampness in her panties, "W-w-we should probably get a seat." 

"I suppose so," Cupid laughed. "It is tough to watch the movie from the hallway." 

They entered the semi-dark room and Cupid slyly took Beth's hand. The intention way more meaningful than their first two brief touches, Beth's heart began to pitter-patter like crazy. 

The hand holding lasted only a minute but any lingering doubt for either of them if there was a connection was gone. Beth couldn't deny the spark she felt and Cupid was feeling emotions he thought had disappeared decades ago. 

During the movie, first date etiquette and trepidation peppered both Beth and Cupid. Evening reaching for popcorn was an adventure as both didn't want to be too aggressive. It wasn't until half way through the movie that Cupid took the risk. As Emma Stone kissed Channing Tatum for the first time onscreen, Cupid moved his hand and took Beth's into his, entwining their fingers. 

Beth again felt giddy with warmth, like she hadn't felt in years, Cupid meanwhile felt something stir inside him he didn't remember feelings in...well...ever. The movie became just background noise as Cupid really began to consider seriously if Beth could be the one. It had been so long since he enjoyed his job, he had long considered being human yet couldn't find the one who could accept the reality. He remembered the last time he thought he was in love in 1953. Things were going well with Judith, well enough Cupid thought he could tell her the truth. He couldn't and wouldn't cross the line from God to human without letting her know the truth. Alas, she freaked out, refusing to believe him and ending it then and there. Yet, even after just two days, somehow he knew Beth would understand. Somehow this was different. Somehow, he sensed she was the one. 

Beth meanwhile couldn't place what it was about Cupid that was different and yet she somehow sensed he was the one. Of course, she thought Jared was the one just a couple of days ago, yet now that betrayal seemed so much less painful, as if the real Cupid knew her destiny was coming along. The stars had lined up perfectly and she somehow just knew he was the one. 

Both enjoyed the simple act of holding hands as the remainder of the movie's predictable fall in love, misunderstanding keeps them apart and finally love conquers all. Beth loved the predictability of the romantic comedy formula, while Cupid resented how simple they made love. Only he made love simple. 

Once the movie ended, the credits began to roll and neither of them knew what to do next. The perfect moment of simplicity when nothing else mattered was ending and the real world had a great way of wrecking the simplicity of life and love. 

Cupid finally asked, "Dinner?" 

"Appetizers?" Beth countered. 

"Sounds good," Cupid agreed, reluctantly letting go of her hand as he stood up. 

Beth followed and it was her turn to take the initiative as she grabbed Cupid's hand. After agreeing they would go to Tony's a Greek pub a couple of blocks away, they walked together in silence. 

At the pub, they ordered cocktails, appetizers and got to know each other. Beth informed Cupid she was originally from Texas and had two older brothers. Cupid said he was an only child and he was from up there which was the vaguest truth he could tell. Beth assumed he meant Canada and he allowed her to think that. 

They talked about places Beth wished she could go having never left the country, other than Canada. While Cupid told vivid stories of places he had been. 

Two hours flew by like seconds as they chatted with each other before it was time to call it a night. Beth wanted him, wanted to make love to him, yet knew this had been a perfect night and you don't mess with a perfect night. 

Cupid meanwhile wanted to capture this night forever as it had been the most memorable in his centuries of life. Cupid asked, "What are you doing on Valentine's Day?" 

Beth didn't hesitate as she answered her heart on her sleeve, "Something with you." 

Cupid blushed feeling a warmth he didn't know was possible. "I was hoping you would say that. How about tomorrow?" Cupid asked, getting a little too eager. 

Beth sighed, "I have plans for a girls' party tomorrow night." Beth didn't admit that it was actually a sex toy party being held by a friend of hers, an annual February 13th party held originally because all six of her best friends were single at the time and needed their own toy for the big day. 

"So Thursday it is," Cupid smiled. "Can I pick you up at five?" 

"Sounds perfect," Beth agreed, already making plans to leave work early on Thursday by working through lunch. 

They headed outside and Beth hailed a taxi. As it pulled up, way too quick for Cupid's liking, Beth said, "I had a very wonderful time, Cupid." 

"Me too, Beth," Cupid answered, wanting to kiss her but having not kissed a girl in over fifty years he was nervous. 

Beth waited for the kiss, and when Cupid didn't take the opening she offered, she took it upon herself. She leaned in and kissed him. For her it was like she had never kissed anyone before this moment, the sensation was completely new and she could feel fireworks exploding inside her. 

For Cupid any lingering doubts that she was the one he had been waiting centuries for vanished the moment their lips met. The kiss was soft and sweet, gentle and timid and yet also passionate and pure. He was in love. Some would scoff at the idea of falling in love at first sight, but Cupid knew the reality of love. When it arrived it washed through you, it didn't follow rules or logic, it just filled your heart with a sensation one had never felt before and was unexplainable with words. 

When Beth broke the kiss, Cupid in a dazed state said, "Wow!" 

Beth who although rather shy in most situations was anything but as she countered, "If you think that is wow, wait until Thursday." 

Cupid's cock grew instantly hard at the obvious innuendo as Beth let the words hang there as she got into the taxi and pulled away, leaving Cupid hard as a rock and begging for release. 

That night, each of them in their own rooms (Cupid a hotel), they got themselves off with almost identical fantasies...with two becoming one. 

..... 

Wednesday morning it occurred to Cupid it was critical that Beth know that he was the secret admirer. He ordered more flowers and this time signed the card. 

Beth had been to work twenty minutes when the two dozen red roses showed up on her desk. Her heart warmed as she stared at the lovely bouquet. Seeing the card she opened it feeling confident it was from Cupid. She had told him about her job and where she worked during their late night appetizers. 

She opened the card: 

Dear Beth, Yesterday was an amazing evening. I look forward to tomorrow and have a secret to let you in on. 

I am your secret admirer. 

With love, Cupid 

Beth's heart warmed at the thought that Cupid was indeed her secret admirer, although after a few minutes something popped into her head. How did he know where she worked on Monday? Or Tuesday? This alarmed her a bit as it was rather strange to get the flowers on Monday when they had only met twice, by accident, that day. Or was it an accident? She wanted to ask him, to find out, but realized they had never exchanged numbers. 

That night, Beth had a blast at the sex toy party going on a bit of a spending spree. She bought a pair of silk thigh high stockings for her date, something she had never done before, being more of a pantyhose girl. She bought a new vibrator that she used later that night, she bought a vibrating egg not for tomorrow but because she thought it would be fun and she bought three pair of thong panties something she used to wear in college while dating an old flame. She had also bought a gorgeous red dress after work for tomorrow that was both elegant and sexy, something that was way out of her usual comfort zone as it had a generous v-neck line and a side slit that would probably show her thigh high lace tops if anyone was paying attention. Yet, she was feeling sexy and wanted, and those two are a great mixture to open up a girl's conservative nature.  

===

Cupid got himself a tux for tomorrow and rented a limo as he prepared to woo her like she had never been wooed before. He also planned to tell her the truth of who he really was. 

That night, both of them went to bed with anticipation and anxiety of the day that lay ahead. For Beth she worried that Cupid was hiding a dark secret, no man was as perfect as he seemed to be; Cupid, meanwhile, had made a decision, he would tell her the truth and let her decide his fate. 

..... 

Both spent all day filled with excitement and trepidation at the hope that maybe this was the one...again. 

After work, Beth went home and got dressed for her hopeful romantic date. She dressed in the thong and thigh high stockings she had bought last night as well as the fire engine red dress she had purchased yesterday. Her hair was down, something she seldom did, and she actually wore a bit of eye liner and blush. She had just slipped on her three inch heels, something she hadn't worn since a wedding a couple of years ago, when there was a knock at the door. 

Cupid had on a tux and champagne cooling in the limo. Butterflies tickled inside as he waited to see the woman he felt he loved. Taking a deep breath, he knocked on the door. 

"Wow," Cupid said, speechless as he looked at Beth. 

"Wow, yourself," Beth smiled, feeling both the warmth of feeling the sincerity of the impact she had on Cupid and the instant tingle down below at seeing Cupid in a tux. He was utterly gorgeous. 

Cupid felt his cock rise just looking at Beth as he stammered, "You look radiant." 

Beth complimented back, "You clean up pretty nice yourself." 

"It's the tux," Cupid joked. 

"I disagree," Beth retorted. 

After a brief silence, Cupid said, "Well we should go. I have us reservations at Ardells." 

"You do not," Beth gasped, unable to believe Cupid could possibly get a reservation at the most prestigious restaurant in town, on Valentine's Day no less. 

"I do," Cupid said, smiling at how he got the reservation with one shot of his arrow, killing two birds with one stone. Offering his arm, "Shall we go, my lady?" 

"Why yes, my gentleman," Beth replied with an English accent. 

Cupid led her outside and Beth stammered, "Y-y-you got a limo?" 

"My Porsche is in the shop," Cupid joked. 

"Well that explains it," Beth laughed as they reached the limo. 

The driver opened the door for the couple and Beth slipped into the limo. Sitting down, she couldn't believe just how amazing the inside looked. There was light jazz playing on the stereo and champagne chilling. Cupid joined her and asked, "Can I offer you a drink?" 

"Yes, please," Beth replied, beginning to feel like a celebrity. 

Cupid poured two glasses and said, "A toast." 

"To what?" Beth asked, although she could think of a few things. 

"To new beginnings," Cupid said, the full meaning of his toast not yet revealed. 

"To new beginnings," Beth agreed wholeheartedly. 

Their glasses went clink and they drank their champagne their eyes locked on each other. 

The next two and a half hours were the best two and a half hours of both Beth's and Cupid's life. They drank, they chatted, they ate, chatted some more, both offering new tidbits of information about each other. The five course meal was the best Beth had ever had and the best in years for Cupid (travelling the world for centuries he had way too many favourite meals). 

Once desert was done and the bill paid, Cupid decided it was now or never. He asked, "Beth do you trust me?" 

"Of course," Beth answered, realizing she did completely. He was everything Jared wasn't. 

"I have something I have to tell you," Cupid continued. 

Beth let out the slightest of sighs. That one sentence bringing every insecurity in her to the forefront. That sentence was never good news. She tried to hide her worry, "Ok." 

Cupid saw the shift in Beth and trying to comfort her explained, "It is nothing bad, Beth. I am not married, or crazy, or anything, but what I have to tell you is a bit hard to believe." 

"What is it?" Beth desperate to know, feeling a mixture of curiosity and fear. 

"It is best if I show you?" Cupid said, standing up and taking her hand. 

Beth followed Cupid out the door and into the fresh air. He led her silently to a secluded spot and said, "Now don't be scared, but this is going to get weird." 

"How do I not get scared when you say that?" Beth asked, her mind spinning with anxiety over the vague explanation. 

Cupid took her hands and asked, "Have you ever been to the Eiffel Tower?" 

"What? No, why?" Beth asked. 

"That is where we are going," Cupid replied. 

"When?" Beth asked, trying to keep playing along with Cupid's strangeness. 

"Promise you won't freak out," Cupid asked. 

"Yes, I promise," Beth said, frustrated. 

Instantly, they were at the top of the Eiffel Tower. 

Beth's eyes went big as she was high up on what seemed to be the Eiffel Tower. "What, how?" 

"Relax, my love," Cupid said, holding her tight. 

The words 'my love' did relax Beth as she took a deep breath and looked around. She was definitely in Paris in the early morning. But how? "H-h-how did you do this?" 

"I'm Cupid," Cupid answered. 

"I know that," Beth began, before clarity hit her. "You...are...the...real...Cupid?" 

"Yes," Cupid nodded. 

"Wow?" Beth said, her head spinning at this revelation. 

"It gets stranger," Cupid said. 

"How is that possible?" Beth asked, unable to fathom the true reality of the moment. 

"I have been searching for the perfect woman for centuries," Cupid began. 

"Centuries?" Beth repeated as a question. 

Cupid nodded and explained, "And when we bumped into each other I felt something I had not felt in decades and as I got to know you better I knew you were the one." 

"Me?" Beth said, suddenly feeling like she was dreaming. 

"Yes you, Beth," Cupid smiled, "You are perfect." 

Beth's heart melted as tears began to stream down her cheeks. 

Cupid continued, "I love you, Beth." 

Beth knew as sure as she knew she was on the Eiffel Tower that she loved him too. "I love you too, Cupid." 

Their kiss was intimate and sweet, yet passionate and hungry and it lasted an eternity. Cupid never wanted this moment to end, but he couldn't keep back the secret that was still inside him. Breaking the kiss, he said, suddenly nervous, "There is one more thing." 

Beth could see Cupid's anxiety as he looked into her eyes. She asked warmly, "What is it?" 

"I-I-I am a virgin," Cupid admitted. 

"Really?" Beth asked, thinking that seemed impossible. "But you have lived for centuries." 

"Ay, there's the rub," Cupid smiled, quoting Hamlet. 

"I don't understand," Beth said. 

"I have kissed girls, but the rules of being Cupid are pretty clear. I must stay untainted. If I make love to a woman I become mortal," Cupid explained. 

Beth just stared at Cupid, before finally asking, "Y-y-you stop being Cupid?" 

"Yes," Cupid nodded. 

Suddenly Beth was conflicted. She knew without questioning it that she loved Cupid, yet she also didn't want to be the one that took Cupid away from his duty of spreading love throughout the world. "I don't know what to say," Beth finally said. 

Cupid smiled, "I have already made up my mind, Beth. I want to be with you." 

"But what about all the good you do?" Beth asked. 

"Well the way I see it, people will fall in love with or without me. There was no Cupid that brought you and I together," Cupid explained. Beth gave him a look, and Cupid defended, "I did not use my arrows on you Beth, I swear." 

"I believe you," she said, leaning in for a kiss. Breaking the kiss, Beth asked, her hand going to his crotch, "So how do we go about making you human?" 

Cupid blushed as all the blood shifted from one head to another. "W-w-we need to make love." 

"Hmmmmmm," Beth purred, her hand squeezing his hard cock as her mouth went to his ear. "No one seems to be here this early in the morning." 

Cupid stammered, "Well, it is five thirty in the morning here." 

"France is six hours ahead of New York?" Beth asked, still trying to come to grips with the weirdness of it all. 

"Yep," Cupid shrugged, before taking Beth's hands and asking, "Ready for our next rendezvous?" 

"I am ready for anything as long as it is with you," Beth replied. 

A second later they were in a luxury hotel room. 

"Where are we?" Beth asked. 

"Venice, I booked a room here and checked in last night Venice time," Cupid smiled. 

"A little presumptuous, don't you think?" Beth questioned playfully. 

"Better safe than sorry," Cupid replied, "I wanted tonight to be perfect." 

"Looks like it is morning," Beth replied, looking out their balcony and to the river, where people just seemed to be waking up for the day, another reminder of just how bizarre the whole thing was, it wasn't even midnight her time. 

Cupid came up behind her and said, "Venice is one of my favorite places." 

Beth turned around and into his arms, "Well it is quickly becoming my favorite place." 

The kiss began soft and tender, each exploring each other's mouths with their tongues. It started tentative and sweet, but as time passed the intensity increased. Five minutes became ten and ten became twenty before Beth finally broke the kiss. There was an undeniable hunger in her eyes as she lowered herself to her knees. She unfastened his belt, pulled down his pants and underwear, releasing Cupid's cock from its captive position. 

Cupid watched in awe as she opened her mouth and took his cock in-between her sweet lips. If Cupid thought she was beautiful before, it didn't compare to the sight of her slowly moving back and forth on his cock. 

"Oh yes," Cupid groaned, as the seemingly innocent Beth revealed another thing she was very good at. Cupid had had oral sex before, both giving and receiving (absurd but the definition of sex was clearly defined as penis into vagina and thus oral sex doesn't count), but like every other experience with Beth this was like the first time all over. 

Beth loved hearing the soft moans from Cupid and wanted to make him come with her mouth so the love making session would last longer. Although shy in public, in the bedroom Beth came to life. She enjoyed giving head, she liked taking risks and just letting go. 

Cupid knew he wouldn't last long, not having received oral sex since the 1950s. He warned after only a couple of minutes of Beth's lips wrapped around his cock, "Damn, Beth, I am going to come soon." 

Beth didn't slow down, she sped up, hungry to taste the God of Love's cum. She was not disappointed as a few seconds later Cupid's sweet cum coated her throat. 

Cupid couldn't believe how great his orgasm felt as Beth took all his cum. 

After receiving every last drop, Beth allowed Cupid's cock to slip out of her mouth. Getting off her knees, Beth moved back up and pushed Cupid onto the bed. She pulled off his shoes, yanked off his pants and socks and crawled onto him. 

This time it was Cupid's turn to take control. He flipped Beth onto her back and kissed her passionately. It was now his turn to be hungry. He had pleasured many women with his tongue over the centuries and had mastered the skill including the elusive g-spot mystery. He pulled her up and Beth quickly discarded her dress, now only in bra, thong, stockings and heels. "Hmmmm, stockings, I love stockings." 

Beth smiled, flipping her heels off and rubbing her stocking-clad feet around Cupid pulling him back down onto her. "I will wear them every day for you, Cupid." 

"Delicious," Cupid replied, again slowly moving down Beth's beautiful body. Reaching her breasts, he buried his face between her small, but firm breasts. 

Beth chuckled, "Would you like better access?" 

"That would be very nice," Cupid replied, and watched amazed as Beth quickly took off her bra like it was a magic trick. 

As soon as Beth's fully erect nipples were free, Cupid took each one in his mouth, going back and forth between the two. Beth moaned, her nipples being excessively sensitive and a direct trigger to her pussy. "Oh, that feels so nice, Cupid." 

Cupid continued the lavish attention on her breasts for another minute or two, before he slowly moved to her thong covered pussy, a wetness already displaying her excitement. He put his lips on her pussy through the thin fabric and breathed hard onto her pussy. 

"Ohhhhhhhhhh, Cuuuuupid," Beth whimpered, the direct contact creating a burning desire instantly. 

Cupid put his hands on her lips and Beth naturally lifted up her ass. Cupid slid the thong down Beth's stocking-clad legs and once off, instead of returning to Beth's pussy, he took her feet into his hand's and kissed her silk-clad toes. 

Beth had never had a man pleasure her feet so intimately and it only enhanced the burning fire inside her. 

Cupid sucked each toe into his mouth before slowly moving down her leg and back to Beth's wet glistening pussy, her swollen clit begging for attention. 

Beth begged, suddenly desperate to feel Cupid in her, "I need you in me now." 

Cupid instead buried his face in her pussy and began licking slowly, parting Beth's lips with his tongue. 

"Oh, yeeees," Beth moaned. 

Cupid continued the slow simmering for a couple of minutes before swirling his tongue around Beth's clit and then flicking her clit with his tongue. 

"Oooooooooh please, stop teasing me, baby," Beth whimpered, his tongue driving her wild. 

Cupid sensing she was close, he slipped his finger inside her and quickly found her g-spot. As he put pressure on Beth's clit with his mouth and began to shake his head left and right, he tapped on her g-spot like a drum. 

"Oh God, oh God, shiiiiiiiiiiit," Beth screamed, Cupid bringing new pleasure she never knew existed. The orgasm was the most intense she had ever felt as her legs stiffened and her body quaked and quaked, a solid 9.9 on the Richter scale. 

Cupid lapped the sweet champagne from the most beautiful girl in the world and it tasted better than water after being lost in the desert for years. 

Beth pulled Cupid's head deeper into her as the never ending orgasm continued to riddle her body. Finally, she let go of Cupid's head and Cupid slid his finger out of Beth's leaking pussy. 

Cupid looked at Beth's red cheeks, his cock hard and ready to end his time as the God of Love by finding love himself. 

Beth opened her eyes and looked into Cupid's. She could see through him and she said, "You were there when I got the flowers, weren't you? When I found the candy?" 

"Yes," Cupid replied, you looked like at me each time. 

"I could sense someone there. I thought I was going crazy," Beth smiled. 

"I'm crazy for you," Cupid playfully replied. 

"This whole thing is crazy," Beth said, pulling him to her. 

"Let's be crazy together," Cupid suggested. 

"Are you ready?" Beth asked. 

"I have never been more ready than I am at this moment," Cupid answered. 

"Make love to me, Cupid," Beth said, opening her stocking-clad legs. 

Cupid positioned himself between Beth's legs and moved his cock to her pussy. 

"I love you Beth," Cupid said, looking into Beth's eyes and seeing forever in them. 

"I love you too, Cupid," Beth returned, seeing the man behind the God. 

Cupid looked up, saying goodbye to the Gods, before he leaned forward and began his life as a man. 

THE END!!! Report_Story
