title: The Gambler

#1 

===

Shit! Susan tore up the pari-mutual tickets and tossed them on the ground. She had been so sure that Indian Fog was going to win that she had bet her last $200 on the horse. Dead last for Christ's sake! The goddamn glue bag had come in dead last. At 7 to 1 she would have been sitting pretty, but now she was in deep trouble. The money she'd just lost was the week's grocery money. The cupboards were bare when her husband had gone for a snack and he had given her $300 to stock the shelves. When he got home tonight he was going to expect to see something and there was no way she was going to be able to explain that she'd lost the money at the track. 

"What the hell am I going to do?" she asked herself. 

She had borrowed money from everyone she knew to support her gambling habit and now even her own mother was refusing to help her. To make things even worse she owed her bookie $1800 and for three weeks now she had been promising him that she would pay up; he was beginning to lose his patience and was starting to make threatening noises. 

A sudden sharp cry brought her attention back to the present; she looked down and saw that little Andy had spit out his pacifier. Sweet Jesus, she had forgotten that she had him with her. She put his pacifier back in his mouth, rearranged his blankets, and started pushing his stroller toward the exit. She heard a 'wolf whistle' and turned her head to see two young men watching her with apparent interest. 

"Asshole" she thought, "I'm a young mother pushing her baby in a stroller, not a goddamn hooker looking to get laid." 

Susan continued on toward the exit and as she pushed little Andy in his stroller she allowed her mind to dwell on her predicament. She had to get some food in the house by the time Brian got home, but how in the world was she going to do it? A voice broke her train of thought, "Hey Momma, looking good!" 

She looked to her left and saw a young black man at the public phone. He smiled at her and gave her a little wave. God, she thought, what is with these guys? It must be something to do with her being a young mother with a baby in tow; God knows I don't get this much attention when I'm out without the baby. 

Susan was almost to the exit when the thought hit her with the force of a sledgehammer blow. No, she said to herself, I couldn't do that! But an inner voice said, "it would solve your problem." Then several voices in her head started to argue, "It would only be this once", "But I'm not that kind of girl", "If you don't, what will you tell Brian tonight?" "But I've never done anything like that before. What about little Andy?" "Little Andy is too young to know what is going on", "But I might get caught", "Brian won't be home before six-thirty, and if you don't do it, where will the food come from?" 

Susan bit her lower lip and then, making up her mind, she swung the stroller around and headed back the way she came. The young black man was still by the phone and she pushed the stroller up to him; taking a deep breath she said, "Do you really think I'm looking good?" 

The young man was caught off guard by the question, but he quickly recovered and with the bravado of youth he replied, "Good enough to eat, and then some." 

Susan took another deep breath and plunged on, "Good enough that you would pay $100 for some of it?" 

The young man gave her a big smile and said, "In a heart beat lady, in a heart beat!" 

Susan told him to wait for her over by the exit and she went looking for the two who had whistled at her. When she found them she followed the same scenario that she had used on the black man. It was easier the second time and after a few minutes talking they had each agreed to pay her for her favors. When she approached the exit with the two men in tow she found that the young black man was waiting for her with another black man, "I told Gene her about you", he said, "And he thinks maybe he'd like some of what you got." 

Susan looked at the four men and then said, "It's like this guys, I need money for food and diapers. I've never done anything like this before, but I'm desperate. I'm so desperate that if you know someone else who would be interested in a fresh young housewife, give them a call and I'll take them on too," and she gave them directions to her house. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The two black men, Gene and Andy, did not have a car so they rode with Susan. On the trip to her place Paul asked her just how many men she thought she could take on at one time. Susan thought for a moment before saying that having never done this before she had no idea. Andy said he knew a lot of guys who would like a shot at a girl like her, "But your price might have to come down a bit. After five or six guys you're going to be pretty loose and sloppy and some guys won't want to pay full price for that." 

Susan got an image in her mind of eight or ten guys standing around her bed looking down at her and it caused her to blush. What is wrong with me she thought this is only a one-time thing - it's never going to happen again - so why am I thinking of eight or ten guys? "Because" said a small voice from the back of her mind, "You still have to pay off your bookie." 

She pulled up in front of her place and for several moments she sat staring straight with her hands on the wheel. It's not too late to back out she thought, all I have to do is tell these guys I've changed my mind and give them a ride back to the track. No, she thought, I've got to have groceries in the house when Brian comes home and this is the only way. She turned and looked at the two guys, "Come on, let's do it." 

As they were going up the front steps a car pulled up behind Susan's and the other two guys from the track got out. Once inside Susan turned to them, "We've got to get this done before my husband gets home so while I put the baby down for his nap you guys figure out who gets to be first." 

She put little Andy down for his nap and then went into her bedroom and took of her clothes. As she looked at herself in the full length mirror she wondered how she could be so calm and matter of fact about what she was about to do. She had never been with any man other than her husband before, and here she was getting ready for a gangbang. Oh well, if I'm going to be a whore I can at least try to give them their moneys worth. She went to her bureau and got out a pair of nylons and a garter belt and then went to the closet for a pair of high heels. After putting the stuff on, she took one last look at herself in the mirror; not bad she thought, they should like it. Taking a deep breath she said to herself, "Show time" and she turned and headed for the living room. 

Instead of four guys there were six - all naked and stroking their cocks. Gene said, "I took you at your word and called these guys. There are two more who are going to try and make it, but they were not sure they can get away." 

Susan looked at them for a moment, took a deep breath and said, "Okay, who's first?" 

Gene stood up and Susan took him by the hand and led him into her bedroom. Susan laid down and spread her legs expecting Gene to just climb between them, but as soon as he was undressed he climbed up on the bed and moved into a sixty-nine position with her. As his cock bobbed just inches away from her mouth she almost panicked; she hadn't planned on anything more than a quick fuck for each of the men, but a glance at the bedside clock showed her that she did not have a lot of time to waste - she had six guys to do and then had to get to the store before Brian got home - she had no time to argue. Gene must have read her mind, "Just a couple of licks or a quick suck to get me rock hard, okay?" 

Susan opened her mouth and took him in; she wasn't really into oral sex and she rarely sucked Brian's cock so she wasn't all that good at giving head. Gene stroked into her mouth a couple of times and then he moved down between her legs and wasted no time in pushing himself into her opening. A couple of hard pushes and he was all the way in and fucking her hard. Susan started to push her box back up at him. She had not figured that she would enjoy what she was doing, but she thought the more active she was the sooner she could get him off and move on to the next guy. 

Gene started to fuck her harder and she was suddenly surprised to find that she was responding to his thrusts. She had expected that she was going to have to fake an orgasm, but her body was starting to tingle and it looked as if she was going to have a real one. Gene grunted in her ear, "Here it comes baby, here it comes" and he shot himself deep inside her. Susan wanted to cry out, "No, please no. Wait for me" but it was too late. 

Gene got off her and went back to the living room leaving her lying on the bed, legs spread wide, cum leaking out of her pussy and her fingers working furiously to get herself off. Mike was the next one into the room and when he saw her finger fucking herself he called back to the other guys, "Hey, we have got a real hottie in here." 

As Mike thrust into her Susan arched up to meet him, grabbed his ass cheeks and pulled him as deep into her as he could go. She was pushing up to meet his every thrust and she was making noises that she finally recognized as her voice crying, "Make me cum, make me cum, please make me cum." 

The words seemed to drive Mike into overdrive and he started to fuck her harder and faster and Susan's body shook as her orgasm washed over her. Mike kept fucking her hard and Susan felt her loins begin to tingle again and Susan was amazed - she'd never before had more than one orgasm during a love making session, but there was no denying that another one was building. Her head was grabbed and turned to the side and a hard cock was pushed between her lips. 

Susan lost all track of time as the six men fucked her repeatedly. She had swallowed cum for the first time in her life - three times that she could remember - and she was surprised to find that it tasted different from man to man. She couldn't remember how many times each guy had fucked her, nor could she remember who the guys were who had cum in her mouth. Her body had taken over and had delivered orgasm after orgasm and that had turned her into a mindless piece of meat. She probably would have lain there and let them fuck her all night had not Paul put a stop to things, "Hey guys, we have to stop and get out of here before her husband gets home." 

"Fuck that," said another voice, "We'll let him take a turn." 

Then Gene spoke up, "Hey man - I don't want to fuck up and risk not getting another chance at this one. She's just too damn hot a slut. Let's get her cleaned up." 

Susan felt herself being lifted up and carried and suddenly water was hitting her skin. She came out of her sexual trance to find herself in the shower and as confusion slowly drained away came the realization that she had several things to do, and quickly, before Brian got home. 

Susan came into the living room to find everyone except Andy gone. Andy had little Andy over his shoulder and was burping him, "He started crying and you were, how should I put this, you were busy so I fixed him a bottle and started feeding him." 

Susan looked around the room and saw no evidence of anyone having been there. Paul noticed her looking around and he said, "Mike and Gene cleaned things up for you. Your money is over there on the table." Susan walked over and counted it, there was over $900 dollars. Andy saw the look of confusion on her face, "Four more guys showed up after you got started. You know, if you plan on doing this on a regular basis you are going to have to learn how to control yourself. If the guys hadn't of wanted to be able to come back for some more of you they could have left you lying senseless on the bed and taken off without paying you a dime. In fact, two of them tried to do just that, but Mike and Gene put a stop to it." 

Susan looked at him; "I don't know what came over me. I've not been with another man since I got married, let alone with several. I thought I was just going to lay there and pretend to like it, let you all fuck me once and then get the place cleaned up before my husband got home." 

Andy smiled at her and said, "Well, you need to work on it before the next time. Here, take your kid, I've got to get going." 

He handed her little Andy and headed for the door, but then he stopped and came back. Taking a piece of paper out of his pocket he handed it to her, "It's my phone number. If you want to do this again give me a call and I'll set it up for you" and then he left. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Susan looked at the wall clock - she had just enough time to get to the Piggly- Wiggly and still get home before Brian. Christ, I hope he doesn't want sex tonight; he'd be sure to notice how loose I am. As she put Andy in his crib she thought about how fortunate she had been. She had more than enough money to buy groceries and still have enough to take to the track the next day. There were three horses running that she knew were winners. If the odds were right she would win more than enough to pay off her bookie and still have lots left over. She headed for the kitchen to get her grocery list.  

===

Three horses that couldn't lose! Three sure bets. Shit! She tore up her tickets and threw them on the ground. All the money she had made yesterday was gone and she didn't have a damn thing to show for it. And there was still the seventh race to go and Blackie's Tyree was going off at 12 to 1 and Susan was certain that he couldn't lose. Sure, she'd had a run of bad luck, but it was going to turn - she could feel it. She needed to find some money quick; she only had about fifteen minutes to get her bet down on Blackie. She looked around and in less than ten seconds she found what she was looking for; a man of about forty who was staring at her with a look on his face that was saying, "Boy, I sure would like some of that." 

"Come on Little Andy, Mommy's got to do it again," she said to the eighteen month old baby in the stroller as she started to push it in the direction of the man. 

Susan smiled to herself; two days ago and she would have been horrified to even think about what she was about to do. Yesterday had changed all that; Oh God had things changed! Desperation had made her into a whore yesterday, and it looked like it was going to do it to her again today. When she reached the man she said, "Like what you see?" 

The man seemed a bit taken aback by her bold approach, but he recovered quickly, "As a matter of fact I do," he replied. 

"Enough to part with fifty bucks for a blow job?" Susan asked. 

The man gave her a grin and said, "I'd rather fuck you." 

Susan said, "Maybe later, but right now I only have enough time for a blow job. I need to come up with fifty before the seventh race. Yes or no? If not I've got to hurry and find somebody else." 

The man said okay and asked where? Susan looked around, then told the man to follow her, and started pushing little Andy's stroller toward a line of Porta- Johns that were next to one of the race track's walls. She moved into the space between the line of toilets and the wall and looked around to make sure she would be able to do the man and remain unseen. She held out her hand for the money and the man pulled a roll of bills out of his pocket and peeled off five ten dollar bills and placed them on her palm. Susan put the money in her purse and dropped to her knees in front of the man who already had his cock out. 

Susan still wasn't all that keen on performing oral sex, but she had done well enough yesterday and she owed this man a blowjob for his money and she would do her best. She opened her mouth and circled her lips around the head of his prick, her right hand came up to cup his balls and her left wrapped around the base of his cock and she started to suck him off. The man's hands moved to the back of her head and he held her as he began to plunge his cock back and forth in her mouth. 

Little Andy started to fidget and to keep him from starting to cry she dropped her hand from the man's balls and used it to rock Andy's stroller. Susan stopped trying to suck the man's cock and instead clamped her lips tight around him and let him fuck her face. It took only minutes before the man said, "I'm cumming baby, I'm gonna cum in your hot little mouth" and no sooner than he had said it, he did it. Susan choked as the spurts of cum hit the back of her throat and she did her best to swallow it all. The man kept his cock in her mouth until he stopped spurting and started to go limp. Susan, determined to give good value in case she ever needed this man again, licked the man's cock clean. As the man put his cock away he said, "I still want to fuck that tight little body of yours." 

Wiping her mouth clean with a hankie Susan said, "Maybe later. If my horse doesn't win in the seventh I may have to earn some gas money to get home." 

"Who you betting?" asked the man. Susan told him and the man said, "Don't waste your money honey. Bet on Sammy's Child. He's a lock!" 

Susan stood at the rail and watched in disgust as Sammy's Child flew across the finish line five lengths ahead of Blackie's Tyree. As she threw her tickets on the ground the man, who had been standing next to her said, "Do I get to fuck you now?" 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Susan was disgusted with herself. She had been so upset at losing at the track that she hadn't even discussed price with the man, his name was Dan, who had followed her home and then into her bed. They had fucked for over an hour until she told him that they had to stop because her husband would be home soon. It was only after Dan had gone that she'd remembered that she had forgotten to ask for the money. Shit! she said as she changed the bed sheets for the second time in two days, but on her way to the bathroom she saw green on top of the dresser and when she looked she found two one hundred dollar bills. Not bad, she thought, I'm moving up in the world. Yesterday it was a hundred and today I'm up to two hundred. As she took her shower she was already figuring out where the money would go; five on her favorite number, ten toward lottery tickets and the rest to the track - there were some very good horses running tomorrow. 

Susan was changing little Andy's diaper when the front door bell rang. Picking up the baby she went to the front door and pulled it open to find Eddie, her bookie, standing there with two other men and a woman. Eddie smiled, "Susan! I was afraid I might not catch you at home. Can we come in?" 

Numbly, Susan stepped aside and let the four of them enter and then she said, "Eddie, you promised me that you would never come to the house." 

"I know, I know" Eddie replied, "But you promised me that you would always pay your losses off on time and I figure your broken promise to me cancels out my promise to you." 

"That's not fair!" Susan cried, "I've always paid you." 

Eddie waggled a finger at her, "You have been promising me for over a month now and I haven't seen a dime. Yet my sources tell me you have dropped at least six bills at the track over the last two days and that was money that you could have given me to pay down your debt. At the very least you could have had the courtesy to place those bets with me instead of giving your money to the track. It wouldn't have drawn down your debt to me, but at least I could have made a buck or two off of it and you would have kept my good will." 

Little Andy started whimpering and Susan said, "I've got to take care of the baby and then I have an appointment at noon so tell me what this is about and then go." 

Eddie's smile went away, "What this is all about is that I have sold your IOU's to Mr. Diamano" and he pointed at the larger of the two men who were with him, "And he is here to discuss with you the method of repayment." 

He turned and headed for the door and partway there he stopped and turned back toward her, "Oh, by the way, don't call me to place any bets anymore. You belong to Mr. Diamano now" and he turned and left. 

Diamano said, "Let's get down to business. With transfer fees, penalties and interest, you owe me twenty-two hundred. You got it?" 

Susan was stunned, "But I only owed Eddie seventeen!" 

"Like I said, penalties, interest and fees" Diamano replied. "Do you have the money?" 

Little Andy was crying now and Susan got up and started to walk to the kitchen. Diamano said, "Henry!" and the other man moved in front of her and stopped her. 

"Gloria, take the baby." And the woman reached for Andy. 

Susan tried to step back but Henry put both of his hands on her shoulders and held her in place and then he squeezed. Susan cried out in pain and gave up the baby when the woman again reached for him. 

"Sit down!" said Diamano, "One last time, do you have the money?" 

Susan looked down at her hands and weakly mumbled "No." Diamano looked at her for a moment before saying, "That's too bad." He looked at Henry, "Take her into the bedroom and strip her." 

Susan lay on the bed staring at Diamano and Henry as they took off their clothes. She had struggled and had tried to fight Henry, but he had just picked her up like a doll and carried her into the bedroom. He had thrown her on the bed and told her to get undressed and when she hadn't moved he had ripped her clothes off of her. She had deep welts on her shoulders where her bra straps had dug into her flesh before breaking. Diamano approached the bed and said, "This is your first installment. We will call it a collection fee and if you prove to be adequate we will adjust your debt to reduce some of the principal. Do you understand?" 

Susan meekly nodded yes and Diamano had pushed between her legs, lined up his cock and pushed forward. It took him four strokes to work his cock all the way in and then he started to fuck her with slow strokes. Susan, in an attempt to be 'adequate' moved her legs and locked them behind his. She started pushing up to meet his strokes and Diamano started to move a little faster and push into her a little harder. Susan felt the little 'tingle' in her loins that signaled the start of an orgasm building and she started to moan and the moan turned into a string of 'oh oh oh's which in turn became "oh yes, oh yes, oh yes." 

Susan was no longer trying to pretend to be adequate, she wanted this orgasm and she began to fuck back as hard as she could. Diamano was fucking her fast and furious now and she was meeting every thrust with an intensity that astonished her. She wanted to make this brute cum, to drain his balls, to show him that she was the best piece of ass he'd ever had. Her heels were drumming on the backs of his legs, her fingernails were dug into the cheeks of his ass and she was crying, "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me" in his ear. His hands went under her and he pulled her to him and she felt the warmth that told her that he had cum inside her. Diamano kept stroking into her, but she could feel his size diminish and she cried, "Don't stop, don't stop damn you! I'm almost there, I'm almost there!" 

Diamano rolled off her and said, "Give her what she wants Henry, finish her off." 

Henry moved between her legs and sank his hard cock into her wet, juicy cunt and he started fucking her hard and fast. It took twenty strokes of Henry's cock to send Susan over the edge and she fell back on the bed drained of energy, but Henry was just getting started. Susan lay there, breathing deeply, as Henry ploughed her pussy and in only minutes she felt the 'tingle' again. Both men fucked her three times that morning. It was during Diamano's third time that Gloria came into the room. Diamano was fucking her and she was sucking Henry's cock when Gloria came in and said, "The baby's hungry." 

Susan took her mouth off Henry's cock long enough to say, "The formula is in the fridge. Use the blue bottles, not the red ones" and she went back to working on Henry's dick. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

As Susan changed the bed sheets for the third time in as many days, she thought about what Diamano had said as he was leaving, "I'll be back tomorrow at nine in the morning. Either have the money or a plan on how you intend to pay off the debt within the next two weeks." 

As Susan fluffed the pillows she wondered where in the hell she could come up with two grand on short notice and then her train of thought was interrupted as little Andy began to cry.  

===

Susan was feeding little Andy strained carrots when the door bell rang. She looked at the clock, nine already, Diamano was certainly punctual. She wiped the overflow off of little Andy's face and then got up to answer the door. She opened the door to find Diamano, Henry and Gloria waiting and she held the door open for them. Once inside Susan closed the door behind them and followed them into the living room and said, "I'm feeding the baby. It should only take a few more minutes." 

Diamano said, "Gloria." And Gloria said "I'll take over honey" and she headed for the kitchen. 

Diamano pointed to the couch and Susan dutifully sat down. Diamano got right to the point, "How do you plan on taking care of your debt to me?" 

Susan had expected the question, but she wasn't used to Diamano's direct manner; she had an answer for him, of sorts, but hesitated to give it because she didn't think it would satisfy him. She thought back to the previous day, Diamano and his crew (as she'd come to think of them) had no sooner gone than the phone rang. It was Tony, one of the guys from her first day as a paid whore, and he wanted to know if he and a couple of friends could come over. She had glanced at the clock and seen that she had plenty of time before her husband got home from work and she had said yes. Their visit had been brief, but profitable; she had sucked the cocks of the four men and then had fucked them, and had collected $600 for her time. After they had gone she had remembered what Andy, the young black man had said about helping her if she decided to sell her body on a steady basis. She had looked up his number and called him and asked him if he was still willing to help her. She had explained her situation and her need to make two grand and he'd told her that he would see what he could do, "You know what this makes me, don't you?" 

When she had said no, Andy had laughed and said, "It means that I'm your business agent, your pimp, and that I'm working on commission. Don't worry, I'll be gentle" and he'd hung up. He'd called back an hour later, "I got you something. It will get you a grand, but I don't know if you are going to want to do it." 

"What do you mean?" Susan had asked. 

Andy said, "It's a stag party and there could be as many as twelve dudes there. Do you think you are up to it?" 

Susan had taken several moments to think about it saying, "I have no choice, I have to do it." 

Andy had said he'd set it up and get back to her. 

"Well?" Diamano's voice broke into her train of thought. 

Susan looked up from her hands and said, "I can give you $200 now and I'll have a grand to give you by the end of the week. That will leave $800 and I'll get that to you by the end of the following week." 

"Wrong!" Diamano said, "The interest on your debt is twenty percent per week. That means another $360 gets added on this Friday. If you pay the grand before Friday it will still be twenty percent on the remaining balance, which brings your debt to $960. Henry and I are both going to fuck you again today, primarily as an object lesson to show you what you have to look forward to if you don't pay according to the schedule that you just set for yourself. If you don't meet that schedule you are going to spend a lot of time on your back with your clothes off. Do you understand me?" 

Susan nodded her head yes and Diamano said, "Good! Today's session will knock off another $200 so you are only looking at $1600 which should pose no problem for you if you follow your schedule." He got up; "Shall we move to the bedroom?" 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

As Susan changed the sheets yet again she wondered if she should buy several more sets. If today was any indication she probably should. Both Henry and Diamano were in fine form and they had fucked her for over an hour. Both of them had fucked her twice and as much as she hated to admit it, even to herself, she had loved every bit of it and had even hoped that they could have gone a third time. 

When this play for pay thing of hers had started it was because of desperation, but the more she screwed, the more she came to like it, and if she ever got her ass out of debt she didn't think she could ever go back to being a one man woman. What that would do to her marriage she could not imagine any more than she could imagine what would happen if Brian ever found out about her gambling. There was no way she could ever let her husband find out about her gambling. Brian's straight-laced upbringing would have him looking at her as a handmaiden of the devil. He would accept her as a whore easier than he would accept her as a gambler, or so she believed. She could be wrong, but could she chance finding out? No, she didn't think so. 

She also wondered about the curious conversation she had had with the woman Gloria as Diamano and his crew were leaving. Gloria had hung back a little and as soon as Diamano and Henry were out of earshot she'd said, "Make sure you meet that schedule honey. They don't want you to and they are hoping that you don't. They have plans for you and you're not going to like them" and then she'd hurried of to catch up with Diamano. 

They had plans for her? What possibly could that mean?  

===

Susan was soaking in the tub when the call from Andy came, "You going to be home for a while?" 

Susan said she would be and Andy said he would be right over. As Susan put down the cordless phone she wondered if she should bother getting dressed. Probably not. Lately, she thought, every guy who walks through the front door fucks me. After she had dried off and put on her makeup she went to the closet and selected her frumpiest looking robe; no sense putting on something sexy and asking for it, she thought, and then went into the kitchen to make a pot of coffee. The doorbell rang (the sound of doom she was beginning to think) and Susan answered it to find Andy and another black man standing on the porch. She stepped aside to let them in and then had them follow her into the kitchen where she offered them both coffee which they accepted. 

"Honey," Andy said, "This is Jerome and Jerome is the man who put together the stag party and he wanted to meet you before he agreed to give you the gig. But before we go any farther I want to be sure that you know what you are getting yourself into. The party is a bachelor's party for Jerome's brother and there are seven invited guests plus Jerome and his brother. Yours will be the only white face in the crowd. And," he went on, "There is also the possibility that the word might go out that there is a good looking white broad taking on all comers and there could be some party crashers. Jerome and I will try and control things, but I can't promise you anything except we won't let you be physically abused. Knowing this, do you still want to do it?" 

Susan was silent for several moments and then she said, "I really don't have any choice. I have to pay my bookie off by Friday or I'm in deep trouble." 

Jerome spoke for the first time, "Andy has already told me that you're a great piece of ass, and I can see for myself that you are gorgeous, but I want to find out how good you are myself." 

Susan looked him right in the eye and then she stood up and slowly let her robe slip from her shoulders to the floor. Jerome looked at her and said, "Not bad, not bad at all, but that's not what I want to check out. He unzipped his pants and took out his rapidly hardening cock. Susan's eyes never left his as she sank to her knees in front of him and licked the head of his cock. She licked it twice more like she would lick a lollipop and then she lowered her head and took him in her mouth. For two minutes she sucked on the hard shaft while massaging Jerome's balls and then she stood up and headed for the bedroom. Half way there she stopped and turned around, "Well, are you coming or not?" Andy and Jerome both got up and followed her.

Susan was surprised. She had expected Brian to throw a fit when she told him that she was going to a Mary Kay party given by one of her girl friends and that he shouldn't wait up for her. Brian did not usually like to be left alone with little Andy, but he had simply said, "Fine. Have a nice time and don't worry about us guys, we'll be all right, won't we Champ?" as he took little Andy from her. A feeling of love and tenderness came over Susan at those words and she hated herself for deceiving Brian. She wished she could tell him about her gambling debts, but she knew he wouldn't understand and it would only create more problems. She bent and kissed him and then she left. 

It was just as Andy said it would be; the room was a sea of black faces and she felt an unaccountable tingle as she realized that she was really looking forward to the night's experience. She had planned to do a slow strip tease to warm things up, but she soon found out that as far as the men were concerned things were already hot enough. Two guys came up to her and walked her to the couch and proceeded to undress her. They sat her down on the couch and then one sat down on either side of her and they began to play with her tits. A third man pushed her legs apart and then knelt between them; she felt fingers being pushed into her pussy and as the man began to finger-fuck her she looked around the room and saw all the men shedding their clothes. A fourth man appeared in front of her, his stiff cock swaying back and forth in front of her face and the man's hands went to the back of her head and he pulled her mouth onto him. 

Susan was being turned on quicker than she thought possible. She started hunching her pussy at the hand that was finger fucking her and the guys working on her tits stopped what they were doing and pulled her down on the floor. She was put on her hands and knees and the man who had been fingering her pussy moved behind her and she felt his cock probing for her opening. The large knob finally found what it was looking for and she felt it being pushed into her. The man whose cock had been in her mouth had followed her to the floor and her head was now bobbing up and down on him. She felt hands playing with her tits and someone grabbed her right hand and put it on his cock and she began to awkwardly stroke it. The man whose cock she was sucking suddenly grabbed the back of her head and held it still and she felt the first spurt of his cum hit the back of her throat. She struggled to swallow his outpouring without choking and finally he released her head and pulled his dick out of her mouth. He rolled away from her and another man took his place, and as her mouth closed around him the man fucking her started to pound hard into her; he grabbed her hips and pushed into her as deep as he could go and Susan felt the wet heat that told her she had just taken his load. He pulled out of her and some one else immediately took his place and rammed his cock into her. 

Susan lost track of time as cock after cock emptied itself in her mouth and pussy. She had orgasm after orgasm until she was weak from exhaustion, and then, suddenly, it was over. Everyone was gone except for Andy and Jerome. They helped her to her feet and Susan saw a look of awe on Jerome's face. 

"Jesus," he said, "You were awesome. I've never seen anything like it. I just wish I'd had a video camera so I could have taped it. If I can set it up will you do it again?" 

Susan smiled and said, "As long as the price is right just give me a call." 

Andy helped her into the bathroom and helped her clean up. He had taken charge of her clothes as she had been stripped and so they were still clean and presentable. Looking at herself in the mirror as she applied her makeup she thought, "At least you don't look like you've just been gangbanged," but she knew that she didn't dare let Brian fuck her tonight. She was so loose and sloppy down there that he wouldn't even be able to touch the sides. Andy walked her to her car and just before she got in the car he handed her an envelope, "Here's your fee baby. I'll stop by in a day or two and collect my commission." 

She looked at him and said, "You never did tell me what your commission was." 

Andy smiled at her and said, "I'm going to take it in trade." 

Susan dropped the envelope in her purse and turned to him. She leaned forward and kissed him, "Any time lover. Just call and I'm yours."

Susan pulled into the slot in the supermarket parking lot. She got out, took the stroller out of the car and then helped little Andy out of his car seat. She was putting Andy in the stroller when a white van pulled up next to her. The side door slid open and Henry stepped out. He motioned for her to get in the van and she bent over to take Andy out of the stroller, but Henry said, "Leave the kid. Gloria will take care of it." 

Susan climbed in the van and found Diamano sitting on a couch and before she was even fully inside the van his hand shot out toward her, "The money!" 

Susan looked at the outstretched hand and felt sick inside. "I don't have it," she said. She thought back to yesterday, so full of promise at the start, so disastrous at the end. Susan had gotten out of bed feeling curiously refreshed and she knew it was going to be a great day. While having her first cup of morning coffee she had read her horoscope in the morning paper - "Your investments will bear fruit so press your advantage. Beware of confrontational personal matters." 

By ten in the morning she knew what she had to do. She packed up little Andy and had gone out to the racetrack. She had won $200 on the first race, $165 on the second and $210 on the third. Knowing that her luck had finally changed she had plunged heavily on the next three races and when it was time for the seventh to run she was broke. She had gotten up this morning and gathered together all of her jewelry and she was going to pawn it as soon as she left the grocery store. 

"I'll have some of it a little later today, I promise," she'd said, but Diamano just looked past her, "Gloria - bring her car and follow us." 

Susan paled, "Where are you taking me?" as Henry climbed in the van and pulled the door closed. 

"To a place where you will settle your debt to me." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Half an hour later the van pulled up outside a warehouse on the outskirts of town and Henry helped Susan out of the van and then took her by the arm and led her inside. The inside of the warehouse had cables running all over the floor and a lot of what looked like spotlights. There were several pieces of furniture lying about in a haphazard manner and there were ten or twelve people running around and moving things. Diamano hollered, "Sylvia" and a harried looking middle-aged woman hurried up to him. He pointed at Susan and said, "Here's the talent. Get her ready for scene one." 

The woman looked at Susan and said, "Follow me dear" and started walking away. Susan did not follow. "What is this?" she asked, "What's going on here?" 

Diamano gave her a menacing look and said, "You just do what you are told and you and your kid will leave here unhurt and debt free. You give me any trouble and you just may not leave here unhurt." 

Angrily Susan said, "I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on here!" 

Diamano looked at her for a moment and then he said, "You, my dear, are going to star in a porno movie. In scene one your husbands boss will stop by the house with some papers for your husband to sign and finding you home alone he will seduce you. In scene two you will be fucking the two men who have just delivered your new bedroom set. In scene three your next door neighbor will come over for coffee and you will eat her pussy while she eats yours and in scene four you will be fucking your neighbors husband when yours comes home and catches you. He will decide to join in - The End. Roll credits." 

Susan was aghast! "I will do no such thing! I am not a slut who will just spread her legs because someone like you says, "Do it!" 

Diamano laughed, "Honey, you have been selling it for the past week now and that makes you either a slut, a whore, a prostitute or a hooker - you pick whatever name for it you like. Oh, don't you give that hurt, shocked look. Did you think I wouldn't keep an eye on you? You will do it all right, one way or another. I'll scrap the first version and we can do a rape movie instead. Or better yet" and he hollered for Gloria, "Come here and bring the kid." 

In a few moments Gloria appeared with little Andy. "Gloria here has a bad case of dropitus. If she forgets to take her medicine she gets real clumsy and careless. Have you taken your medicine yet today Gloria?" 

Gloria shook her head 'no'. Diamano looked at Susan and said, "Let's hope she doesn't drop your kid head first onto this hard concrete floor. Could be bad for him, know what I mean?" 

Susan doubted that Diamano would let that happen, but she couldn't be sure and so she resigned herself to the fact she was about to become a porn star. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Susan hadn't realized that making a movie could be so hard. The heat from the lighting was intense and the actual fucking was difficult. She would just get comfortable and get into a rhythm when someone would yell "cut" and she would have to stop and change positions. In over an hour of off again,on again fucking she'd not had one enjoyable moment; the tingle she was used to feeling when she was screwing just wasn't there, so it came as somewhat of a let down, when after five minutes of being dicked by her co-star someone hollered, "Okay, give us the cum shot." Her partner pulled out of her, moved up to her head, stroked himself and then shot his load of cum all over her face. "Cut!" someone hollered, "Good job people. Get her cleaned up Sylvia. Times awasting and time is money." 

Susan had a hard time believing it. She had been fucked by five different men for over three hours and had gotten nothing out of it. Ten minutes at home with a dildo would have given here more. When it had come time for the lesbian scene she was surprised to find that her co-star would be Gloria, and even more surprised to find that it wasn't as bad as she had feared it would be, but she knew that it would never be her 'thing'. Finally, someone hollered, "Cut! It's a wrap. All right guys, go for it," and Susan was suddenly surrounded by a bunch of men stripping off their clothes. 

"What's going on?" she had asked and Gloria had smiled at her, "It's their version of a wrap party. Relax, enjoy it." 

For the next two hours she and Gloria had taken on every man who was there, some more than once, and Susan had had more than enough orgasms to make up for what she didn't get during the filming. At one point, when she had been on her hands and knees sucking one cock while another pounded her from behind, she had looked over to find Gloria in the same position and she wondered why they didn't just film this instead of the stupid movie. Fifteen minutes later, when she had a cock up her ass, one in her pussy and one in her mouth while two guys held her up so she could jack both of them off, she had the thought again - this would have been Academy Award stuff. When it was over and she was dressed and getting ready to leave Diamano handed her a piece of paper and a pen. "What's this?" she'd asked. 

"A model release. Sign it." 

She signed on the line he indicated and gave him back the form. He handed her another piece of paper; "This is a phone number where you can reach me. You did okay today. With some work and a little direction you could do even better. The usual fee for what you did today is $3000. Not bad for less than six hours work. Then of course, there is the cast party, which you seemed to enjoy. Think about it." 

Susan wadded up the piece of paper in her hand and was about to throw it on the floor, but she hesitated at the last moment and put it in her purse. She picked up little Andy and looked at her watch. She had just enough time to get home and fix Brian his dinner.  

===

It had been three months since Susan had been forced to make the porno film and her life had settled down some. She was still seeing five or six guys a week at a $100 a pop and she had done two more stag parties that Andy and Jerome had set up. She had even made two more films for Diamano. She didn't need the money - the track was closed for the season, but she had come to love all the sex she was having and why not make money at it? She figured she could have a very nice nest egg when the track reopened. Diamano wanted her to make more films, and had even offered to up her fee from $3000 to $4000. She hated making the films, but the wrap parties were great. She was in the kitchen fixing dinner when she heard her husband come in the front door. She went to the fridge and got the pitcher of ice cold vodka martinis she'd made and poured Brian a glass. When he came into the kitchen she walked up to him and handed him the martini and was about to kiss him when he threw the drink into her face. He grabbed her by the arm and dragged her into the living room and threw her down on the couch. 

"Just you sit there and keep your fucking mouth shut" he commanded as he walked over to the TV and VCR. Taking a videotape out of his coat pocket he shoved it in the VCR and turned on the TV. He turned to her as the picture formed on the screen, "The Restless Housewife" starring Tracey Cummings in her debut as America's new porn queen" rolled across the screen and then she saw herself. The blood drained from her face as Brian said, "This little gem showed up on my desk last week in an envelope from our Los Angeles office with a note that said, "Thought you ought to know." "At first I didn't want to believe it, but there is no denying that it's you. It made me wonder about what else you were doing while you were supposed to be here taking care of the house and raising my son, so I hired a private detective" and he reached into his briefcase and took out a large manila envelope which he tossed at her. 

"Open it up." 

Numbly she did what she was told and took out the contents, a large stack of 8 x 10 glossies. They were pictures of her with every one of the men she had fucked over the last week, and some of them even showed her collecting the money. She couldn't think of anything to say so she just stared down at her lap. 

"How long has this been going on and for God's sake, why?" 

Susan started to weep and as the tears trickled down her cheeks. Brian snorted in disgust, "Don't pull that 'poor me' crap on me cause I ain't buying it. Stop your damn crying and answer my question." 

Susan got up from the couch and ran for the bedroom and threw herself down on the bed. Brian followed her into the room and grabbed her by the arm and pulled her off the bed and pitched her onto the floor saying, "This is my bed and my bedroom and you are no longer welcome in either one. Now answer my question or I'll throw your sorry ass out into the street." 

Between sobs Susan told Brian the whole story, even the parts he could have never found out about. She told him about how she had felt forced into it the first few times, but then how she'd come to enjoy all the sex and the different variety she experienced. When she was done Brian had shaken his head and said, "I can't believe that you could have been so utterly stupid. You can use the guest room until I decide what I'm going to do about this" and then he walked out of the room leaving her sobbing on the floor. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was two days before Brian spoke to her again and during those two days she had stopped taking calls from Andy, Jerome, and all of her other regulars. She let the answering machine take them and then she erased them before Brian got home. She kept the house clean, did the laundry and the shopping; she fixed his dinner and left it on the stove and she made sure that she and little Andy were in the guestroom when he got home. She'd had plenty of time to think about her situation and while she knew Brian was justified in his anger, she also knew that cowering and hiding in the guestroom wasn't going to accomplish anything. She needed to start planning the rest of her life - a life she had never envisioned without Brian. She loved him, she always had, and the fact that she had come to love the cocks of many others wasn't going to change that. She had $10300 saved from selling her pussy and making movies and that would be enough to get her an apartment somewhere and furnish it, and she could find a job. She smiled at that - I already have a trade, she thought, and a loyal customer base. She decided she would move out the next day while Brian was at work. 

That night Brian had called her into the kitchen; "I've decided what we are going to do. I've decided that given what you've become, to use your talents to my advantage. For years now I've been supplying my out of town customers with whores and paying for them out of my commission checks. This has reduced my take home on some paydays, but I eventually made it back on increased sales. I don't have to do that anymore. From now on you will take care of them." 

Susan was shocked at what she was hearing. Her Brian, her darling stick in the mud self righteous Brian paying for prostitutes, and now he expected her to do it in their place (not that she would mind of course). Maybe she didn't know this man at all. 

"Do I have any say in this?" she asked. 

"Absolutely" Brian replied, You can say yes or you can pack your bags and say goodbye." 

Susan knew she was going to say yes, but first she said, "What about us?" 

Brian was silent for a minute and then he said, "I don't honestly know. Over the last few months you went from being mediocre in bed to being an absolutely marvelous piece of ass and I don't really want to give that up, but I don't know that I'll ever be able to trust you again." 

Susan stood up and said, "You have to trust me now - I'm your new business partner and the Absolutely Marvelous Piece of Ass is on her way to the bedroom where she will be waiting for an Absolutely Marvelous Fucking" and she headed for their bedroom. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

As the elevator made it's way slowly up to the thirty-second floor Susan thought back on the last six months of her life and how she had changed. She had gone from being a reluctant cocksucker to being an avid one; from hating anal sex to loving it; from nursing a prejudice against blacks, Asians, and Latinos to not caring about the color of the cock as long as it was hard. But by far the biggest change had come in her marriage. Her sex life with Brian had run the gamut from four to five times a week when they were first married, to twice a week and then to twice a month and now they were suddenly back to damn near every day. It had not been a sudden thing of course, but it had not taken long once Brian started sending her out to fuck his customers and clients. 

She had come home one night from dinner, dancing, and no holds barred sex with one of Brian's customers to find him sitting in front of the TV masturbating while watching her porno tape (the first one- Diamano hadn't yet sent her copies of the other two). It was at that point she knew that her marriage was safe. In bed that night Brian had asked her how it had gone and instead of just saying "all right" she had described the evening in graphic detail and it had inflamed Brian. He had become insane with lust and had fucked her for over two hours. In the morning she had been awakened by Brian eating her pussy - a pussy that still had the cum of two men in it. 

From there it had progressed to him wanting to see her in action and so one night she had Andy and Jerome come over after putting little Andy to bed and they had fucked her to exhaustion while Brian had watched from the closet. Once they left he had come out of the closet and had tried to fuck her to death and then he had gone down on her and sucked every bit of the cum out of her. Now once or twice a week he watched from the closet while she fucked and sucked some one or some ones, and then he would come out and fuck her and then drain her of cum. He particularly liked it when she had four or five guys fuck her, and he had even talked her into calling Diamano and telling him she would make more porno flicks for him. And while he hadn't yet suggested it, she knew it was only a matter of time before he came out of the closet and began to participate. 

Susan knocked on the door of room 3217 and a fairly good-looking man of about forty answered it. Past him she saw two more men in the room. Susan smiled and said, "Good evening. I believe I'm the evenings entertainment" and she walked into the room. Report_Story
