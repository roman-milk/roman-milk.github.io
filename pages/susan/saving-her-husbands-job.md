title: Saving Her Husband's Job

#1 

===

Bob Brandt could not believe what he was hearing. For fifteen years he had worked his ass off trying to go places with his company and now, just as he had reached the pinnacle of success, a vice presidency, he was being told he might not even have a job come tomorrow. Matt Brown, president and CEO, looked at him and repeated: 

"That's the deal Bob. You get the VP slot, stock options, year-end bonuses, and I get to fuck your wife. I don't get to fuck Tina and you can start job hunting." 

Bob sat in the chair, stiff as a wooden carving. Starting over at thirty-eight? Unthinkable! In a new company it would take another ten or fifteen years to reach where he was now and by then he would be too old. These day's companies wanted their executives to be young and hard-charging, not old and nearing retirement. His thoughts were interrupted by Matt: 

"Well, what's it to be?" 

Bob looked at him for a moment and then said, "Even if I agreed Tina would never do it. As soon as I asked her she would throw me out of the house and file for divorce." 

Matt asked, "Does that mean you agree in principal and are just not sure as to method?" 

Bob nodded his head and said yes. 

"Good! You are now VP of sales. I'll have the paperwork back dated to the first of the month. This was a test Bob. At the VP level some pretty tough choices have to be made, a lot of them distasteful, and I had to know if you had the guts to make a hard call. The one you just made is probably the hardest you will ever have to face. I'm throwing a promotion party for you at my place this Saturday. My wife is in Paris so all you have to do is show up with Tina and then let whatever happens happen." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Bob made one last adjustment to his tie and turned to look at his wife. Tina was stunning in a white mini dress, high heels, with a single strand of pearls around her slender throat; her beautiful oval face set off to perfection by bright green eyes and long lustrous black hair. He hated what he was about to subject her to, but at the same time he told himself that he was doing it for her, so she could continue to live in the style that she had become accustomed to. Besides, deep down he did not think she would let herself be seduced by Matt - he had faith in her. 

The party was one hour old and Bob could see that Tina was already 'tipsy'. Matt had been very attentive and had seen to it that the glass in her hand never fell below half empty. It was apparent to Bob that Matt's strategy was to get Tina drunk and it seemed to be working. By the end of the second hour Bob knew that Tina was hot enough to fuck. She had danced with every single male at the party and a few of the married ones and Bob knew that quite a few of them had been feeling her up and poking their stiff dicks into her legs. This was normal for what happened to Tina at parties and it used to upset Bob, but Tina told him that she enjoyed the attention and that he ended up getting all the benefits when the guys got her hot so he should just relax and go with the flow. In fact, when he had danced with her she'd told him that they might not even make it all the way home before she took his pants off of him. 

At eleven thirty people started leaving and Matt came up to him and told him that if he wanted to he could watch from the closet in the master bedroom or if he preferred not to he could wait in the den or leave and come back later. Bob toyed with the idea of leaving, but curiosity won out - he had to know if Tina would do it and if she did, how it would happen. About fifteen minutes later Matt nodded at him and Bob went upstairs and took his place in the closet. 

Ten minutes later Matt and Tina entered the bedroom. Tina was drunk, but not so drunk that she was unaware that she was in a bedroom not hers. 

"What are we doing here?" she asked. 

Matt led her over to the bed and sat her down, "We are here because you have a decision to make and this is the one place where we won't be interrupted." 

"What decision?" Tina asked. 

Matt said, "You have to decide whether or not Bob has a future with the company." 

Tina looked confused, "What are you talking about. He was just made a VP." 

Matt's voice took on a somber tone; "Yesterday the board of directors made a decission to downsize certain areas of the company. I have to get rid of two of my vice-presidents and consolidate their functions under the two remaining. Bob is last on board so technically he should be the first to be let go, but I like Bob and I think it would be better for the company if he were to stay. If I keep him I'll take a lot of heat from the board and the stockholders. I can justify my decission if I have to, but why should I risk it? On the other hand, I could take the risk if there was a reward for doing it." 

Tina stared at him, "What are you saying?" she asked. 

"Simple" said Matt, "I've wanted you in my bed since the first time I saw you and now I have an opportunity to make it happen." 

Tina looked at him with a stunned expression, "You can't possibly mean...." but Matt cut her off, "Oh but I do Tina, I most assuredly do mean it." 

While he had been talking he had pulled his stiff dick out of his pants and now it danced only inches from Tina's face. She watched it bob and jerk as if mesmerized and in a very weak voice said, "You're mad!" 

"No baby, just horny" replied Matt. 

"This is crazy," said Tina. "I can't do it! I love my husband and if he ever found out he'd leave me and that's not a risk I'm willing to take." 

Matt smiled and said, "There is no risk. George and Cynthia were too drunk to drive and I had Bob take them home. It will be an hour and a half before he gets back." 

Tina was silent for several moments and then she said, "You promise me that Bob will never know?" 

Matt said, "Not from me and you and I are the only ones who will know about it." 

Tina sat there silent and from the closet Bob was trying to will her to agree to do it, not because of the promotion, but because suddenly he wanted to see her fuck another man. He wanted to watch her wrap her mouth around a strange cock; see her hands caress some other guy's balls and watch his cum run down her cheeks. "Do it baby, do it!" ran through his mind like a chant. 

Matt stepped forward until his cock touched Tina's cheek and then he took hold of it and began to move it back and forth across her face. Tina looked up at him and weakly asked, "You promise?" Matt nodded a yes and Tina opened her mouth and took him in. 

For the next hour Bob watched as his lovely wife fucked his boss. At first she was just passive and sat there as Matt worked his cock back and forth in her mouth. And then Bob had seen a change come over her as tentatively her left hand came up and moved to the cheeks of Matt's ass and then her right hand had come up. Tina pulled Matt into her mouth and she started giving him a blowjob that Bob, who had been the recipient of many of them himself, knew would drive Matt wild. 

Tina went from passive to aggressive and by the time Matt had his clothes off and Tina had slipped out of hers Matt was no longer in control. Tina sucked him, fucked him and then sucked him hard again. She was insatiable. Finally Matt said: 

"It's almost time for Bob to get back. We need to stop." 

Tina laughed at him, "What's the matter. Can't keep it up? You wanted me honey, and now you've got me and you're telling me you can't handle it. Poor baby." 

Matt, stung by the sarcasm, said "I'll show you who can't handle it" and he rolled Tina over onto her stomach. 

Tina laughed again, "Good! If I have to be a slut tonight you might as well take my ass to." 

With a roar Matt pushed his cockhead at Tina's little brown eye and pushed. Bob saw Tina clench her teeth and grimace as Matt kept pushing his cock into her ass, but he knew she loved to be ass fucked and that in only moments she would be begging him to fuck her harder. It was a full five minutes before Matt emptied himself in her ass and as he pulled out of her and collapsed on to the bed next to her, Tina rolled over and leaned on her elbow. She smiled at Matt: 

"I'd like to suck your cock again and fuck you one more time, but I guess I should make myself presentable for Bob when he gets here" and she got up and went into the bathroom. 

As soon as she was out of the room Bob got out of the closet and headed downstairs and he was in the kitchen making himself a drink when Tina and Matt came down the stairs. Bob looked at Tina, but she showed no signs of the sexual encounter she'd just had. Matt on the other hand looked worn out. Bob said: 

"I looked for you to tell you where I was going, but I couldn't find you." 

Tina patted his arm, "No problem. Matt kept me entertained while we waited for you to get back." She turned to Matt and said, "It's late and we need to get going. Thank you ever so much for the party. Maybe we can do it again sometime" and she stood on tiptoe and kissed Matt on the cheek leaving Bob to ponder on the "maybe we can do it again sometime." Did she mean...? No, Bob thought, she couldn't. Could she? 

To be continued.

Tina made a final adjustment to her garter belt and nylons and then she stepped into her 4 inch "come fuck me" pumps. She looked at herself in the full-length mirror and thought, "Tina my love, you look like a slut, which I suppose is fitting, since that is what you have become." And then she giggled, "I am a slut and I love it." 

She and Bob had been married for fifteen years and in all that time she had never been unfaithful to him (although she had fantasized about fucking other men). There were even times when she had almost done it, but she never had. She was in love with her husband and she knew he would never understand her desire for seeing what another cock would be like so she had behaved herself and had taken her sexual frustration out on Bob by trying to fuck him to death every time they were alone. That is she had been faithful until the night of his promotion party. That night, for reasons that didn't matter anymore, she had gone to bed with her husband's boss and she had loved it. She had not been surprised when Matt had called her two days later and asked if he could stop by and talk to her. She knew that if she said yes they would end up in her bed, but she had hesitated only a moment before telling him to come over. She had just gotten out of the tub and only had a robe on and she debated getting dressed, but then thought it would be a waste of time. After all, she was going to have to get naked again to get fucked, right? 

The doorbell rang and when she opened the door she had expected Matt to take her in his arms, kiss her and pick up where they had left off on the night of the party. It came as a surprise to her when he said: 

"Thank you for agreeing to see me on such short notice." 

She led him into the living room and offered him a cup of coffee or a drink and he'd said, "Just coffee please, black." 

When she had given him the coffee and sat down in the chair opposite she had said, "And to what do I owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit?" 

Matt had taken a sip of his coffee and then he put the cup down on the coffee table, "I need some help in closing a million dollar deal. I have a customer that I need to wine and dine. I need to see to it that he has such a good time that he would never, ever take his business to anyone else. In short, I need to turn a sexpot loose on him, someone who will fuck him damn near to death and leave him begging for more of the same. After the way you worked me over the other night I knew you were the woman for the job." 

Tina had not expected that and she sat there with a look of incredulity on her face. "You can't be serious," she'd said. 

Matt had replied, "Oh, but I am. There is no doubt in my mind that you loved every second of what happened the other night." 

Tina had said, "That was the other night and I did that to save my husbands career. The fact that I enjoyed it doesn't mean that I'm going to make a habit of it." 

Matt had looked at her for a moment before saying, "Honey, Bob's career was never in jeopardy. That was just a story I used to get you into my bed. It was rotten of me and I know it, but I had wanted you for so long that when the opportunity presented itself I had to take it. And" he continued, "I am glad that I did. It was the most memorable night of my life. But in order for Bob's career to flourish the company has to flourish and it is deals like the one I'm trying to close that will ensure the company's continued success. I could fix this guy up with a high-class call girl and she would suck his cock and fuck him, but then she would straighten her make-up and leave. He would be sexually content, but he would know that he'd just spent time with another high dollar call girl. I want him to be left exhausted and hoping to God it might happen again. I want him to feel that if he keeps giving his business to me that it could happen again. For that I need the woman who fucked my brains out the other night - I need you." 

Tina had said, "I'm flattered that you think so highly of me, but I'm sorry. This is just something that I can't do." 

Matt had shaken his head, "I was afraid that was going to be your answer and I had hoped that I wouldn't have to do it this way." He'd gotten up and had taken videotape out of his coat pocket and had handed it to her. "Here. Play this." 

Tina had taken the tape and had placed in the VCR. She sat down just in time to see Matt rub his cock over her lips and then she saw her mouth open and engulf Matt's cock. She had looked at Matt; "You promised me that Bob would never find out." 

Matt shrugged, "What can I say, I lied. But he doesn't have to find out, does he? All you have to do is what I'm asking you to do and Bob never sees the tape." 

Tina had not answered him. She'd watched the tape of her letting herself go so completely in Matt's bed and by the time the tape ended she had wanted to fuck. She'd stood up, let the robe fall from her shoulders and had headed for the bedroom. Half way there she had turned to see if he was following - he was. When Matt had left, some three hours later, he left knowing that Tina would do what he wanted. 

+++++++++++++++ 

Matt arranged for Bob to be out of town on the night that Tina was to meet Matt's customer and the night had proven to be everything that Matt had hoped for. The customer, his name was Dan, had wined and dined her and then had taken her to his hotel room. She had done a slow strip for him and then had sucked his cock until he had exploded in her mouth. She has swallowed every drop and then she had licked him clean and in the process had gotten him hard again and then she had fucked him. And then she had done it again and again until he was exhausted and waved her away when she went to suck on his cock one more time. She'd had so many orgasms that her legs were a little rubbery when she got up to go to the bathroom to clean herself up. As she was letting herself out the door Dan had said: 

"Wait. When can I see you again?" 

She had smiled at him and said, "Ask Matt." 

It was only in the elevator on the way down to the lobby that she had realized what she'd just done. When she had said "Ask Matt" she had willingly accepted her new position as the company whore. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

And now, here she was again, getting ready to cement another one of Matt's deals. She wondered what tonight's client would be like. He would be the tenth one since Matt had blackmailed her into doing the first. Tina had fond memories of the first nine; there hadn't been a loser in the bunch. Oh, a few had seemed sexually inexperienced, but she had corrected that problem before she was done with them. She'd even had her first, and she sincerely hoped not her last, threesome, and she had gloried in the feeling of superiority when she had left them both lying exhausted on the bed. 

There had been no more talk of blackmail since then, only Matt calling and saying, "Honey, I need a favor" and away she went to practice her whorish ways. Matt came by two or three times a week and they would spend all day in her bed and when Bob came home that night she would attack him like some demented sex fiend. It seemed like the more she fucked around on him the more she wanted to fuck him. Once she'd left an afternoon meeting with one of Matt's customers and had gone directly to Bob's office and she had sucked his cock as he sat at his desk, relishing the splash of cum that hit the back of her throat and then slid down into her belly to mingle with the customers cum. 

She finished her makeup and slid into the black cocktail dress. She checked her purse to make sure she had everything and then she headed for the front door. This was going to be an all-nighter so Matt had shipped Bob out of town again. Matt said that the client would send a car for her and she had stepped outside expecting to find a cab and instead she found a long black limo. The driver got out and opened the door for her and as she settled into the plush interior she wondered what other surprises the night might hold for her. She didn't have long to wait. A tall, slim black man with wide shoulders answered her knock on the door to room 1216. 

"Well, well," shed thought, "I've never had a black man before. This should be interesting" and she stepped into the room. 

To be continued...

Bob was halfway to the airport when he realized that he'd left a folder full of information that he would need on this trip on his desk at home. He looked at his watch and saw that he still had enough time to get home, get the papers, and still make it to the airport in time for his flight. He turned onto his street just in time to see Tina come down the front steps and get into a long black limo. What the hell is going on he thought as the limo pulled away from the curb and he followed, all thoughts of the folder on his desk gone from his mind. He was surprised when the limo pulled up at the Hilton and Tina got out. He looked for a place to park and found one close by, but then he hesitated. The limo was still there - waiting for Tina to come back out? He decided to sit tight and see what would happen. 

Five minutes passed, then ten and just as Bob thought that he might have guessed wrong, Tina came out of the hotel on the arm of a tall black man that Bob instantly recognized. John Wright was one of the company's biggest customers and his company was responsible for a good twenty percent of Bob's company's bottom line. But what was he doing with Tina, or better yet, what was Tina doing with him? He followed them to Carl's ChopHouse and then one hour later to one of the many nightspots that dot the Lower East Side. He couldn't take a chance on getting caught spying on his wife so he had to be content with waiting outside and keeping an eye on the limo. 

But he didn't have to be inside to know what was going on. Tina would be drinking and dancing and after several drinks he knew that Tina would stop pushing Wright's hands away. Two hours later they came out of the nightclub and Bob followed the limo back to the Hilton. Tina and Wright went inside the hotel and the limo pulled away. With a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach Bob knew that Tina would not be coming out until morning, and with that realization came the certain sure knowledge that Tina and Wright had not met accidentally. There was only one way the two of them could have gotten together. 

Matt Brown stumbled groggily to the front door wondering who in hell could be ringing his doorbell at two in the morning. He opened the door to find Bob Brandt standing on his doorstep. 

"Bob! What are you doing here? You are supposed to be in Atlanta." 

Matt was so surprised at seeing Bob that he never saw the right cross that sent him tumbling to the floor. Bob stepped inside and kicked the door shut behind him. 

"Why am I supposed to be in Atlanta Matt? To take care of legitimate business or to get me out of the way?" Bob reached down to help the older man to his feet. 

"Who is it Matt?" a voice called. In a voice slurred because of a fat lip Matt said, "It's Bob sweetheart. He's here about a business matter." 

Matt turned and walked toward his study and Bob followed. Matt went straight to the wet bar and fixed two drinks. He handed one to Bob and then he touched his jaw, "Why did you do that?" he asked. 

"You know damn well why! What I want to know is how did you get her to do it?" 

Matt smiled a rueful smile, "Quite simple. I blackmailed her. She's done quite well for the company. I would imagine that your bonus alone on the deals she has closed for me will be in excess of a hundred thousand." 

Bob was stunned. "How long has this been going on?" 

"Since the night of your promotion party. I taped my little romp with Tina and then I told her I would show it to you if she didn't cooperate." 

A voice behind Bob said, "He's quite good at that" and Bob turned to see Laura Brown walk into the room. "Quite good at getting women to close his business deals I mean. He used to have me doing it until he thought I was getting too old and too fat." 

Bob looked at the ample curves barely hidden behind the almost transparent black nightie and thought "old and fat my ass." 

Laura went on, "He didn't have to blackmail me though, I did it willingly and loved every minute of it. I've always suspected that the real reason behind his making me quit was that I was liking it too much. Now I have to satisfy myself with the pool man, the TV repairman and whomever else I can find to scratch the itch." She turned to her husband, "Run along Matt. I'll handle this and then I'll be up." 

Matt smiled at her and left the room. Laura turned to Bob and said, "He loves to fuck me when I'm full of another man's cum. We aren't going to disappoint him, are we?" She noticed the look on Bob's face. "What? Are you going to tell me that you didn't dive right into Tina's wet pussy as soon as you could after Matt fucked her?" 

From the sheepish look on Bob's face she knew that she had hit home. "I'll bet you are sorry now that you missed out on fucking her all the times she's worked for Matt. Well, if you are good to me I'll see to it that you are home in time to fuck her in the morning. She will still be full of John's cum for you. Don't you worry. Tina is having a good time with John tonight. I know I did when John fucked me." She saw the look on Bob's face and said, "Of course I know all about it. Matt and I are partners and we have no secrets from each other. You might be surprised at how full your life can become if you and Tina adopt the same philosophy." 

The whole time she was talking she had been undoing his pants and as his cock sprang out of confinement Laura said, "Ooh, that's a nice one" and she bent to take him in her mouth. Although Bob had no way of knowing it, at the exact instant that he sent the first of several loads into a willing Laura, across town his wife Tina was receiving her first load of many. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Tina was surprised to find Bob on their bed when she got home and she was even more surprised when he got up and pushed her onto her back on the bed. He pushed her dress up and pulled down her panties: 

"Did you clean up or is he still in you?" 

It took a second for what Bob had just said to register, "You know?" Bob nodded. Tina said, "There's probably a pint of him still there" and at those words Bob thrust himself inside her. 

For the rest of the day they went at each other like animals in heat and it wasn't until late in the evening that they were too tired to continue. They lay in bed, side by side, and Tina told Bob of her sexual escapades and how much she had enjoyed them. Bob told her about how he found out, the trip to Matt's and his interlude with Laura. The only hostility surfaced when Bob told Tina about his promotional talk with Matt and how he had agreed to let Matt try and seduce her. Tina's anger went away when he convinced her that he only agreed because he knew that Matt wouldn't be able to do it. 

"I guess I was wrong about that." 

Tina, somewhat embarrassed at how easily she had given in to Matt, changed the subject back to Laura. Tina asked, "Was she as good as me?" and Bob had smiled at her, "Honey, no one is as good as you." They fell asleep in each other's arms. 

Two days later Tina was awakened by Bob who was dragging his tongue up and down the slit between her cunt lips. The bedside phone rang and Tina picked it up. It was Matt, "Tina honey, I need as favor." 

"Hang on" she said, "I'll have to ask Bob." 

Bob looked up from what he was doing and nodded his head yes as he continued work on her pussy. "Matt? Bob says it's okay, but listen, he needs Laura to take care of someone, okay?" She listened for a few minutes and then said, "Thanks. I'll have Bob call her with the details." She hung up the phone and giggled, "God, are we wicked" and then she twisted so she could sixty-nine with her hubby. Report_Story
