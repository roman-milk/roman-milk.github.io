=========================== 

A broken man, an innocent injured girl, a time for healing. 

A twisted story of loss, control, humiliation, healing and strangely enough, romance. 

This is an entry for the 2015 Summer Lovin' Contest. It's been in my unfinished pile since 2012, and I finally manage to complete it. I hope you enjoy the story. It's another one of my 'unusual' tales, dealing with what in other situations might be a fetish, with elements of non-consent, although it comes about in a round-about way. 

It could be categorized many ways, but because of the principal activity, I've gone ahead and listed it as fetish. 

=========================== 

"I should have let him fuck me," Amy thought, the last of her strength fading. She was on her back, struggling to stay afloat, her throat parched, the fierce Caribbean sun scalding her exposed face. 

She thought about the events of the night before. Getting drunk for the first time, trying to fit in, necking on the diving platform with Rafe, their feet splashing in the water. 

It had been exciting. Even now she could feel his hands on her bare breasts, his mouth pressed against hers. When Rafe grabbed her hand and pressed it against his hardness, she'd felt fear, excitement, disgust, desire. He'd pulled her down, laying on the teak platform at the back of the boat, tugging at her bikini bottoms. 

YOLO. She wanted to be cool. Be included. But she wasn't ready for what he wanted. She was a virgin, a good girl, finally ready to stretch her boundaries. Be kissed, touched. Feel like a woman. The last summer before college on a barefoot cruise with a couple of dozen of her exclusive private school friends seemed like the time to spread her wings. Just not that far. 

Rafe had held her down, climbing on top of her. "No, Rafe," she moaned, trying to make herself heard over the loud party music and the rumble of the engines. "No!" 

"Don't be such a fuckin' tease," he'd growled, pulling the tie on the side of her bikini bottom, and yanking it free, leaving her naked. He'd reached between her legs, touching her. She'd shuddered, embarrassed that she was wet and excited. 

"Stop! Don't do this, please," she begged. "I ... I'll scream." 

He pushed the top of her body over the edge of the platform, her hair dragging in the water as they motored through the night. The wake splashed over her face, his hand around her neck, squeezing. 

"Lie still and enjoy it, Ames. You'll thank me afterward." He shifted, straddling her thighs, trying to press his hard meat against her. She twisted, fighting, her mouth and nose sprayed with the salty water, choking her. 

Rafe forced his leg between her thighs, using his free hand to press her knee outward. She clawed at the hand holding her throat, working her other leg free. Amy kicked out, connecting, proud for a moment, before she slipped under the water, tumbling in the dark murkiness, struggling for the surface. After an eternity, she broke free of the water's warm embrace, gasping. She tried to yell, but the boat's wake dunked her, her mouth filling with water. She coughed it up, panicking. 

Surrounded by nothing but disorienting darkness. Fear surged within her as she searched for the boat. She kicked upward, turning jerkily. Behind her to the left, the lights of the boat were fading in the distance. She screamed for help. Screamed and screamed, shouting, yelling, praying someone would hear her, anyone. The sounds of Bob Marley singing about love, echoing across the surface, destroyed her. 

She had no idea how long she'd been swimming, mostly floating, desperately straining to keep her head up. She knew she wouldn't be able to last much longer. 

What if she'd handled it differently? Not struggled. She wouldn't be a virgin forever. She could have let Rafe be her first. She'd be on the boat now, in his arms, laughing, joking along with all the others. No longer the last virgin on the trip. One of the gang. 

I should have let him fuck me. 

* * * 

Amy let the water carry her along, on her back, no longer swimming, all of her energy spent keeping her head up, breathing. Her vision was a blur, lips cracked and painful. She was dizzy. She wanted to take a mouthful of water and swallow, anything to stop the agonizing thirst. Amy knew that one sip could be the end. Would that be so bad? She was so tired, aching, hungry, thirsty. It would be so easy to slip under the surface. She felt something bump against her foot, and kicked away hard, terrified of what was in the water with her. She wasn't ready to give up yet. 

Another hard bump and she turned on her side, kicking fearfully. Water swept over her face. She gasped, struggling to stay upright and another wave of water buried her. She rolled with it, scraping her knee. She fought to the surface, taking a huge desperate breath, and felt sand underneath her feet. 

She crawled forward on trembling arms, tumbled by a wave, digging her fingers into the rough sand, pushing up and forward, the water impelling her toward the shore. Crawling out of the frothy surf, she managed to escape the tide surge, before she let the weight of her own body force her down. She was alive. 

* * * 

Amy woke, the sun low on the horizon. Every inch of her body hurt. She rolled onto her back, and almost screamed from the pain. She had to get up. Find water. Find cover. Find help. 

Her face was in shade. She squinted, her eyes unable to focus, dry and blinded by the vicious sun. She could make out a shape. Lifting her head, her swollen tongue tried to ask for help, but only a rasping gasp came out. She felt a hard poke in her side. 

"Get off my beach," she heard in a deep baritone. The poke became a blow. The man was kicking her. He dug his toes under her side and pushed, flipping her over toward the water edge. 

"Leave. You're trespassing," he growled. His voice sounded rough, the words tentative, as if he wasn't used to speaking. 

"Please," she cried. Even her ears detected little more than a grunt. 

He kicked her harder, and she rolled over twice down the steep beach, catching herself before she slid back in to her certain death. 

He stood over her, one leg on each side of her body. "If I see you again, I'll shoot you." She looked up and saw what had to be a rifle barrel pointed at her head. 

She closed her eyes and waited for the impact. 

* * * 

Fucking kids, Hunter thought. No fucking respect. 

He hoped he'd put the fear of God into the brat. Skinny-dipping and sunning on his beach. He scanned the sea, trying to spot her boat. Had to be one of those damn rich kid outings. Every other month it seemed he had to chase some damn bunch of punks off his property. Why the fuck were they suddenly showing up? For two years, he saw maybe one boat in a month, always at a distance. Now it was two or three times a week. At least most had the good sense not to come too close, the reefs and submerged atolls a danger for anyone stupid enough to hazard them. 

He turned his back on her, avoiding the view of her nakedness. He didn't need that. Fucking immoral little sluts, all of them. Rutting on his property. She'd slink off like the good little skank she was. Probably be opening her legs to some acned teenager, laughing at him before the night was through. 

* * * 

It was almost dark. Amy was so weak she could only crawl, following the footsteps in the sand. She stopped when she had to, slithering forward when she could. Keep moving, she thought. Water, he has to have water. 

There was wood under her fingers. Spaced boards. Some kind of walkway. It hurt her body even worse than the sand, tearing at her sore breasts, grinding the sand into her knees. Nothing like the pain of her parched throat. Amy wriggled forward, and felt moisture. Water. Water! She brought her fingers to her mouth, tasting it. It was hot, but it was sweet. No salt. She struggled forward and felt it against her arm. One last push and her face was laying in it. Shallow, only a couple of inches deep and sandy on the bottom. She didn't care. She sipped carefully, coughing, then drank more. It was the most wonderful thing she'd ever tasted. She drank deeply, accidentally inhaling the water through her nose, gagging. She rolled onto her back so she could breath, ignoring the physical pain, the water caressing the back of her head. 

She took several slow breaths, feeling a little strength return to her limbs. She turned back over and drank more carefully, bringing her trembling hands up and washing her face. She had no idea how long she was there, but she felt peaceful. She was going to live. There was fresh water. Food. People. Not everyone had to be as coarse as that first stranger. 

Amy noticed she was at the foot of some stairs. She could almost see again, her vision slowly returning. It was still difficult, but no longer impossible. She crawled up the steps, counting them. Six. Six steps and she was on a wooden deck. A building. Lights. 

On her hands and knees she approached the door. Blue. It was painted blue. She leaned against it. She reached up and pushed her hair back out of her face. She lifted her fist, and hammered on the door with the last of her fading strength. 

* * * 

Hunter heard the noise again. He got up from his desk, and walked to the door. Opening it, he found that same damn girl, obviously drunk, falling into his house. 

He reached down and grabbed her by her long blonde hair, making a fist and pulling her upright. She was so drunk she barely reacted. Fucking slut. "I warned you," he growled. "Crawl back to your fuck-buddies, you little whore. I'm not buying any of it." 

"Help," she whispered. 

"Right. Party a little too rough for you? Not my concern. Get off my porch. Get off my island. Next time I see you, you won't like it." He threw her off his doorstep and slammed the door. 

Amy didn't know how her desiccated body was able to dredge up enough moisture for tears. 

* * * 

Hunter looked out, and she was laying there. Shaking. So God damn stupid. She was badly sunburned, not even enough brains to wear sunscreen. Her friends would probably find her soon. 

As he was turning off his lights, he opened the blinds and she was still there. Naked. On his porch. No effort to cover herself. How much did the little slut drink? Drugs maybe. Probably. Little ecstasy for the high. She'd pay for it in the morning. 

He couldn't believe his own actions when he went to his kitchen. He threw some fruit and bread on a plate. A tall glass of water. Tylenol. He went outside and put it by her head. He went back in and returned with an old blanket and tossed it over her. 

Fuck. I'm getting soft. Whore will probably steal the blanket. 

He closed the door and locked it. Didn't need her breaking in and stealing anything else. 

* * * 

Amy woke, surprised she was still alive. She turned, the rough blanket like sandpaper against her hyper-sensitive flesh. She heard an odd clanking sound, and saw a plate shaking where she'd bumped into it. Pineapple? Melon? Bread? She struggled to sit up, pushing the irritating cloth off of her. The sun wasn't up, but it was bright enough to see the tall glass of water, and the plate of food. She clasped the glass in her trembling hands, sipping carefully. She reached for a chunk of melon and put it in her mouth, feeling it, sucking on it before she carefully chewed and swallowed. More water. She noticed the small white pills, and hesitated. It could be anything. Then again, if he really wanted her dead or incapacitated, she wouldn't be there now. 

She took the pills, and washed them down. Bite by delicious bite, she ate the drying fruit and stale bread. She didn't know if she'd ever eaten anything better in her life. When the food was gone and glass was empty, she surveyed her surroundings. There was a lounge chair a few feet away. She climbed onto it, dragging her blanket with her. She sighed. She was going to live. She pulled the blanket over herself and went to sleep. 

* * * 

Amy woke suddenly. Someone was leaning over her. 

"Are you stupid? Still drunk? I told you to leave." 

She licked her lips, "Please, I can't." She didn't recognize her own raspy voice. 

"Where are your friends?" 

She realized he was holding the rifle again. 

"No friends. I'm lost. Swam all night." Her voice was a little stronger. 

"You can't stay here." He sounded angry. 

"Thank you for ... food and blanket. Do you have more water?" she asked. 

He grunted. She watched him turn to the wall, grabbing her glass and filling it from a faucet. All the water she could drink, and only a few feet away. She laughed, her sides aching until she was crying again. 

"Funny. Ha-ha. Here's your fucking water. You can keep the blanket. Just leave." 

She took the glass in her hand, drinking it, all of it, gasping for air between gulps. She reached out to put it on the deck, her hand trembling wildly. The man took it from her. "You're still here." 

She looked up, getting used to the glare. She lifted her hand to her brow, shading her eyes. He was tall, gaunt. No beard, but several days of unshaven growth. His dark, almost black eyes burned into hers. "Where can I go?" she asked. 

"Not my problem. You can't stay here." 

"Can you point me to town?" she asked. 

He laughed, a vicious, cruel sound. He pointed across the water. "Maybe a dozen miles. Start swimming." 

She felt her eyes tear up. "Why do you hate me?" 

"I don't hate you. I detest you. You and your friends. Spoiled, immoral, irresponsible brats. Living off Daddy's money. No responsibilities, no respect for others. This is private property. The signs are on the beach. You can't miss 'em. No trespassing." 

"Please. Help me. I fell off our boat. I almost died. I need to get home." 

"Get a little drunk? High? Go for a late night swim, and your drunken boyfriends left you? Boo-hoo. Time to grow-up." 

She didn't want to argue. "Can you help me?" 

"No," he said. He picked up the plate and glass. "My charity for the year is all paid up. Now leave before I get angry. You wouldn't like me angry." 

She struggled to her feet. She was shaking and dizzy, but she knew she'd get no aid from this bastard. Not everyone was an asshole. She'd find help. She shuffled toward the stairs. "Thank you for the water and blanket," she said. 

* * * 

Hunter watched her walk away. Was any of it true? She was probably on some kind of stupid dare, like those brats six months ago. Most likely there was a boat waiting for her out of view, around the north or south side. He took her plate and glass inside. 

Fucking waste of my time. Now I'm behind schedule. He sat at his computer, powering it up, reviewing his notes. If he didn't get this chapter delivered, he'd never hear the end of it. 

* * * 

Amy pulled the blanket over her head, walking along the beach. Someone would help her. She kept her eyes on the tree line, looking for a break, a house, a path, anything. The broad expanse of tan sand narrowed, until she was wading in the water, following the rocky shore. Long way between houses. She knew she was sick. Probably the sunburn. She was weak, and couldn't stop shaking. But she was alive, and in 100% better shape than yesterday. 

She kept moving. Don't sit. Don't stop. You'll find help. Her feet were tortured, the rough sand and half buried shells tearing them up. The salt water burned. She could see what appeared to be other islands in the distance, small, barely rocks, not even as big as the island she was walking around. Not much help there, and they looked distant, but she had no way to estimate the distance. 

The beach opened up again, the sun almost directly over head. She'd wandered half the day already. She was able to walk in the cool compact sand just above the tide level. Any higher and the hot sand was too much against the blistered and broken soles of her feet. She saw a path up ahead. Finally. She turned up the beach, staggering along the sandy path until it became a boardwalk. A few more paces, and there was a washing pool where she was able to rinse off and cool her aching feet. Steps. Oh, God. No. Please. She looked up and saw a railing. A small bright yellow bungalow. Blue door. 

Shit. 

She shuffled up to the entrance, bracing herself. Whatever he said, whatever he called her, she'd take it. She had to have his help. She couldn't spend another day like this. Not another hour. 

* * * 

Hunter heard the knock at his door. Fuck. The bitch was back. What the hell? Had her friends really left her? That's all he needed. Some whiny, needy spoiled brat. The two-month supply boat wouldn't be back for weeks. Fuck. 

He rose to his feet, angry, and went to the door. 

"You." 

"Please. A phone call. All I need is a phone call," she begged. 

"No phone." 

She looked puzzled, as if the thought of anyone living without a phone was beyond comprehension. "A boat? Can you just take me to where I can make a call? My family has money. They'll pay you." 

He laughed, cruelly. "I'm sure they have money. All you brats are the same. I don't need your filthy money." 

"Please, help me. Something, anything," she pleaded. The slut leaned against the wall. His wall. His. 

"Why?" 

"Kindness? Karma? Because you can?" 

He laughed again, and slammed the door in her face. 

Like every other bitch. Wants something for nothing. Like Her. His evil conniving wife, raping his life, taking everything he had, while he was overseas, reservist, recruited against his wishes and forced to serve three years in Afghanistan and Iraq. Like that bitch of an attorney, determined to strangle the life out of him, make him work for his unfaithful slut-wife, taking his earnings, grinding his life away while she crawled from bed to bed. The lying cunt of a sister who hung him out to dry, keeping the whore's secrets. He showed them. Let them try to find him now. They'd get nothing from him. Not now. Not ever. 

Like this stupid little slut on his doorstep. Useless piece of flesh, a wart on society. Good for nothing but feeding off others. Flash her tits, give up a little ass, bare those bright white teeth in a fake smile, bat those baby blues, and always get her way. Daddy's little princess, leading him on, and he'd give her anything, guilty of his own desires toward the cum-slut living under his roof, giving it up to anyone who wanted. Anyone but him. 

Fuck if he'd be used again. 

* * * 

Amy sank to the ground. Her stomach was cramping from hunger. She crawled to the faucet and drank her fill, leaning against the hot wall. She reached down to her feet, peeling off the dead and peeling skin, blisters under her blisters, bleeding. She rinsed them off under the water. 

He couldn't do this to her. No civilized person could. It wasn't her fault she was stuck on his stupid island. It wasn't fair. 

She stood, cringing from the pain in her feet. She walked to the door, unsteadily, and tried the handle. Locked. She knocked on the door, over and over, when he didn't answer. 

Finally, he threw open the door. "Stop it, you stupid cunt! I'm working." 

"I'm hungry. I ... I have to have something to wear. I'm sick. I need more aspirin or something stronger," she told him, bravely, standing tall, looking him in the eye. 

"Like I care. Stay out there, on the beach. Boats pass by almost every day. Find a ride. You got yourself here, you can get yourself gone." 

She couldn't help but start crying. It didn't have to be like this. She only needed a little help. It would cost him nothing. 

"Sorry. That doesn't work on me. I've seen enough crocodile tears from little lying bitches to last a lifetime." 

"Why? Why are you treating me like this? I'm a person. I'm helpless. I'm hurting. You wouldn't treat a dog this way!"  

===

He grinned. "You're right. I wouldn't. A dog doesn't bite the hand that feeds it. A dog is loyal. It knows its place." He stared at her hard. "A dog wouldn't interrupt my work. Wouldn't sit here whining on my doorstep. Fuck, I wish you were a dog. Maybe you'd just lie down out of the way and shut the fuck up." 

Amy couldn't believe the bile and disgust that radiated from this man. He was broken inside. That much was obvious. She was stuck on a deserted island with a man who was probably unhinged. 

She sank to her knees, utterly and completely defeated. She was going to die here after all, because one man couldn't see her as a fellow human being. A misogynistic bastard, who for some reason obviously abhorred women. Her long hair, full breasts, narrow waist and tight ass were her greatest weaknesses versus her only potential savior. 

Amy got on her hands and knees. She hated herself with every movement she made, crawling to him. She leaned down and licked his bare foot, trembling when he jerked back a step. She hunkered down lower, crawling forward, licking his foot again. Licking his ankle when he didn't pull away. She rolled over onto her back, ignoring the agony, closing her legs and lifting her knees, covering her breasts with her elbows. She brought her hands to her chin, curling her fingers. She stretched, exposing her belly to him. She whimpered, whining. 

"Get up, you stupid little cunt," he growled. 

Amy bent her head to the side, wriggling closer, licking his ankle, whining deep down in her throat. She looked up at him, piteously. Please, she thought. Please, I'll be good. Feed me. Help me. 

* * * 

What the fuck? Hunter looked down at the girl, seeing her bleeding feet, scraped, blistering skin. Pitiful despairing look. She was licking him. Whimpering and whining like a whipped cur. 

"Stay," he barked. 

He went to his kitchen. Opened a can of cold beef stew and dumped it in a bowl. Filled another bowl with water. He couldn't believe he was doing this, but maybe, just maybe, she really would shut up and keep out of his hair while he finished these last few pages. Sit in a corner and shut up. Invisible. For that he'd feed her for the next couple of weeks until the supply boat came. 

He walked back and she was on her hands and knees, waiting where he'd left her. Naked, and trembling. He put the bowls in front of her, along with a couple of Tylenol, and she waited patiently. No longer whimpering. He brushed her hair back so he could see her face. She looked up at him, eyes big, pleading. "Eat." 

She leaned down, pressing her face into the bowl. Quiet except for the sound of her eating. 

He grabbed an afghan off the couch, and laid it on the floor by the door. "Your bed. I hear one God damn word from you, and I swear I will throw you out the door, and never give you one more fucking thing. You interrupt me again, and I'll beat the living daylights out of you." 

She looked up at him, and nodded. Lowering her face back to her food. 

Hunter turned his back to her, returning to his work. He managed to finish three pages before he even thought about her again. He was writing, no writer's block, the words flowing easily. He looked over, and she was lying on her side, dead to the world. She would still tremble uncontrollably every minute or so. 

He picked up the empty food bowl. She'd licked it clean. He took both bowls to the sink, washing the stew bowl and refilling the water. He placed the bowl back in its place beside her. He reached out and brushed her hair back. Her cheeks under her eyes were blistering, and her lips were cracked and raw. 

Why couldn't women always be like this? Hunter went to his closet and got a light blanket and covered her. 

He returned to his writing, his fingers dashing over the keys, his words taking form as fast as he could think them. 

* * * 

Amy lay where she'd been told, watching him. He was silent, focused, his fingers blistering the keyboard. She didn't know people could type that fast. 

She had to pee. It was becoming painful. She didn't know what to do. Would she anger him if she asked to go? Should she just get up and find the bathroom. Maybe she could slink outside unseen. She couldn't anger him. He was calm now. He'd fed her, and covered her. Obviously he had work to do, and she'd been interrupting. He had to stop some time. Stop for dinner. She could hold out a little longer. She had to. 

She watched him. Waiting. He had to take a break. 

Amy had her hands between her legs, pressing down. She couldn't wait much longer. It hurt so bad. Enough to distract her from the myriad other pains. She heard the sound of his chair legs scratching against the floor. He backed away from the laptop, closing the top, stretching. It was getting dark outside; he must have typed for six or seven hours without stopping. 

He stood, and turned toward her. She trembled at his approach. He squatted down beside her, and ran his hand across her hair. "Good girl," he said softly. 

Amy looked up at him. "I have to pee," she said softly, eyes downcast. 

She waited for the explosion. A slap, a kick something. When nothing happened, she looked up into his thoughtful face. 

"Sit." He said sharply. He extended his arm toward her and she flinched before he snapped it up in a 90% angle. "Sit!" he commanded, doing the gesture again. 

Amy sat back on her haunches, in pain, knowing she'd be leaking on his floor at any moment. 

"Good girl," he said, caressing her hair. "If you need to speak to me, approach my feet, sit and whine. I may allow it then." 

She scooted forward, curling her arms back, elbows tucked in, hands curled in front of her neck. She whined piteously. 

"Speak, girl." 

"Please, I have to pee. Now." 

He stood and opened the door. She crawled outside. Why couldn't he at least let me use the bathroom? Was that so difficult? 

* * * 

She might not be such a problem, Hunter thought. If she'd stay out from underfoot, out of his way. Ignorant little brat. He smiled, thinking how much she must hate being treated as a dog. He imagined his ex-wife, naked on her hands and needs, begging for any little treat. Forced to sleep outside at night. At his complete and total mercy for all her needs. Her and that bitch of a lawyer. Wouldn't that be justice? 

He allowed his puppy back in the house when she scratched at the door. She moved slowly, crawling into the house. Silent, obedient, cringing. She curled up back into her blankets, and he knelt beside her, checking her fever. She seemed to be doing better. 

Ignoring her, he went to the kitchen and prepared a simple meal. Spaghetti and clam-sauce, from his dwindling supply. He really needed to do some fishing, take some of the burden off his larder, if he'd have to be feeding her as well. 

He sat, eating his meal, keeping an eye on her. She was watching his every move. Probably starving. It wouldn't hurt her to suffer a little. Not like he hadn't been made to suffer for ages. 

When he finished his meal, he scraped the leftovers into a bowl for her, and put it on the floor at the end of the kitchen counter. He whistled and called her over. "C'mere girl. Feeding time." 

She was more tentative in her movements, taking an eternity to crawl across the hard floor, before she buried her face in the bowl. She glanced up at him a couple of times. He expected to see anger, but was greeted by a look of shame and maybe, gratefulness? 

Hunter retrieved her water bowl from the entrance corner, rinsed it out, and refreshed it. He set it beside her, brushing her hair out of the way and patting her head. "Hungry, girl?" 

She looked up and nodded, the sauce caking her lower face. She didn't seem to worry about it, as she dipped her mouth into the watering bowl, drinking deeply. While she finished her meal, he went to her corner and straightened out her blankets. A few moments in his orderly supply room, and he retrieved an old quilt, which he folded and placed on the floor, piling her blankets on top of it. A little extra padding for the puppy. 

When she'd finished licking her bowl clean, he took up the food bowl and placed it in the sink. He used his dish cloth to wipe her face, checking her temperature again. She seemed warm. He finished his cleaning, and noticed that she'd returned to her corner. So she was trainable. 

He sat on his couch, doing a little reading, the intruder in his home breaking his concentration several times. It had been a long day, and he decided to end it early. He checked on his puppy, and fed her a couple of more Tylenol, to take care of any fever. He pulled her blanket over her, and retreated to his room. 

For the first time, he wished he had locks on his interior doors. He wasn't sure he could trust her alone. What if she came into his room while he was sleeping? There's no telling what a woman may do. Deceitful, tricky, evil creatures. He settled for propping a chair against the door, counting on it waking him up if she tried to get in. 

* * * 

Amy was in a daze, lying in her blankets. He'd fed her. Watered her. Given her medicine. It might not be the Ritz, but she may survive after all. She'd waited for one of his outbursts, wondering if he'd cuff her, smack her around. Maybe take advantage of her. Instead, he acted as if she didn't exist, except for that brief feeding, and preparing her bed for her. She smiled briefly at the thought of his getting a new blanket for her to lie on. Was that a crack in his cruel demeanor? A momentary act of consideration? 

Why couldn't he give her something to wear? Let her out of the corner. She would have liked to lie on that couch, but she knew he wouldn't allow that. No, she had to be invisible, keep his attention at a careful distance. Go along with his asinine treatment of her. It wasn't that high a price for food and shelter, for survival. 

Her joints ached, her knees were tortured. Any time she moved, she felt the rough blanket scraping like sandpaper against her sensitive skin. 

She closed her eyes, wondering how long it would go on. He must have access to civilization. His food, medicine had to come from somewhere. How long would she have to be his dog, before some kind of rescue came for her, or he set her free? People had to be searching for her. How hard could it be to track down where she'd landed? 

Days, weeks, months? What kind of time-frame was she looking at? How long would he be willing to care for her? What if he snapped? She'd have to be good, a good dog. If he kicked her out, she knew that her days were numbered. She would be a good dog. The best. Her survival depended on it. 

* * * 

She woke to the smell of cooking. The clatter of a bowl on the kitchen floor had her struggling to free herself from the blankets, crawling across the floor. Steam was still rising from the scrambled eggs in her bowl. She made her way to her food, eating carefully so as not to burn herself. Her water bowl was refilled, and she drank deeply. 

She didn't feel well, and knew her fever had returned. Her bladder was full. She needed out. 

The man knelt beside her, opening his palm and holding out a couple of the painkillers. She picked them up with her lips, and drank from her water bowl. She almost wished there was a way to thank him for that little kindness. A hot breakfast and medicine. 

He reached for her bowl, and for a moment she considered pushing his hand away. There were still a few remains in there which she'd happily retrieve. She didn't get the chance. She backed away, and recalled his discussion about how to ask for something. She really needed to pee. 

She turned to him, but he was already gone. She found him by the door, holding it open. "Out. Out girl." 

Amy crawled toward him and he picked up one of her blankets, throwing it outside. "Don't be scratching at the door. I'll let you in when I'm ready." 

She nodded fearfully, hearing the door close behind her. She considered standing, walking down to the sand to pee, but she was afraid. Afraid he'd punish her, if she didn't maintain her role. That, and fearful of the pain in her feet, which were on fire. Her knees hurt terribly, but nothing like the agony she experienced when the soles of her feet touched anything. She felt shame squatting in the sand emptying her bladder. 

She rinsed off under the faucet at the base of the stairs. She could already feel the relentless fury of the sun beating down on her. She returned to the porch, scanning the area. She couldn't stay under the direct rays of the sun, nor did she want to leave the porch, in case he came for her. She decided to prop two of the lounge chairs against the porch railing. She laid her blanket out underneath them, and curled up there, under the shade from the railing and the chairs. It blocked 90% of the sun's light, and if she moved every so often, she could avoid the discomfort of the rays frying her skin. 

She napped restlessly, drinking from the porch faucet when thirsty, then retreating to her mini-oasis of shade. Why had he put her out? Hadn't she been good? What had she done wrong? Not subservient enough? Not grateful? 

These thoughts were echoing in her brain, when she heard the door open. She crawled out from her retreat, already on her way, when she heard his whistle. "C'mere girl!" he called out, and she turned the corner of the recessed entry, moving as quickly as she could, before he could change his mind. 

Grateful. She could be grateful. She brushed against his leg as she passed him, turning and rubbing her head against his thigh. She braced herself, then opened her lips and licked his skin. Grateful. I can play grateful. 

* * * 

Hunter had watched her from the door, as she crawled to the edge of the deck. She stood and walked down the steps, gingerly, turning at the bottom, squatting and peeing in the sand. He chuckled. She really had to go. He could hear the noise of her stream from where he stood. She stayed that way for a long time, before she walked over to the foot wash. An odd little bow-legged walk, until he realized she was trying to move on the sides of her feet. She turned on the faucet, refilling the low trough, and splashed the water up between her legs, then washed her feet. 

She was a good girl. Quiet when told. Quick to learn. Neat. Cleaned up after herself. 

She had built herself a little shelter, lazily napping underneath it. At least she wasn't bothering him. He'd managed to spend a few hours working, only minimally distracted, peeking out at her on occasion. When he looked up at the clock it was after one. Time for lunch. Time to feed the puppy. 

Opening the door a crack, he saw her respond to the sound. He watched her stretch, flaunting her body at him. He felt the anger build for a moment, then melt away when she got back on her hands and knees, crawling his way. He opened the door wide, whistling for her. "Come here, girl," he called out. 

She picked up her pace, crawling quickly. That must have been painful. At the door she rubbed her head against his leg. 

Hunter laughed, rubbing her head. "Heel," he said, snapping his fingers as he brought his arm down to his side swiftly, slapping his thigh. He walked into the living room, the girl following, one step back, and to his side. He walked over to the couch, lifted his hand over the cushion. Snapped his fingers. "Up!" She climbed onto the couch curling up. 

He looked her over, walking around her, her big blue eyes following him. She was in bad shape. He'd need to take care of her, if she was going to be there for a while. He tilted her head up and looked into her face. The burn was bad. He held his hand to her head. She was burning up. He was surprised she was able to be as obedient as she was. She should have been passed out and delirious. He checked her hands, her knees, her feet. 

"Stay," he told her arm extended, palm facing her. "Stay," he repeated. He retreated to the bathroom to get supplies. 

* * * 

Food and sleep. That's what I need. Something for the fever would be good. Anything for the pain. She had been nervous when he'd touched her, looking at her body. What was he going to do to her? Would she fight it? Could she? 

He walked back into the room, a bag of supplies in hand. He was bare chested, wearing only a pair of tight cut off jeans. She was surprised by the muscularity of his chest. He placed the bag on the floor beside her. He went to the kitchen and returned with a large glass of orange juice. She felt her mouth filling with saliva in anticipation. He sat on the edge of the couch in front of her. He held out some pills. "Open," he said softly. She opened her mouth, extending her tongue. He put the pills on her tongue and passed her the juice. "Drink as much as you can." 

She eagerly drank half of it, the tangy sweetness giving her goosebumps. She took a breath and drank the rest more slowly, passing him the empty glass. He smiled, and rubbed her head. Funny, he never touched her anywhere else, except for those few moments he checked her hands, feet and knees. 

"You are a good girl, aren't you?" 

Amy nodded. She whined softly, hoping that nodding was permissible. 

"Lay back now. Let me take care of you. This may hurt a little." 

She uncurled, stretching out a bit, closing her eyes. She hoped and prayed that 'taking care of her' wasn't some perverted euphemism. Not that she would fight it. She couldn't. 

He took her hand in his, and opened it up in his lap. He wiped it with a wet wipe, then produced some tweezers. She felt his gentle touch as he removed a couple of splinters she hadn't even realized were there. He did the same for her other hand. Amy whimpered a bit, when he had to dig under the skin. He reached out and brushed her shoulder. "Shh, I know it hurts. I'm sorry." He dabbed some hydrogen peroxide on the worst of the scrapes. It burned for a moment. He extended her arms, and checked and treated her elbows and forearms. 

He moved down by her knees, and wiped them clean. They were bruised and scraped, rubbed raw, sand embedded in her skin. He took his time with her, cleaning and wiping. When he was satisfied with the job he'd done there, he moved down the couch, dragging his supplies with him. He sat on the end and pulled her feet into his lap. He clucked over the shape they were in. 

"This is bad. You can cry or moan if you need to. I'll try to be gentle." 

Amy was astounded that even for that short moment he talked to her like a person. He had some small scissors and was cutting away the torn strips of flesh. She muttered a soft 'Ow' tensing up immediately. "That's Ok," he told her, reaching out and petting her thigh for a moment. He took a long time with her feet, cleaning out the sand, disinfecting. He cleaned between her toes, even trimming her nails. 

He got up. "Stay," he commanded. 

Like I'm going to go anywhere. 

She heard him running the water for a bath. The idea made her twitch. God, please, let that be for me. 

He walked back out, standing over her. "I need to bandage those feet, and we've gotta get some ointment on those burns, but we have to clean you up first. You're filthy. Don't fight me on this." 

She looked up and nodded softly. Fight you? I'd beg if it would help. 

She whimpered when he slid his arms underneath her, lifting her easily. His biceps looked like corded steel, bulging. He was strong, good thing she hadn't tried to fight him. He carried her into the bathroom, knelt and lowered her into the hot water, slowly. The heat made all her cuts, scrapes and contusions burn. She whimpered again. "I know. It'll be better soon. Trust me, puppy. I'm going to take care of you." 

He had a facecloth in his hand, and put some liquid soap on it. Amy leaned back, closing her eyes. 

* * *  

===

Hunter looked down at the poor creature. She was a brave little thing. That had to hurt. She hardly whined at all. He started at her neck, washing her as gently as he could, cleaning off the sand, salt and dirt. She smelled bad, stinking up his house. This would help. 

She would make the occasional groan or whimper when he hit the worst spots, but she didn't complain. He looked at her breasts, big tits, only purpose in life was to snare helpless weak men. She was built for temptation. He squeezed them roughly and she whimpered, looking up at him piteously. He looked down and saw the skin was scraped raw, her nipples bruised. Dragging herself across the sand and wood, probably. He looked closer and saw another splinter. "Stay," he said softly. 

He got his tweezers and returned to her, lying in the water obediently. He lifted her breast, and removed the embedded sliver of wood. He saw her nipple harden. Of course. Sluts. Slaves to their hormones. 

He retrieved his facecloth and took his time cleaning her thoroughly. He felt some anger when he reached between her legs, but she whimpered softly, opening her legs, and turning her face away. Not her fault she was dirty there. She was filthy everywhere. He was especially careful with her tortured feet, cleaning her ankles and between her toes, but leaving the soles alone, hoping the soaking helped. 

"Roll over," he told her. 

She did, obediently, quickly and carefully. She had difficulty keeping her head above water, and he opened the drain. He started with her back, and cleaned her thoroughly, gently. Her sunburn was much worse on her back. He wondered how she'd been able to lie on the couch without crying. She was blistering between her shoulders, and her bottom was a bright red, where her bathing suit had once covered her. 

He stopped the water from draining when there were only a few inches remaining. Fewer cuts and scratches on her backside, thankfully. He turned the water back on, checking the temperature, then slid her forward in the tub until her head was under the running stream. He washed her hair, taking a long time, getting the seeming endless quantity of sand out. He shampooed her long blonde tresses twice. 

Hunter debated cutting them. They were more trouble than they were worth. Yet they seemed to fit her. He'd leave it alone for now. 

When he was happy with her cleanliness, he lifted her out of the tub and sat her on the counter. He handled her carefully, patting her dry. He toweled her hair dry, and moved her legs, opening the door underneath her, searching until he found the blow-dryer he knew he had but so seldom used. A major drain on his power. 

Hunter plugged it in, drying her hair, running his fingers through it, removing the knots and tangles. She was brave, stoically sitting through the ordeal. He brushed her hair, carefully avoiding scraping her scalp. When the brush moved smoothly without resistance he turned off the blow-dryer, and lifted her. 

She leaned against his chest, rubbing her head against his shoulder. He almost dropped her when she licked his shoulder. 

He turned to the back of the house, opening the door into his bedroom. She whimpered, squirming in his arms, obviously frightened. "Stop," he warned her. "You need healing. I have no interest in your scrawny, salacious body. Be good, or I'll throw you back outside and let you fend for yourself." 

* * * 

Amy's heart had leapt in her chest. She knew it. The bedroom. He would use her and there was nothing she could do about it. She found herself twisting unconsciously, squirming in his arms. Please don't do this. Not now. Please. Let me rest first. Let me sleep. Let the pain go away. 

He snapped at her, commanding her to stop, letting her know that he had no interest in her as a woman. She was only his pet. He'd take care of her only as long as she was a meek, obedient, puppy. 

She could do that. As long as she needed, until she healed and rescue came. It wasn't that onerous. He had been gentle with her, although she could use another feeding. 

He placed her on the bed, carefully. "Roll Over," he commanded. Another silly gesture, as if she didn't know what roll over meant. She was happy enough to get off her back. The pain was constant, throbbing, itching. 

She sighed, embarrassed at her own ability to stay in her role, as the cool ointment was rubbed into her shoulders. Within moments the pain diminished. She felt his big firm hands move over her skin, missing no part of her. He paid more attention to her ass then he probably should, but as the pain down there faded, she realized how burned the soft white flesh on her rear must have been. He worked all the way to her ankles, and then did it all over again. She was half-asleep by the time he finished, relaxed for the first time in days. 

He caressed her head. "Good girl. Such a good girl. Roll over now." 

She was embarrassed. Naked on his bed, completely exposed. Amy rolled over, her hands briefly moving to cover her breasts. She saw that dark look again, the scary one, and moved her arms to the sides. His eyes softened. "Don't be afraid, puppy-girl, I won't hurt you. Your breasts do nothing for me." 

She whined softly, reaching out and brushing his leg with her hand. 

"Relax. Sleep if you can." 

He poured the lotion in his hands, starting at her shoulders and doing each of her arms, before moving down her chest. She felt herself blushing, embarrassed, as her nipples hardened. He covered her breasts carefully, his hands soothing. He worked down her body, stealing the pain, leaving comfort in his wake. He opened her legs, and she almost died, knowing he'd be able to see her involuntary reaction. He rubbed her pubis, and her throbbing pussy, gently, with no more attention than he'd given her elbows. Less. He continued down her legs, coating her thighs, inside and out, covering her knees and shins, finishing with her feet. Just as he had on her back, he traversed her body a second time and she relaxed totally. The excitement waned, exhaustion taking its place. She could barely keep her eyes open. 

"Good girl," he whispered, caressing her body from head to toe. She woke when she felt his hands brushing her hair back, gently rubbing her face. She closed her eyes again, his thumbs rubbing the cooling ointment into her cheeks, across her forehead. 

She looked up at him, surprised to see a tenderness in his visage. He wiped his hands carefully, then rubbed Vaseline into her lips, thoroughly, paying special attention to the sides of her mouth, where they met. 

"I'm going to take care of your feet now. I'll apply a light bandage, and change it in the morning. If it hurts too much, let me know." 

She nodded, mutely. 

He left her, returning with his first aid kit. 

"Naughty girl, letting your feet get like this. You'll have to take better care of yourself. I can't spend all my time pampering and bathing you." 

He was applying some disinfectant ointment that stung. She twitched, her legs trembling in spite of her effort. 

"It's Ok, girl. Don't fight it. If it hurts, you can let it out." 

She whimpered a couple of times, even whispering 'Ow' when he took care of the worst of it. 

He bandaged her gently. "What will I call you, girl? Speak." 

"Amy," she said softly. 

A grimace appeared on his face. Amy. He'd known a Amy. One of the bitch's best friends. Another traitor and useless cunt. "No," he snapped. "You're not an Amy. You ... you're a ..." Hunter was stuck. He didn't know what to call her, but it certainly wouldn't be Amy. He looked her over, taking in her sorry appearance, her sunburned skin— 

"Red. I'll call you Red." 

She lowered her head, and whimpered softly, fearful of his displeasure. 

He saw her response. She thought he was angry. He put his hand on her leg, stroking her softly. "Red was a good girl. A very good girl. Master's very proud of her. Are you hungry, or do you want to sleep?" 

"Hungry, Master. Please." She kept her voice low and soft, which seemed to satisfy him. 

"Rest. I'll bring you something." He sat beside her, his hand caressing her side, rubbing her belly softly. "Normally, puppies don't sleep on Master's bed. They certainly aren't fed from the table. This is just for tonight. Understood?" 

"Yes, Master. Thank you." 

Amy woke when she felt her shoulders lifted. Master held her up, sitting behind her, letting her rest against his chest. Her body was covered with a sheet, cool against her burning skin. He lifted a piece of meat to her lips and she ate it, gratefully. It was juicy, tender, spicy. "Mmm." 

He laughed softly. "I thought you might like that." He fed her another piece, then a french fry, hot, crispy, salty. It tasted homemade. She sighed leaning back into him, opening her mouth for her next treat. 

A bite of asparagus, firm, slightly crunchy on the stalk, not boiled to death. Buttery. He fed her the rest of the stalk before she got another piece of the delicious meat. When she'd finished her small meal, he wiped her mouth carefully, looking into her face. She giggled and gave a little bark. 

He laughed. "What? Still hungry?" 

She shook her head, wriggling. She barked again. Short, high pitched eager. She looked over at the tray. Where a piece of chocolate cake stood, begging to be eaten. She smiled, opened her mouth, panting eagerly. "Rowf!" 

She felt the chuckle in his chest. He broke off a piece, and fed it to her, sliding it between her lips. 

Amy had died and gone to heaven. Deep, dark rich chocolate. Smooth and creamy. She opened her lips eagerly for another piece. Bite by bite, she finished her treat, until nothing remained but a few crumbs. Delicious looking crumbs. She looked over and barked again. "Rowf!" 

"Greedy girl. You must be feeling a little better." He dragged his finger across the plate, capturing the last few crumbs. He put his finger in her mouth and she sucked it clean of all the chocolaty goodness. He pulled it out of her mouth and offered her another finger, and then his thumb. 

He brushed her hair with his fingers, rubbing his face against it. "You've had a long hard day, puppy-girl. If you need to get up to use the bathroom, you can go inside, for tonight. I don't want you walking on those feet, understand?" 

She nodded, rubbing her head against his hands. She felt his fingers scratching at her scalp, down the back of her head. 

He eased out from under her. "Roll over, Red." 

It took her a moment to associate her knew name with who she was. Once she did, she rolled over onto her stomach carefully. He lotioned her back, top to bottom, gentle but thorough. "Roll over," he said softly. 

She rolled onto her back, her energy dissipating, the exhaustion catching up with her again. "Poor tired puppy-girl. Sleep now." 

She closed her eyes, relaxing as his hands traversed her body. They felt amazingly good, comforting. She opened her legs for him, working to stay calm as he stroked his firm hand over her weeping pussy. She was only a little surprised when he rubbed her there a few times, before moving onward. 

* * * 

Hunter cleaned up the bedroom, bathroom and kitchen, putting away the first aid gear. He placed a tall glass of water and some more Tylenol beside it. 

He locked up, turning off the lights. He was still restless. It had been such an extraordinary day. He hadn't been that productive writing in ages. He was not only caught up, but ahead. He wasn't about to slack off; when the Muse made her presence felt, you chained the bitch down and wrung everything out of her you could. 

He wanted to do something for his puppy-girl. You reward them when they're good, and she'd been very good. He went to his closet and got some materials out, before retreating to his work area beside the study. When he was happy with his efforts, he took a brief shower, cleaned up, stripped down and climbed in his bed. He couldn't resist reaching out and stroking her soft hair. Such a good girl. 

Hunter awoke in the night, the girl beside him moaning and restless. He checked his clock. It was after 4:00. The painkillers were most likely wearing off. He felt her forehead, and found it feverish. He climbed out of the bed, and woke her gently. "Red, girl, wake up." 

She took a few moments to come to her senses. She looked up at him and pulled back, covering herself nervously. He waited patiently, until she relaxed. "Time for your medicine." 

She sat up, and he held the pills in front of her. She opened her mouth, extending her tongue, and he placed two pills on it. He passed her the water, and she drank half of it passing it back to him. She looked anxious, and she got on her knees, lifting her paws in supplication. "Rowf?" she barked softly. 

"Speak, puppy-girl." 

"Pee," she said softly. 

He pulled the sheet off of her, picked her up and carried her to the bathroom. He sat her on the toilet, and turned away, giving her privacy until he heard the flush of the toilet. 

He picked her up again, holding her close, nuzzling her hair while she licked his chest. He held her in one arm while he straightened the sheets, laying her on top of them. "Roll over." 

She rolled onto her belly, and whimpered sweetly while he lotioned her back, paying extra attention to her badly burned bottom. "Roll over." 

She rolled onto her back, opening her arms and legs. He took care of her again, not neglecting her breasts, and making sure she was well coated between her legs. Her nipples stayed calm, and her pussy didn't seem to be excessively wet. "Good girl," he told her. 

He lifted her, and pulled the sheet back, slipping her between them. 

Hunter got back into the bed, lying beside her, stroking her hair for a long time before he fell back asleep. 

* * * 

He didn't want her. Not like that. She wasn't sure whether she should be relieved or pissed off. He'd touched her all over, spending more time on her tits, and ass, even more between her legs. Touched her like nobody had before. Yet he'd never gotten hard for her. 

She'd almost freaked out when he woke her, standing naked next to the bed. She knew it had to happen eventually. She was attractive. She'd heard it often enough. For some reason being pretty but not putting out made you an immediate tease. She never led guys on, but that didn't seem to matter. Her looks alone were a tease, apparently. Men wanted her. 

He hadn't. He'd medicated her, helped her to the bathroom, and rubbed her entire body, quite thoroughly. Maybe he was gay. That would explain a lot. 

Amy had liked the feeling of him caressing her hair, until his breathing slowed, deepening. 

She could do this. It wasn't that horrible. Some moments were even nice. The man could cook, that was for sure, and that cake was to die for. She hoped there was more of that. She'd be a good puppy-girl for another slice of that yummy decadence. 

She could feel the inclination of the mattress, sagging toward him. She scooted over, leaning against his side. He shifted and she was nervous he'd cuff her or snap at her. Instead he reached over sleepily and petted her shoulder and arm, endlessly until she drifted off. 

* * * 

Hunter woke, uncomfortable. Bothered by the weight against his side. He'd slept alone for three years, and the company in his bed was disturbing. 

He couldn't fault her. She was lying quietly, unmoving. She was turned away from him, only her back and rear-end making contact against his side. He reached out for her, feeling the warmth of her skin. She was still too hot, the Tylenol might be helping, but she had a lot to recover from. He turned toward her, stroking her soft hair. Quiet like this, almost innocent, he could appreciate having her there. If only they could stay like that when awake. 

Hunter leaned closer, smelling her hair. She shifted, moaning softly, and he felt her soft backside press against him. 

He was hard. 

He backed away from her quickly, angry with himself for letting the little demon in his bed, and for reacting to her. The girl rolled onto her back, her face pinched, a little groan escaping her lips. Shit. 

He scurried to the bathroom, relieving himself angrily, punishing his traitorous stiffness, trying to blot the vision of her from his head. 

Tricky little slut. Playing him. Making him want her like that. Damn whore. Like all the rest. He grunted as he came, leaning over the toilet, venting his balls for the first time in months. It had become less necessary as time went by. 

He caught his breath, calming himself. Just a few days. Have to keep her out from underfoot. She shouldn't need much more care. Time to allow nature to take its course. He could feed and water her, that was a reasonable thing to do. 

He walked out to the kitchen. The sun was up, and he felt better than he had expected to. He recalled holding his little puppy-girl, carrying her to the bed, her appreciative little tongue brushing against his chest. 

Again, Hunter found his thoughts wandering to unfamiliar places, distasteful to him. He was being too easy on her. That was it. He cooked some eggs and a can of spam. He ate two thirds of it, dumping the remaining in her feeding bowl. 

Time to pay the bills. 

He entered his bedroom, a little irritated that she slept, useless, while he prepared to work. Like his parasitic whore of a wife. He pulled on his shorts, and walked over to the side of the bed. He pulled the sheet off of her, gazing down. She was lying on her belly, and he caught his breath. Damn it. If anything she looked worse. Some of the blisters on her upper back had opened, suppurating. The red of her ass cheeks looked horrid, and he could see the wrinkles and tiny bubbles of skin poisoning there as well. It looked distinctly odd. Her entire back was burned badly, but the bright red of her bottom was different than the brownish red on the rest of her. 

Hunter went outside to the back porch, cutting off a few aloe plant leaves he had growing in planters beside his tiny garden. He chose the largest leaves, closest to the ground, mature and potent. He knew well what that kind of burn was like. When he'd first bought the property, he'd invested hundreds of hours repairing, improving and expanding the shack. He had burned horribly about a week in, working shirtless under a cloudy sky, thinking that his tan and the clouds would make it safe. He had taken to growing aloe plants after that. 

He returned to the bedroom, stopping for a cool wet facecloth on the way. He wiped her down, listening to her soft whimpers, as he cleaned the open wounds. He chose the largest of the leaves, slicing open the stalk, squeezing out the gel onto her shoulders. She shuddered, as he gently rubbed the plant's gift into her skin. 

He moved down to the round curves of her bottom, slicing the leaves several times to get enough gel to cover her skin, rubbing it in gently. He spread her cheeks, making sure he took care of the sensitive skin that never saw the light of day. 

She whimpered softly, moaning as he finished with her. He covered her up again, leaving her to heal, and got back to his writing. The blank page was calling. 

* * * 

Amy stretched, sighing. The sheet felt rough against her skin, irritating her sensitive flesh. The pain had changed, no longer one all-enveloping agony. Individual areas hurt, her shoulders, her butt, her breasts. Her feet were the worse, every time she brushed against the sheet or mattress, she felt a stabbing pain. 

She was alone in the room. She climbed off the bed, onto her hands and knees, the thought of putting any weight on her feet terrifying. She found her way to the bathroom, struggling onto the toilet, which she desperately needed. Amy washed her face, before finding his toothbrush, brushing her teeth carefully, then brushing her hair out. She had to be careful, her scalp was in agony, but when she was done, she was content with how she looked. Exploring his cabinet, she found some Vaseline which she applied to her cracked lips. She felt almost human, and giggled to herself. No time to be human. Back to being man's best friend.  

===

She crawled out to the living room, seeing her temporary master once again working at his computer. She could smell the cooked food, and found her bowl, cold scrambled eggs and some meat product. No gentle feeding of a 5-star dinner this time. She smiled, recalling lying in his arms, being fed the steak and incredible chocolate cake. 

She ate her breakfast, surprised at how hungry she still was. She drank from her bowl, wiping her face on her arm. She crawled around the room, examining her surroundings for a long while. The man ignored her. Apparently she didn't have to stay huddled in the corner all day. 

Since she didn't have to, it wasn't that bad, crawling to the corner, rolling up in the loose blankets, lying on her side, watching him type. She relaxed, stretching, feeling her injuries. She wondered what was for lunch. 

She daydreamed, remembering his gentle touch. Such a change from his behavior the first day. Feeding her, removing the splinters, washing her wounds, lotioning her body. His big strong hands holding her, moving her, soothing her. 

Rafe had been nice to her. Gave her compliments. He even claimed to love her. Then he tried to rape her, threw her into the ocean and abandoned her to die. This man had said he hated her, condemned her. But those were the words. Instead he took care of her, fed her, bathed her, tended her wounds, her burns. He was gentle with her, even when touching her in those places. 

Amy caressed her breasts, feeling her sore hard nipples, pulling on them gently. One hand strayed between her legs, rubbing herself softly, remembering how he'd felt. Gentle, undemanding, caring. 

She looked up at the clock. It was after noon, and he'd been working non-stop. She was trembling, her pain returning. She needed more of the painkillers. Hot food would be nice. Chocolate cake would be perfect. 

So focused. How can he do that? She was hesitant to interrupt him, but the fever and trembling were getting worse. 

She crawled over to him, brushing her head against his thigh, whining softly. 

He reached down and stroked her hair, rereading his work. She whined more needily, rubbing against him. She was shocked to see him smile at her, scratching the back of her head. "Potty?" he asked. "Go out?" 

She shook her head, resting her forehead against his hand, trembling. He reached out and pressed his palm against her forehead. He pushed back from the desk. "Let's take care of you, puppy-girl." 

He picked her up, his powerful arms holding her gently. She felt secure, safe. Strange. Naked in the arms of a man who seemed to hate all women, she was comforted. He took her back to the bed, sitting her down on his side of the bed. 

She chuckled. His side. Like she had her own side. She nuzzled his chest, her tongue reaching out, delivering a long slow lick of appreciation, as he released her. 

"Stay," he said softly. 

He left her, and she waited patiently for his return. He came back with juice and pills. She opened her mouth eagerly, accepting the medicine, and drank half the juice. She set the glass down, and leaned back. 

He brushed her hair back, stroking her. "Good girl. Wait here." 

He left her again, alone, in his bed. She curled up, anxious for his return. When he didn't come back after several minutes, she crawled off the bed, looking for him. 

She crawled up beside him, rubbing against his leg. 

He glanced down, a look of irritation painting his face. He picked her up again, giving her a shake. "Bad Girl. Bad Red!" He put her back on the bed. "Stay. Stay!" He extended his arm straight outward, palm forward, fingers pointing upward. "Stay!" 

She whined, lowering her head. He was mad. She should have waited. 

He returned a couple of minutes later, grilled ham and cheese sandwich and tomato soup on a tray. He put it on the table next to her, and climbed on the bed. She cowered, hoping he wasn't still mad. 

The man brought her to his chest, holding her. "Good girl, waiting for Master." He grabbed half a sandwich and held it to her cracked lips. She nibbled on it, eating it slowly. After half the sandwich, he lifted the soup and spooned it to her lips. She sipped. It was delicious, warm, smooth, lightly spiced. She hummed happily, letting him feed her. When he'd finished with the soup he fed her the rest of the sandwich, wiping her lips gently. She'd spilled a little on her chest, and he was careful and tender as he cleaned her up. 

Almost perfect. All it needed was a little of that cake. 

He got up, easing her back onto the bed. "Feet first, then we'll check out the rest of you. 

She almost giggled. No problem checking her out. Naked as the day she was born.

Hunter removed the bandages from her feet. They still looked bad but were healing nicely. He applied some more Neosporin, covering the soles again. He examined her knees, which were red, but mostly uninjured. The hard floor must have been difficult for her. He remembered his late night effort. In a bit. Let's get the poor thing taken care of first. 

He put his hand against her head. It felt like she still had a bit of a fever but not as bad. He'd take her temperature later. "Stay," he commanded, giving that palm outward gesture. Then he left her to get a few supplies, and some new aloe cuttings. 

He returned and she was obediently lying there, waiting. He knew she must still be uncomfortable, still in pain, but she waited quietly. He sat beside her, petting her head, then rubbing her belly. "Red's such a good girl. Waiting for Master. Good, good girl." 

She smiled, wiggling her bottom. 

The tray had a large Pyrex bowl of water on it, and he brought out a chamois and wet it. She was trembling, looking at it. He realized she was looking at the ice cubes in the bowl. 

"Red," he said softly. She whimpered, staring at the bowl. 

"Red, Watch me," he said, raising his hand to his forehead. She still cowered, trembling. It was only cold water; you'd think she'd be begging for it. 

He sighed. She still needed so much training. All puppies did. He didn't mind. There was something wonderful about your puppy learning a command, and obeying it. He was a firm believer in reward training for his dogs. He moved the tray out of her sight, and covered her up. "Stay, puppy-girl. Stay." 

It wasn't hard to guess what kind of treat would work for her. The way she'd acted up for the cake the night before. Cake was a treat for him as well. He tried to make it last, keeping it covered, on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator, where it was harder for him to get to and see. He pulled the cake tray out and opened it. One decent sized piece left. Hunter cut it in half and put away the rest. He divided it into little bites. Only eight, but that should do. 

He smiled to himself. She'd watch him now. 

* * * 

Amy was nervous, she hadn't meant to defy him but the idea of ice water on her skin was terrifying. She'd had the chills so bad, and now she was barely starting to warm up. Besides, who knows what he was going to do with that ice. She'd heard of some pretty weird stuff. 

He walked back into the room, and put a small plate on the table next to her. She couldn't see what was on it, some books in the way, but she was pretty sure she could smell it. She sniffed harder, leaning toward the plate, her mouth starting to water. 

Chocolate. No doubt about it. She smiled up at him. "Rowf!" she yipped. 

He laughed, pulling out a small bit of that chocolate cake. "Puppy treat. For a good puppy-girl." Her eyes were glued to the treat. As required. He lifted the treat to his forehead. "Watch!" he said. 

Amy sat up, eager for her treat. Little piece of chocolate heaven. He held the morsel between his fingers and brought it to her lips. She opened her mouth extending her tongue, and he placed the snack on it. She closed her mouth, then her eyes, letting the decadent morsel melt in her mouth. 

"Watch!" she heard. She looked up and followed his hand back up to his forehead. "Watch!" he repeated firmly, staring at her. She looked into his eyes, and he smiled, feeding her the treat she'd earned. She watched his hand go back to the plate, chocolaty morsel in his fingers. 

"Watch!" 

She looked up to his eyes, his other hand touching his forehead. He lowered the hand and then raised it sharply, his extended fingers just over his eyebrow. "Watch!" 

It would be hard not to, those piercing dark eyes, so intense. He blinked, looking down at her body for a second, and the spell was broken; she looked for the hand with the chocolate. Her chocolate. 

"Watch, Red!" he said, and she looked back into those dark, brooding eyes. 

He leaned forward and kissed her forehead. She could feel her body shiver, involuntarily. "Good puppy-girl," he cooed, pressing the chocolate to her lips, letting her lick them clean. He stroked her hair, and eased her onto her back, praising her. 

"Such a smart puppy-girl. Good puppy-girl. Good Red," he whispered to her, his hand caressing her side, rubbing her belly softly. He gave her another chocolate. She smiled, pressing against his side. He looked so happy. She hadn't even been sure he knew how to be happy. The hand rubbing her belly, settled over her little patch of hair, scratching it. She pressed against his hand, and he laughed, rubbing her playfully. "Puppy-girl, has so little fur. We'll have to keep this tiny bit." 

He brought his hand to his head. "Watch!" She looked up. "Watch ..." he repeated softly, locking her eyes. He held out the wet chamois. "This will be cool, Red. I'll be careful. I just want to bring your temperature down, Ok?" 

She nodded, whimpering. She knew the truth. Cool, meant ice-cold. 

He pushed her back down, and pressed the cloth to her arm. She braced herself and sighed, when she felt the cool relief. She whimpered. 

He leaned over her face, looking down at her. "Is it Ok? I don't want you to hurt any more, poor puppy-girl." 

She nodded, sad to feel the cloth removed. He wet it again, wrung it out, and pressed it on her upper chest. Cool, soothing, why had she not trusted him? Ever since he had let her in, he'd taken care of her. 

Amy sighed, relaxed, and let him take care of her again. 

* * * 

Hunter moved the chamois, wetting it and placing it across her chest. She was calmer now, settled down. Half asleep. He started with a second chamois, alternating the two, cooling her off, soothing her. He inspected her body, checking the healing, the small injuries. He knew that her front had taken more damage from the crawling she'd apparently done, while her back was burned much worse. 

Cute little puppy-girl, so quiet now. Rather than wake her and tell her to roll-over, he lifted her and did it himself. She woke a little, looking up at him and smiling with those big blue trusting puppy eyes. He set her on her belly, starting the cooling again. 

He was concerned, he could feel the heat radiating off her back, and the blistering had not reduced much. He didn't like draining any of the blisters if he didn't have to, but there were a few bad ones on her shoulders that looked like they needed care. 

She was sleeping soundly once he'd covered her small body twice with the chamois. She felt cooler, maybe a combination of the chamois, the drugs, and the rest. He retrieved his first aid kit, used the alcohol to sterilize his needle and some cotton balls, and set to work on the worst of her blisters. He lanced it carefully at the base, and drained it thoroughly, leaving the skin intact to speed the healing. She whimpered a little, waking up part way through the first one, but he was able to calm her down. 

She gave a little groan when he was working on the second one. It was ugly, a good inch or more across, and bubbling badly. She twitched under his hands and he tried to sooth her. "Good girl," he murmured softly, "my good little puppy- girl, so brave." 

She sighed, and relaxed. When he was done with her shoulders, he sat up and looked down at her. She was awake, watching him. He looked over at the three remaining treats on the plate. He took one in his hand and her eyes tracked it, smiling. 

He dropped to his knees beside the bed, bringing his face close to hers. "I'm so proud of my puppy-girl. You are so brave, so good." He kissed her cheek and she blushed. He lifted the treat to her lips and she opened her mouth. He fed her the tiny chocolaty square. "We're almost done. Are you still Ok, Red? Speak." 

She nodded. "Thank you," she breathed softly, lowering her eyes. "Master." 

He brushed her hair back, petting her. She rubbed her head against his hand, when he stopped for a moment, and he sat up, and continued petting her until she was calm again. He turned to her bottom, addressing the worst blister there, the size of a nickel. He drained a second smaller one after that, and inspected her again. None of the others seemed bad enough for concern. He'd let them heal naturally. 

He got out his soothing lotion, and worked her body gently, head to toe, pleased that she was so relaxed. Need to get more lotion. I'll use up a year's worth this week. Hunter looked down at her soft body, which had taken so much damage. A good puppy's worth it. 

He took the thermometer from his bag, shook it down, and put some Vaseline on the tip. He moved down to her waist and spread her cheeks. She whimpered softly when he eased the glass device into her bottom. "Easy, girl. I'm just taking your temperature," he told her, stroking the back of her thigh. 

He caressed her softly, waiting the requisite three minutes. A little over 100, not too bad. He saw a little Vaseline on the edge of her puckered opening, and he rubbed it in gently. "That wasn't too bad, was it? Your fever is almost completely gone." 

She rolled over sleepily, spreading her arms and legs. 

Hunter felt his anger returning. Playing innocent, then acting like a slut, he thought. He saw her looking to the side. Probably thinks she can earn another treat, by teasing me. Bitch. Like all the rest. 

She reached out and nudged the lotion, whimpering softly. 

His anger popped like a balloon. She still hurts. 

He felt guilty, something he hadn't allowed himself to do in years. He cleaned and put away the thermometer, and started the lotion. Arms and shoulders, neck, chest. The top of her breasts and upper chest was the worst on her front. That and her face. He coated her chest, rubbing her tits. Her breasts, he corrected himself. They were full and soft, still red on the tips from the abuse they'd taken. His big hands enveloped them, ensuring they were thoroughly covered. 

Not her fault they're like this, he thought, tenderly coating her nipples when they hardened. Sad, lost, little puppy-girl. 

* * * 

Amy was slipping in and out of consciousness. The pain was almost gone, she felt comfortable, not aching, for the first time in days. His hands on her chest felt soothing, not dirty. Not demanding. She took a deep breath, her chest swelling, and he squeezed her breasts, his slippery hands sliding around her skin. 

His hands moved down her body, strong and controlling, coating her sides, her belly. He continued south, covering her hips, and the insides of her thighs. He rubbed her bush, running his fingers through it, his fingertips scratching at her. It was nice, playful, caring. She wiggled her hips and heard his chuckle. "Puppy likes her belly rubbed," he teased. 

It was a little low for her belly, but she couldn't deny she liked it. His fingertips moved side to side, up and down, wherever there was hair. She felt his nails scratching her gently, and she tried to still herself when he moved lower, rubbing her little love button. He didn't seem to do it on purpose, and he didn't concentrate on it, but that brief touch woke her. 

He pushed her far knee outward, opening her up, and she whimpered again, when his slippery lotioned hand moved between her legs. 

"It's Ok, Red," he said softly. "I know you're not bad." 

She relaxed, her leg settling down onto the bed, as his hand rubbed her. She closed her eyes, sighing, while he thoroughly lotioned her there, his fingers gentle, opening her just a bit, the slippery smoothness coating her. 

She whined softly when his fingers left and continued down her legs. She heard his soft chuckle. 

When he'd finished with her toes, he started over again. She squirmed under his hands more than she wanted to, enjoying his touch, not wanting him to stop. He spent less time between her legs, only brushing across it a couple of times. 

Afterward he covered her with the sheet. "Sleep, puppy-girl. Sleep, and heal. I want you all better." His hand was running through her hair, and she opened her eyes a little. She turned her head, her mouth pressed against his wrist, and she licked him softly, kissing his warm skin. 

"Who's my favorite girl?" he said, running this thumb across her lips. 

"Woof," she barked softly. 

He laughed, leaning over and kissing her forehead. "That's right. Red is. Red's my favorite puppy in the whole world." 

She closed her eyes and relaxed, feeling him straighten the covers, and planting another kiss on her forehead. 

She woke, the room streaked with shafts of light from the setting sun. She crawled out of bed and went to look for him. Would he be writing? Cooking? Maybe something new? 

He was sitting on the couch reading. She crawled over and rested her chin on his knee, looking up at him. He reached down and petted her. "How's my puppy- girl?" he asked, his wicked fingers going to the nape of her hair, scratching her there, teasing. She turned and licked his leg. She could taste him, a salty, manly taste. She licked longer, slower. 

"Watch," he said. 

She looked up, into his eyes. 

"Does puppy-girl need to be let out?" he asked. 

She realized her bladder was full. She nodded. 

He patted the cushion, next to him, then snapped his fingers. "Up!" 

She climbed up on the couch, and sat, waiting for his next command. 

"Stay," he said softly, extending his hand. He walked away and returned only a few moments later. He piled some things at her feet, then lifted her and set her on her back. He was gentle. She looked up and waited patiently. 

He took her leg and bent it, her foot flat on the cushion. He put a pad on her knee, and pulled a Velcro snap across the back. It was soft against her skin, conforming to it. He pushed her leg down and she was vaguely aware her legs were spread wide open for him. Maybe he'd touch her. Pet her. 

He covered her other knee with a similar pad. "There," he said. "No more bruised knees for my puppy-girl. Try them out." 

She rolled off the couch onto her hands and knees. So much better. She crawled over to the hard surface of the kitchen tile, crawling around the island. No pain at all. She sat up smiling. "Rowf!" 

"You're welcome," he chuckled. "Come!" he snapped, and she crawled over quickly, stopping at his feet. She looked up at him from between his legs. He patted his thighs. "Up, girl." 

She hesitated a moment. He was only wearing shorts. Loose knit shorts. Was it now? Was he going to use her? She trembled. 

"Up, Red," he repeated, snapping his fingers, and patting his thighs. 

She hung her head and climbed onto his lap. He directed her knees outward, making her straddle him. Was it going to be like this? She felt his hand on her chin, tilting her head up. "Good girl," he whispered. His hands moved around her neck, and she felt a weight, contact, something choking her, briefly. He finished, running his fingers around her neck. "Too tight?" he asked. 

She twisted and turned her head. She was collared. Not too tightly, but not loose at all. She tested it again, then looked into his eyes shaking her head. 

"Good. I don't want my puppy getting lost." He pulled her against his chest, caressing her, while she calmed again. She leaned her head against his shoulder, and licked his neck softly.  

===

He stood, holding her, then put her down on the couch. He took her foot in his hand, examining it for a moment, and eased a slipper over it. The same for the other. "Walk for me, Red. Let me know if it hurts too much." 

She stood up carefully, her feet sensitive. She took a few tentative steps and found her feet, while still painful, weren't in agony. A few more paces, and she was walking carefully, without much pain. 

"Speak, girl. Tell me." 

She walked over to him. "It's good," she murmured. "Very little pain. Thank you." She hesitated a moment, lowering her eyes. "Master." 

He nodded. "Down, girl." 

She dropped to her hands and knees, moving closer and rubbing against his thigh. "Let's take you for a walk. In the house, you stay like this. Out in the sand you can walk, understood?" 

"Woof!" she barked, shaking, excited to get out of the house and walk around. 

He snapped a long rope leash to her collar, and walked to the door. She followed, at his heel. He moved slowly, letting her keep up. She watched him grab his rifle from the wall in the entry, slinging it over his shoulder, and she crawled after him, out the door. 

The sun was almost down, but the air felt warm and pleasant against her skin. She followed him down the wooden stairs, stepping over the foot bath. At the end of the wooden walk she stood, stretching, twisting her body carefully, feeling how her sun damaged skin responded. Her master waited for her patiently. 

* * * 

Hunter watched her stretching, her lithesome body teasing him. He tried to shake it off. It was no different than when she was on her hands and knees, or stretched out on the bed. Still, for some reason it didn't feel right. 

She turned to him and scurried over. She barked softly, moving around him, shuffling. She leaned against him, her cute little tongue licking his chest, his arms. Brief little lashes. She rubbed up against him, then walked away, tugging at her leash. 

He smiled, happy she was feeling better. Good to get out of the house. He'd been lax about his patrols. He wouldn't do the whole island now, she wasn't up to it, but he figured they could walk the couple of hundred yards of beach. 

He followed her, giving a gentle tug to slow her down. She scurried over to the tree-line, then squatted. She looked up at him anxiously as she loosed her bladder, a thin little stream becoming stronger, pooling at her feet. He stood near her, the leash loose, and waited. She stood and grinning at him, kicked some sand over her mess. 

They walked the waterline together, no tension on her leash. She'd stop occasionally to pick up a shell and look at it, before tossing it into the water. She turned and twisted, spinning around, looking so cute, so playful. Tangling up her leash. 

"Stay," he told her, standing over her, and unwrapping the rope from her neck and body. He made her raise her leg, so he could free it from her entanglement. 

No footsteps in the sand. No sign of intruders on his island. 

At the end of the beach he saw she was limping. She slowed down, and dropped to her knees, crawling slowly. 

Damn. Too much. I shouldn't have let her over do it. "Do your feet hurt?" he asked. 

She whimpered, nodding. 

"It'll be better soon," he said picking her up, cradling her in his arms. He had to be careful of her back; he didn't want to hurt her anymore. She cuddled into him, shivering. He lifted her and pressed her forehead against his cheek. She was hot again. He felt her lips press against his neck, her tiny tongue bathing him. 

Hunter stopped at the foot wash, rinsing both of their feet, as well as her hands and knees. She was trembling, and he knew her fever had returned. Carrying her into the bungalow, he set her gently on the couch. 

"Stay, girl," he growled softly, hand extended in command. 

She curled up, watching him anxiously. He grabbed a few Tylenol and a glass of water, returning to his charge. She opened her mouth obediently, and he set the pills on her tongue, then placed the glass at her lips, brushing her hair back from her face as she swallowed. 

"Good girl," he praised her softly, his hand running along her shoulder. Her eyes gazed up at him in trust. "Stay," he whispered. 

He started the tub, filling it with warm water, not too hot. Not today. His puppy needed another bath, and some more lotion treatment. She leaned her head against his chest as he lifted her easily, walking to the bathroom. "Puppy needs a bath, a little care and some rest. Let Master take care of you." 

She leaned back in the tub, the water only a few inches deep. Hunter checked the temperature, adjusting it minutely, before taking her feet in his hands, examining them. No further damage, fortunately. She wasn't back to health yet, not even close. He'd have to monitor her actions more carefully. Getting out in the fresh air, a chance to play around was good for the body and soul, but still too early for his puppy-girl. 

He grabbed a face cloth soaped it up lightly, and started washing her. Up her strong slender legs, firm beneath his touch. Along her thighs, gently between her legs. He lathered her belly, and saw her twitch. He looked up and saw she was smiling. Ticklish. An image burst in his mind of her lying at his feet, his hand scratching her soft belly, her leg kicking instinctively. 

He carefully continued, up her chest, under and around her breasts. Lifting her arm to get her pits, bathing each individually. She was good, patient, allowing him to move her without fighting. Leaning her back under the faucet, washing her hair out thoroughly, twice, before adding conditioner. Her eyes were closed much of the time, relaxed, peaceful. 

"Such a good girl, Red," he cooed, his fingers scraping her scalp. "Daddy's good girl. Best puppy in the world, she is." His voice changed register, praising her. 

A small smile appeared on her lips, and she moved her head, seeking his touch, placing her tender, sensitive areas under his strong fingers. 

"Other side now," he said softly, turning off the water, and letting it start to drain. 

He had to be careful. The burned flesh was still red, small blisters abundant, the larger, drained ones in danger of tearing. Gently, carefully, he bathed her, his hand ghosting across her skin, his touch feather light. "You'll be better soon, puppy-girl. Much better. Then we can go out and play." 

Satisfied with the job done, he lifted her out of the water, and sat her on the edge of the sink. He toweled her off carefully, drying her hair. "Feeling better?" he asked. 

She smiled, and yelped once. 

He lifted her, feeling her head snuggle into the hollow of his neck. He kissed the top of her head gently. "Let's get you taken care of, puppy-girl." 

Laying her on the bed, she moved to the side, so he could place a towel underneath her during the lotioning. Once it was in place, she rolled onto it carefully, lying on her belly. 

Hunter removed his shirt and shorts. He was soaked from bathing her. She watched him, but he didn't see the nervousness, the fear he'd spotted when the stray first followed him home. Her eyes, large and trusting, watched him remove his underwear, his manhood swollen, not fully erect, but hardly retreating. He slid on some knit shorts, and sat on the edge of the bed beside her. 

Once more his hands traced every inch of her young body, perhaps spending a few more seconds than necessary between her thighs, and taking care of her firm cheeks. It was clear she understood the need, didn't flinch or pull away. Didn't try to cover up. 

When he'd completed his first pass, he commanded her. "Over. Over, Red." 

She turned carefully, positioning her legs, feet spread shoulder-wide, arms straight and relaxed, palms up, maybe a foot from her hips. 

"Pretty puppy," he whispered, unaware of the words as they escaped his lips. 

Amy smiled at him, giving a little anticipatory wiggle. 

He was a little firmer with the front, no blisters, less of a burn, careful around the scrapes from her crawling, but otherwise, his hands were steady and controlling. He worked from head to toe, checking on her feet once again before moving upward again. He turned her legs outward one at a time, covering the inside of her thighs. When he reached the 'V' between her legs, he rubbed her firmly, lingering. 

"I know you're a good girl," he said to her softly. "Such a good girl." His finger slid down her parted lips, and he felt the slight moistness. Looking into her face, he saw a hint of nervousness. 

"Trust your Master, puppy-girl," he said. "I would never hurt you." 

The tenseness in her legs dissipated, knees bowing outward, opening. He added some more lotion, rubbing her swollen puffy flesh, his finger sliding slightly inside of her, penetrating for only a moment. His hand continued upward, rubbing her little fur patch. "My Red has the softest fur," he teased, his fingernails penetrating through the curly blonde hair, scratching her skin. Back up her belly, he paused over her breasts, examining the small scratches and pierced flesh where the splinters had been. 

"Getting better," he murmured. His hand cupped the tender flesh, kneading, rubbing, tugging on her nipples, getting them to rise. He chuckled. "Naughty puppy." 

Abruptly he realized what he was doing, and pulled his hands away quickly, listening to her soft, nervous whine. "You did nothing wrong, Red. You're a good girl. Such a good girl." He finished with her shoulders, and then a careful few moments with his fingers on her face, tracing her soft features. 

When he was done, he lifted her in his arms, her smell strong, the mixture of soap, lotion, and Red. Pulling the sheet back he set her down, covering her. "Rest now, puppy-girl. Rest, and when you wake, Master will give you a treat." He brushed his lips against her forehead. She closed her eyes, content. 

* * * 

Amy rested, her mind still active. Cataloging her injuries, and wondering at her own behavior. She could see what was happening to her, and was helpless to stop it, not even knowing if she wanted to. 

It was her puppy-mind, she told herself. When her puppy-mind took over, she was happy. Free from complex thought, acting and responding to his actions, eager for his touch, anxious for his praise. There was nothing wrong with rubbing against him, her tongue seeking his flesh, his touch familiar and needed. His strong hands caressing her skin, free to do whatever he wanted. Controlling, protecting, appreciative. Caring. 

Alone, particularly in the bed, her thoughts would revert to normal. How long before she'd be free? Were they searching for her even now? What had happened after she fell overboard? Surely Rafe told somebody. They must have looked for her, although it would have been a daunting task with the strong currents, in the dark of night. Still, would they find this island? Were search teams out now? Did her parents know of her disappearance? She started to get nervous, feeling the stretch of her healing skin, the pain of her feet, the constant discomfort where the sheets pressed against her skin. 

A treat. He'd promised her a treat. Chocolate? Something yummy? She'd been a good girl. Good puppy. She'd earned it. She relaxed, imagining the chocolaty goodness between her lips, Master's hand rubbing her mouth, directing any loose crumbs back between her lips. Holding her, keeping her fed. Spoiling her. She was a good girl. She deserved a treat. 

* * * 

Amy woke, disoriented, the bed she was on tilting. She scrambled for a moment until his hand settled on her upper arm, gently. "Shhh, Red, it's Ok," the deep voice reassured her. 

She looked up into his concerned face, and his hand rested on her forehead. "Your fever's back," he said. 

"Cold," she mumbled, her body shivering. 

Hunter pulled the covers up over her, then pressed a couple of pills against her lips. "Open up, girl. It'll help." 

She parted her dry cracked lips, and he slipped the medicine into her mouth. His powerful arm slid under her shoulders and lifted her easily, his other hand holding a glass of water to her lips. "Drink." 

She swallowed, her mind still fuzzy. She knew the man. He was a little scary but she felt safe with him. When he lowered her back onto the mattress, she curled up, trying to stop the shivering. When the man climbed into the bed with her, she felt no fear, only comfort as his body curled around hers, his warmth and strength reassuring. 

"Shhh, Red," he whispered, his hand brushing her hair back, his lips breathing into her ear. "It's Ok, you're going to be fine." 

She clutched his arm to her chest, leaning back against him, secure for the moment. She remembered dreaming, a nightmare. She had been drowning, and a boat-full of people had drifted nearby, laughing at her. She'd swim toward the ladder, but every time she got close, hands would push her under the water, and when she resurfaced, the boat was out of reach. She'd swim toward it again, kicking free of unseen submerged hands reaching for her, touching her, grabbing her legs, her breasts. It was hopeless. 

"Drowning ..." she murmured, the fear that had left her breathing ragged no longer the only thing in the world. 

"Never, puppy-girl. Not as long as you're mine," he told her, holding her firmly. 

Amy sighed, kicking and maneuvering her legs, until they were entwined with his. She leaned her head back, and his arm slipped underneath it, warm, smelling of him. She turned her face, kissing his bicep, feeling the muscle twitch. Her tongue reached out to lick it, tasting him. He adjusted his position and she whimpered softly when the pain of the skin on her shoulders and bottom was exasperated by the movement. 

"Sorry," he told her. "Relax, Red. I'm here. I've got you. You're safe, puppy- girl." 

Puppy-girl. She smiled, giving a contented "Woof." Master was here. She was safe now. He'd take care of her. She was a good puppy. 

She heard his chuckle. "Best puppy in the world," he whispered. "Master's good little puppy-girl. Master loves his puppy." 

She whined softly, tugging his arm closer, clinging to it. Her breathing settled, and her shivering stopped. Safe. She was safe. 

* * * 

Hunter had been concerned, seeing her struggling in the sheets, all twisted, crying, whining. He'd put down the medicine and hot-chocolate he'd made for her, and sat on the edge of the bed, freeing her from the entanglement of the sheets. She'd fought him pulling away, then reaching out, her fingers hooked into claws. 

He was able to calm her down, and get the Tylenol in her. The hot-chocolate treat would have to wait. It was late and she needed the rest. More time for healing. Hunter climbed into the bed with her, huddling around her curled up body, the trembling causing concern. He pulled her in close, her mumbling barely audible. 

"It's Ok, I'm here," he tried to reassure her. "You're safe now, puppy-girl." 

Her barely audible response was a contented "Woof." 

It made him smile. He tried to adjust, but she was clinging to the arm held against her chest, her legs and feet tangling with his, squeezing them. She was a good girl. Good puppy. The best. He told her so. 

She settled down, and he pulled her even closer. Her soft skin pressed against his. The arms clinging to his forearm relaxed and he moved his hand, settling over her breast, holding it gently. So soft. Her head was pressed into the hollow of his neck, and he kissed her soft hair. 

His poor little girl. She had suffered. He wondered what had happened to her. Hunter remembered her initial comments, falling off a boat, swimming all night and day. How exhausted she'd been. He thought she'd been on drugs. He felt pangs of guilt for how he'd treated her. She hadn't done anything to him. She wasn't like the others. No viciousness, no cruelty. An innocent. 

"I'm sorry," he breathed into her ear. "I'll take care of you, puppy-girl. Nobody will hurt you now." 

He closed his eyes, his hand clutching her breast, his entire body curled around hers protectively. 

* * * 

Hunter woke to find Amy had turned toward him. He was on his back, and she was clutching him, holding on desperately. He felt her head, checking on her fever. Warm but no longer burning up. She'd partially kicked off the covers, and as he reached down to pull them back up, she whimpered, clinging. He soothed her, his words calming, his hands petting her gently. 

It was near dawn, a hint of light entering the room, allowing him to see her. See his good little puppy-girl. His hand stroked her skin lightly, feeling the dryness. She'd need more lotion. While his mind wandered, his hand continued to caress her, his face buried in her hair, filled with her scent. 

She shifted minutely, her hip moving, pressing against his erection. He felt a momentary burst of anger, which dissipated almost as quickly. It wasn't her fault. She was a good puppy, sleeping. Trusting. 

He tried to ignore his need, his hand running across her bottom, feeling the swell of her cheeks. Such a pretty puppy-girl. 

She turned, moaning in her sleep. He remembered the nightmare from earlier. "Easy, Red. I'm here. Master's here. You're safe. Master will take care of you." 

She sighed and cuddled in closer, relaxing. He twisted his hips, freeing his cock. That betraying part of his anatomy. He grasped it squeezing it sharply, willing it to go soft, to no avail. Instead, he started stroking it softly, while he held his innocent puppy-girl. He kissed the top of her head, breathing her scent, and allowed his other hand to touch her body, gently caressing her back, her perfect bottom. Perfect except for the abomination of her burn, but that would heal. He'd make sure of that. 

He would lotion her bottom, take care of her, tend her until the skin was whole again, smooth and perfect. 

The need overcame him suddenly, and he tried to stifle his moan as his cock erupted. The shame hit him hard, and he wriggled out from under his whimpering little puppy-girl. He made straight for the bathroom, cleaning up the evidence. While there, he thought about his perfect little puppy-girl. Such a good girl. He smiled as he thought about what he needed to make her an even better little puppy. 

* * * 

For the next couple of days, life went on. 

Hunter took care of his puppy's needs, feeding her, mostly from her bowl, occasionally from his hand when she was feeling bad. He lotioned her and bathed her, watchful of her blisters and peeling skin. 

She learned. She was curious, often sniffing around the house while he worked, but careful not to be too distracting. She spent much of her time curled up in the corner, sleeping as much as she could, letting nature work its miracle on her, letting her heal. 

Habits took form. Letting her out in the morning while he cooked breakfast. Letting her in and feeding her, giving her medicine. Allowing her the run of the house during the day, again letting her out before lunch, before calling her back for her meal. 

Red was a good girl. She removed her knee covers on her own, when leaving the house and before going to bed, putting them on herself, upon entering the house and when she got up in the morning. She'd even learned to come in from the rain, which it seemed to do almost every other day, scratching at the door before he let his bedraggled little puppy-girl in, and dried her off. 

Hunter had argued with himself, as she got better. Puppies shouldn't sleep on the bed, or climb on the furniture, but she was a good girl, and it was his own fault that he'd started her on the habit. The fifth night he'd left her on the floor, and she'd been obedient, whimpering softly from the corner, curled up in a miserable ball. When the nightmare started, and he'd seen her struggling, moaning, he'd immediately climbed out of bed to take care of her. She'd been afraid when she first woke up, but once she'd seen his face, she calmed, clinging to him. He'd taken her back to his bed, petting her, soothing her until she'd relaxed. He'd fallen asleep holding his wonderful puppy-girl, and surrendered to the idea that she'd be best off sleeping nearby.  

===

His writing had been more productive than ever. The words spilled onto the page as fast as he could write them, complete, with no hesitation. He felt good about his work, and those feelings carried over into his evenings. 

Red followed him around once he'd finished his writing. She'd stay close by while he cooked their dinner, and all too often as he fed her from his plate. She'd bounce around playfully, rubbing against him, eager for his touch. While he worked on the upkeep of his home, she remained in arm's reach, quiet, obedient. 

The first disobedience came on the seventh day. 

* * * 

Twice already, he'd yelled at her, sending her back, carrying her back the last time. 

"Stay!" he roared. He tied her leash to the sign on the beach warning off trespassers. She whimpered piteously as he walked into the surf for a perimeter inspection of the island. 

He hadn't made it a hundred yards before he heard her splashing in the water behind him, eager to catch up, unminding of the danger of the subsurface rocks and shells. He had his surf shoes on, while she, once again, abandoned her beach slippers and followed him barefoot. 

He tried to ignore her, marching on quickly, examining the surrounding area, looking for evidence of trespassers. It was rare that any came ashore anywhere but on his little beach, but he was determined to remain vigilant. 

Before long she was at his side again, one step behind, following quietly. Heeling. 

He turned and grabbed her by the shoulders, surprising her, and squeezing a yelp out of her. 

"I told you to stay!" he growled. 

She lowered her head, whining softly. 

"It's dangerous, Red," he said softly. "Your feet aren't fully healed. I don't want you getting hurt again. I have to do this. It won't take more than an hour or so. Go back." He turned her around, facing back the way they'd come. "Go, or no dinner for you!" He swatted her red butt, and turned away, wondering why he was trying to argue with a puppy. 

It wasn't a minute later that he was shaking his head. She was trying to be quieter, but he could hear her, maybe a dozen yards back, following. He stopped, and moments later he heard her stop. He took a few steps and heard hers in reply. He turned around and almost laughed out loud seeing her huddled low in the water, less than knee deep, trying to hide. 

"Come here, girl." 

She stood slowly, her body still hunched over, moving nervously in his direction. He could see she was limping. Just what he'd hoped to avoid. When she was at his side, whining miserably, trying to rub her head against his side, he turned and started walking, his puppy sticking to him like glue. 

Around the next corner was a rocky land access. The only other place he'd ever seen evidence of unwanted visitors. He examined the area carefully, convinced there'd been no other incidence of trespass. When he was satisfied, he turned toward his puppy-girl. He pointed to a nearby rock. "Sit!" 

She walked over and sat gingerly on the rock. Hunter kneeled before her, taking her foot in his hand. There were some scratches, but nothing terrible. He looked at the other one and saw the blood seeping from a cut. He cursed to himself as he took the bandanna off his head and soaked it with the water from his drinking bottle. He saw the way his puppy-girl was watching the water bottle. He passed it to her. "Drink." 

She sucked on it eagerly, while he wrapped up her foot. 

"What am I gonna do with you, Red?" he murmured, shaking his head in frustration, taking the bottle from her and drinking deeply. From the first she'd always been a good girl, why this behavior, why now? 

She grinned, and climbed off the rock, dropping to her hand and knees, rubbing against his leg playfully. 

If he'd asked her, she could have told him. She was afraid. As soon as he was out of her sight, she was terrified. There was no excuse for it, but it left her trembling whining, until she couldn't take it any longer. She didn't care if she would be punished, or how much it hurt her feet. She had to be able to see him, to know he was there. 

But he rarely told her to 'speak' anymore. He hadn't for two days. She was his puppy-girl. He almost never thought of her as anything else. She was nothing like the previous women in his life, who'd destroyed him. 

Hunter knew the worst part of the island circumnavigation was ahead. He could call it off, cutting through the scrub, back to the cabin. From their current location it wasn't more than a couple of hundred yards. He had chains in his shop. He could chain her up. Lock her so she couldn't follow. 

He found himself absently stroking her hair as she leaned against his side. He smiled and scratched at the nape of her neck, where she liked it. Her little tongue came out and licked his leg. 

"Up, girl. Stand on the rock." 

She did as told, obedient as always. Or almost always. 

He squatted in front of her, using his rifle as a staff. "Climb on my shoulders." 

She did, moving quickly and easily. He stood up, and found her weight wasn't going to be a problem. "You're a pain in my ass, Red," he growled. 

She barked joyously, as he stepped back into the shallow water, continuing their inspection. 

Back at the cabin, he bathed his puppy-girl, dried her off, and took her to the bedroom. He carefully bandaged her foot, and inspected all her injuries before lotioning her body. She moved easily and quickly as he commanded. His hands covered her entire body, lingering over her breasts and between her legs. She didn't react; she never did, except to calmly watch him, relaxed and trusting. 

"I'm cross with you, Red. You disobeyed me." 

Amy whimpered softly, gazing up at him, as his hand rubbed between her legs. She wasn't even sure he recognized what he was doing. It was a slow, even motion, up and down, making her feel ... comforted, loved, happy. 

"I should make you sleep outside, without any dinner." 

Amy whined, turning her head away. She knew she'd be punished. She couldn't help it. 

"You're not going to let me do my inspections alone, are you?" 

She turned her head and looked at him. Looked him in the eyes as she rarely did anymore. Amy shook her head slowly, just once. 

He moved up the bed, his hand leaving the warmth of her crotch. He brushed her hair back away from her face. "I had an old mutt like you," he whispered softly. "If I locked him in the house he'd scratch at the door incessantly, nothing could break him of the habit. Damn near choked himself to death trying to escape his leash one time. I was using the chainsaw and just wanted to keep him safe. The stupid beast didn't care if I went to the garage and left for work, but if I was on the property, and he wasn't at my side, he went nuts." 

Amy looked up at him, and saw the glistening in his eyes. She whimpered softly, nervous. 

"Best damn dog I ever had. Took a rattlesnake bite for me. His head swelled up like a balloon before he died in my arms." 

Amy saw the tears streaming down his cheeks, and did something no puppy should ever do. She reached for his shoulders, and pulled him down to the bed. She licked his salty tears away and cuddled up to him. 

It took Hunter a few minutes to pull himself together. The he held his puppy- girl in his arms, stroking her hair, stifling her concerned whimpers. 

"Don't you go do anything stupid like dying on me, Red. I couldn't take it. You hear?" 

She smiled and rose up on her hands and knees, yipping, licking at his face and neck, rubbing her head against him, until he pushed her away, scolding her gruffly. 

That was good. She hated to see her Master unhappy. 

"You hungry?" 

She bounced up and down on the bed, barking playfully. 

"Good, cause I'm starved. Stay off your feet, while I make dinner." 

Feeding two for the last week, with at least another week to go, had done serious damage to his larder. Things always got a little low just before his regular delivery, and he was used to making do. But he hadn't been able to get any fishing done in over a week to supplement his food supplies, and he suspected it wasn't going to get better. 

It went against all his rules, but Hunter went to the back of his storage, and pulled out the 150 quart green cooler which held his emergency food supplies. The white one next to it held the liquids, while the red one held survival essentials. It was meant for emergencies only; those three coolers could keep him alive for months, except for fresh water, which wasn't an issue. He rationalized his actions, telling himself it was only two months away from his annual review and replace, where he used anything with an expiration date, and replaced it. 

He knew it was bending the rules of an actual emergency survival, but Hunter had a sweet tooth. 

* * * 

The house smelled like heaven. Amy followed Master around, watching intently, her stomach growling as he worked. 

She'd seen him come out of his workshop/storage area, where she was forbidden to go. She'd stayed at the entrance, watching obediently as he dug into the huge containers in the back. When he turned around with his arms full of supplies, she started yipping out of control. 

Sugar, canned condensed milk, canned icing, peanut butter, cocoa, even cake mix! There was more she didn't recognize. She wondered what he was making, what their dinner would be. Maybe he'd even make some more of that incredible cake! 

Amy couldn't see much from floor level, but she could smell it. She wasn't much of a cook herself; her mother had done the cooking. But she knew cooking when she saw it. Cooking and baking. 

Hunter was in a good mood, laughing, pushing her away when she got underfoot. He was looking forward to the dinner and dessert. Especially towards dessert. 

He was making his cake. He would bake it before the dinner, and let it cool before icing it. His puppy might have been ornery, but she was a good girl. Loyal, like ol' Stanley. He couldn't fault her for that. 

He made the mistake of wiping his hand on his leg, after he slid the large pan into the oven. As soon as he'd closed the door, she was on him, licking the chocolate cake batter off of his leg. He laughed and let her lick his fingers clean, before rubbing her head and washing his hands. 

"Behave, girl, and keep out from underfoot," he said, but his tone was anything but angry. 

She mostly stayed out of the way while he prepared their dinner. She heard the sound of frying, and saw he was boiling something, but couldn't tell what. Her mouth was watering as she eagerly watched. Master was torturing her, intentionally hiding what he was doing, covering things before they went in the refrigerator. 

He had plated the meal, and washed the pans while waiting for the cake to finish. When the alarm went off he took it out of the oven, testing it for a moment before turning the oven off and placing it on the cooling rack. 

Amy hurried over to her dinner bowl, watching him eagerly, yipping at him, when he walked past her. She started whining as he took his plate and sat on the couch. 

"Come here girl. Sit," he called out. 

She crawled over, about as fast as she ever moved, and sat eagerly in front of him. He grinned and patted his bare thigh. "Come here." 

She crawled between his legs, the smell of the food distracting. She sat, her shoulders embraced by his inner thighs, the heaping plate of food just inches from her face. It looked incredible. Two large ham steaks and a huge pile of mashed potatoes. 

He tortured her a little more by forking a large chunk of the delicious smelling ham, scooping up some mashed potatoes, and placing it in his mouth. He watched her as he did it, grinning while he chewed. 

"Rowf!" Amy barked anxiously. 

"Is my naughty little puppy-girl hungry? She was bad today, disobeying Master. Bad puppies don't get fed." 

He put another piece of ham in his mouth, and took his time chewing. 

It was such a big plate. So much food. Yummy food. He could at least let her have a little. They hadn't had meat in days. She wasn't really bad. Amy whined pitifully, alternating her looks between the plate and her Master. 

Hunter picked up a piece of the ham with his fingers, inspecting it. "I guess it's a good thing that my puppy-girl isn't really bad. Just a little naughty." He held the piece of ham to her lips and she gently took it from his fingers. 

It was heavenly, and she closed her eyes savoring the taste. When she opened them she saw he had scooped up some of the mashed on two of his fingers. She opened her mouth wide, and he fed her, letting her take her time sucking his fingers clean. 

Hunter shared his meal with her, making sure she was well fed. As they neared the end, he shook his head. "What is it about you, Red? I never feed my puppies from the table. Never let them sleep on the bed. You're giving me some bad habits." 

Amy was content to rest her head on his leg, her stomach full, her burn itching a little but absent of pain. She saw a little of the potatoes had fallen on his leg, and she licked it clean, before resting her head on his leg again. 

Hunter put his plate to the side, and rubbed his puppy's head, scratching her hair, low on her neck. She bent her head forward to give him better access, her forehead coming to rest on his erection. 

There was a time when she would have leaped away in shame. Amy just whined softly, snuggling in close, smelling her master, rubbing her head against his hardness, as he scratched the back of her head. 

Hunter hadn't even realized he had an erection until he felt her pressed against it. He was about to push her away, when he realized she hadn't done anything wrong. Red was a good girl. He had sat her there, demanding she get closer, feeding her from his plate. He had been the one to scratch her hair, knowing how she'd stretch and expose her neck to him. She was acting on instinct, like all good puppies do. 

"Who's the best puppy in the world?" he said. 

Amy looked up at him, with those big blue innocent eyes. His hardness was pressed against her cheek, but she didn't even seem to notice. She barked once, joyfully, and he rubbed her head. 

"That's right. My Red. Best puppy ever." 

Then he pushed her away gently. "Stay." 

Amy stayed where she was told, while Hunter got up. He removed the cake from the pan, and put the icing on it. He was too full for dessert yet, but he knew his puppy and her chocolate jones. 

When he was done, he took the icing bowl and sat down on the couch. His erection had gone away, which was comforting. He patted the couch beside him. "Up!" 

Amy climbed onto the couch beside him, scooting in close, resting her head on his thigh. She was full, true, but she could smell that chocolate. Never too full for chocolate. 

Hunter scooped up some of the left over icing on his finger and put it in his mouth, his puppy's eyes watching his every move. "Mmmm, this may be my best icing ever." 

She whimpered softly, looking up at him with those pleading eyes. He chuckled and took his time gathering a finger of icing before placing it against her lips. She sighed and closed her eyes, sucking on his finger long after any icing was gone. 

He was hard within moments of her lips capturing his finger. 

It was the third time, when some of the icing spilled over the edge of the bowl, landing in his lap. Amy saw it happen, and was instantly licking the icing away. 

Hunter felt the anger, but only for a flash. She was a good girl. She didn't even know what she was doing. He had spilled the icing, and knew it was her weakness. 

As soon as it was gone, she moved her head away, looking up at him eagerly for another taste. 

That was when he cracked. It was wrong. He knew it. She was an innocent little puppy, not a whore, not a cheating skank, not a spoiled young slut. She was just a puppy. 

He scooped up a finger full of icing and smeared it on his bulge. 

Amy didn't even think twice. She licked up the icing, and sucked on the wet material, trying to get every last bit of flavor out of it. Hunter tried to remain stoic, but he couldn't stop himself from moaning. 

It was like he'd beaten her. She looked up at him, then down at his hardness. She whimpered and pulled away quickly, cowering. 

Hunter felt bad. He'd done that. He'd frightened his puppy. "Shhh," he whispered, reaching out and stroking her hair comfortingly. "You're a good girl, Red. You did nothing wrong. Master loves his puppy-girl." 

He kept talking to her, petting her, until she calmed. She finally relaxed, laying her head on his leg, trusting. 

He gave her a little icing, and she sucked on his finger. "My good puppy-girl," he murmured. 

Another little taste, and then he did it again, smearing the icing on the aching bulge in his shorts. 

Amy was slow to respond, looking up at him for approval, before delicately licking away at her treat. 

"Good girl. Best puppy in the world," he told her. 

He had scraped the bowl clean, rubbing the last remnants on the wet spot where his puppy had been licking and sucking. It was maddening, but felt so damn good. She was licking up the last hint of chocolate, sucking at the material, her lips almost surrounding his shaft, at the base of the head. He moaned again, and she looked up at him anxiously. He petted his girl, praising her, while she pleased him. 

Hunter groaned loudly, holding his pet's head still, while he erupted in his shorts. Amy whimpered softly, then went back to sucking. 

Hunter sighed, berating himself. He'd done an evil thing, taking advantage of his puppy. She didn't understand; it wasn't her fault. 

But he didn't stop her from sucking on his shorts, even after the flavor had changed. 

Later that evening, after he'd cleaned up the kitchen and showered, he cut a small piece of cake into tiny morsels. His puppy was curled up on the couch half asleep, when he went looking for her. When he picked her up in his arms she melted against him, licking his chest. 

He took her to bed, and her eyes lit up when she saw the cake, squirming in his arms. 

"After, Red. After we take care of you." 

He removed her kneepads, and checked the cut on her foot, until he was satisfied there was no sign of infection. Then he removed her collar as he did each evening, and lotioned her body, head to toe, both sides, spending no extra time on her breasts or between her legs. He didn't trust himself. She's just an innocent puppy. 

When he'd finished the care, he sat behind her, pulling her close. She settled in, sleepy and content. Quiet until he picked up the first piece of cake. 

"Rowf!" 

Hunter chuckled as he fed his puppy-girl. She deserved it. Best puppy ever. 

When every crumb was gone he got up and took her to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth, washed his hands, and turned his back. He heard her tinkle, and ignored the moments when the water ran. He had put out a toothbrush for her after the third day, and she used it. He didn't like to watch that. Nor did he watch when she brushed her hair. When she was done, she gave a little bark, and he took her back to bed. 

He laid her down on her side, and covered her with a sheet before climbing into bed himself. He cuddled up to her, stroking her hair, telling her what a good girl she was. He did his best to ignore the stiffening between his legs. 

* * * 

The next day he was distracted. He was unable to get much writing done, so he took his puppy down to the beach, and played fetch in the waves until she was tired. He fed her lunch, after putting a new band-aid on her foot, and when she slept in her corner, he gave the writing another shot. 

He didn't need to. The previous week he'd completed a month's worth of writing. He was not only caught up, but weeks ahead. Still, it was his routine, and he stuck to it. He did manage to get a little done, about as much as he'd been doing before his pet's arrival. That thought disturbed him.  

===

Hunter knew what he had to do. In a little more than a week, the supply boat would come, dropping off his order, and leaving with his latest writing effort and his next order for supplies. He knew he'd have to take her back, let his puppy-girl go. Put her on a plane to her family, who must be going crazy with worry. He didn't want to, but he knew it was the right thing to do. 

But it was dangerous. He's gone to great lengths to disappear, and he'd have to make sure she understood that. She couldn't reveal who he was or his whereabouts. He'd seen her looking at his books, peeking at his work. He was aware that she probably knew who he was. He could only hope she really was as loyal as she seemed. 

The alternative was to keep her locked up and hide her presence. Not only would that be an evil thing to do, but his delivery of food wouldn't be enough for two people for two months. Hell, it barely lasted eight weeks for just him. No, he couldn't do that. 

He pushed the thoughts away, and got up to make dinner. His puppy was still sleeping. He still had most of the canned ham he'd opened, but that would last for a while, and he hated eating the same food on back-to-back days. Food fatigue was one of the first dangers he'd encountered, eating the same thing day after day. He'd learned to diversify his orders, eating a vast array of different things. 

He also rarely ate large dinners. He kept his meals small, to stay fit. He couldn't afford to get out of shape or unhealthy, stuck as he was, alone. Or at least as alone as he'd been. 

Hunter decided to keep it simple. He was out of bread, or he would have made peanut butter and honey sandwiches, since he'd broken the peanut butter out of his hoard. It was one of his favorites, and he'd emptied his last jar three weeks ago. He remembered seeing a stash of Saltines in his storage. Peanut butter and honey crackers it was. 

When he had a tray full of prepared crackers, he took his condensed milk and made a pitcher full. It was one of the things he missed on the island, fresh milk. Even the boxed milk went bad once he opened it. 

He placed a tray beside the couch, and went to wake up his puppy-girl. Standing over her, he couldn't believe how much better she looked in a little over a week. Her skin was still peeling in places, but it was 95% healed. Her feet were in much better shape, almost completely healed. Her hair shone. She looked beautiful, lying peacefully at his feet. 

"Wake up, Red," he said, stroking her side. "Dinner's ready." 

Her eyes opened slowly and she smiled when she saw him. She stretched, and rubbed her head against his leg as she crawled toward her bowl. 

"Over to the couch. I've got a special treat for my perfect puppy." 

He sat on the couch, bent over and patted the floor in front of him. Amy sat up eagerly, between his legs. He reached over to the tray, and retrieved a pair of crackers. "I hope you like this. Peanut butter and honey crackers." 

He fed her one, and was pleased with the way her eyes lit up. 

The crackers were messy, the honey having a tendency to drip off the sides. Amy took advantage of his messy fingers, licking them clean whenever he'd let her. After every few crackers, he'd give her a sip of the milk when he felt thirsty. The tray was nearly empty, as was the large glass, and Hunter had been hard from the very first lick. 

He knew it was wrong. He knew it was wrong when he'd changed into his flimsiest shorts before dinner, no shirt, no underwear. He knew it was wrong when he'd brought the peanut butter and honey over on the tray. It was wrong to spill the honey on his bare leg, watching her lick it clean. 

It was especially wrong when he poured the honey over his aching bulge. 

Amy looked up at him, then down at the tasty mess. She hesitated only a moment before starting to lick it clean, peeking up at him, when he moaned. 

"Good girl," Master whispered, petting her. 

When he reached inside his shorts leg, and pulled his hard cock out, somewhere deep down inside Amy, she knew what he was doing. He wanted her to lick him. He wanted her. But Amy's puppy-mind had her pulling back, waiting for another treat, looking up at her Master expectantly. 

Hunter watched her, seeing nothing but his innocent puppy-girl, obedient, loving, waiting for her dinner. "You ... you don't have to," he whispered. 

Amy leaned forward and licked his shaft once. "Rowf!" she barked. 

Hunter chuckled and smeared the peanut butter along his shaft, and poured honey over the head. Then he leaned back and watched his puppy-girl enjoy her meal. She didn't even look up when he groaned. Her tongue lashed out, cleaning him of her treat. She was slow and thorough, making sure she got everywhere, taking her time licking the honey off the head, sucking most of the crown into her mouth, until it was clean. 

She looked up once and continued her licking starting at his straining balls, covering every bit of quivering flesh. Her breath was warm and tantalizing, her hot tongue maddening. 

"Good puppy-girl," he whispered. "Good Red." 

When he was clean he did it again. She didn't hesitate that time, scooting in closer, stretching her puppy tongue out further, curling it around his shaft. She worked her way upward, taking the sticky head in her mouth, her tongue curling around it, making her Master groan. Afterward she gave him long playful licks, looking up at him, then glancing over at where more of her treat waited on the tray. 

The third time he only poured honey over the head, and pushed his cock straight out toward her. She looked up at him once and opened her mouth. He placed the head inside her open mouth, and sighed as she took her time sucking him clean. 

"Good girl," he moaned. 

Sucking was something his little puppy-girl did well. He stroked her hair, while her tongue did devilish things. She sucked him in deeper, stretching her lips forward to make sure she missed none of her treat. She stopped only when the head pressed against the back of her throat. She moved her head up and down, until no taste remained of her sweet treat. Only the taste of Master. 

He was agonizingly close, when she pulled away, licking her lips. He reached for the honey, and she yipped, looking over at the peanut butter. He took the hint and smeared the peanut butter on the top half of his cock, before holding it out for her. 

While she sucked him, he petted her, telling her how wonderful she was, the best puppy ever. She was still sucking when he reached the point of no return. He groaned and came powerfully. 

He felt a surge of guilt, as he saw the surprised look in her eyes. He'd broken her trust, abused his innocent little puppy. She whimpered, but kept sucking, his hand on her head, not forcing her, but conveying his desire. When he started softening, he stroked her hair softly. 

"I ... I'm sorry," he whispered. 

Amy looked up. Master was sad. She smiled for him, and licked his thing. Then she looked over at the milk. "Rowf!" 

He chuckled and held the glass to her lips while she drank deeply. Afterward, he wiped her lips clean, and sucked his own finger. She leaned forward, smiling, sated, resting her head between his legs, licking his shrunken penis a couple of times, before closing her eyes. 

Hunter rubbed her head, scratching the back of her neck, reminding her she was the best puppy in the whole wide world. 

He cleaned up after dinner, and did some reading on the couch. Amy was content to lie beside him, her head on his leg, as he stroked her hair endlessly. Before bed he cut them both a piece of cake and fed her. Afterward he bathed his puppy-girl, giving her the privacy to do her night-time ritual, before taking her to bed. 

He gave her body a quick inspection, removing the band aid from her foot to let it breathe and heal. He stripped her of her kneepads and collar, and used the last of the lotion on her. "All gone," he said as he finished. 

He might have spent a little extra time on her breasts and between her legs. She was such a good, such a pretty puppy-girl. He was proud to be her owner. 

When the lights were out, she curled up and he wrapped her in his arms. "I love my little puppy-girl," he murmured. 

A tiny part of Amy wondered if he'd take her soon. If Master would breed her. A tinier part wondered if she'd ever have to leave Master. Another part of her wondered if she could get him to put the cake on his thing. That would be a tasty treat. There was no part of her that felt any guilt or regret. She had made Master happy. And that was good. 

* * * 

The next morning was a fruitful one. Hunter got a lot of writing done, and spent a couple of hours in self-editing after a simple lunch. He fed his puppy, even giving her a tiny piece of cake before taking her outside for a walk and returning to his work. 

The afternoon proved distracting. She was crawling around the cabin, apparently restless. When she turned away from him, he couldn't tear his eyes off her cute little butt, and the fleshy opening beneath it. Once he knew he wouldn't be getting any more writing done, he called it a day. 

He stood stretching, and his puppy was beside him, holding her leash in her teeth. Hunter laughed. "Why not? It looks like a good evening for fishing." 

It wasn't a particularly good evening, but it wasn't fruitless either. The only bad part of it was seeing a boat in the far distance. It reminded him that his days with his puppy-girl were numbered. He did manage to catch a couple of decent sized fish, and announced that he knew what they were having for dinner. 

He fed her from the couch again, and gave her a piece of cake. She was in a playful mood and he joined her on the floor, playing roughhouse with her, teasing her, wrestling over her chew toy. When she nipped him a little too hard, he sat up. "Bad girl!" he snapped, slapping her bare ass. 

She cowered before him, whining deep in her throat. 

He sat beside her, lifting her chin. She rolled over onto her back, exposing her belly, curling up her arms and legs, whimpering. 

"We don't bite Master, Red," he said softly. "Never." 

She whined miserably, turning her head to lick his knee. 

The wrestling had its expected effect on Hunter, rolling around on the ground with a beautiful naked puppy-girl. He stood and removed his shorts, his cock standing proud. "Show Master you're sorry." 

Amy looked up at him, then down at his cock. She rolled onto her hands and knees, knowing what Master wanted. She took his cock in her mouth, sucking and moving her head back and forth. 

"Good girl," Hunter said. "I know you didn't mean it. Not my Red. Not my perfect puppy-girl." 

Amy knew what Master desired most. She saw the way he looked at her. Master was a boy, and Amy knew what boys wanted. She pulled her mouth off of him, and turned around, lifting her bottom, presenting herself to him. 

Hunter's heart was racing. He knew if he was a better man, he wouldn't do this. Instead he moved behind her, caressing her ass and back. "Who is Master's favorite puppy?" 

"Rowf!" Amy replied, wiggling her butt teasingly. 

Hunter took his cock in hand and rubbed it between her legs. Naughty puppy- girl. She was eager ready for him. She whimpered slightly as he entered her, before accepting his forceful strokes, eventually pushing back against him. 

Hunter was in heaven, gazing down at the girl before him. Her soft, giving flesh, watching his shaft pierce her again and again. He could hear her panting for him. Such a good puppy-girl. He closed his eyes, reveling in the silky smooth feeling, replaying in his mind the way she had turned, lifting her cute little bottom up to him. Inviting him. She wasn't bad, he knew. She only wanted to please her master. 

He caressed the skin of her back, marveling at what a perfect little puppy-girl she was. How deliciously tight she was. How lucky he was to have her stray onto his island. He grabbed her hips, and thrust powerfully, deeply, feeling her tremble. He leaned over her, hammering away at her tight little puppy-hole, groaning at how wonderful it felt. 

He slowed down, stroking into her gently, his hands caressing her back. "Good girl. Such a good, good girl," he whispered. Then he took her hips in his hands and pumped her strongly, unable to hold back any longer. He cried out as he came inside of her. 

When he pulled away, lying back on the floor, Amy turned around and cuddled up to him, pushing her head under his hand, until he stroked her hair. He looked down and saw the tears on her face. It broke his heart, as he never expected anyone would again. The guilt swept over his like a tidal wave. 

"What's wrong, Red?" he asked. 

She only whimpered. 

"Please, A-A-Amy, speak." 

It was like a curtain had parted. She crawled forward and clung to him sobbing. 

"Did I hurt you, baby? Are you okay? Tell me, please. Speak." 

It was difficult for her to form the words. "I ... I was a virgin," she said. 

Her words devastated Hunter. All the early thoughts he'd had of her that first day were so wrong. His innocent puppy-girl really was innocent. He'd taken that from her. He was a beast. "I'm sorry baby. I'm so sorry." 

She shook her head, raising it to look in his eyes. "No. I wanted Master to have me. To be my first. I love Master. I want to be the best puppy ever." 

"You are. The best, prettiest puppy-girl in the whole world. You are perfect." 

She closed her eyes, and settled onto his chest, holding him. Holding her Master. Pleased that she could make him happy, and that he wasn't mad at her anymore. 

That night in bed, when Master got hard, Amy presented herself to him, guiding his stiffness where it belonged, where Master would be happy. Master moaned and pushed deeper into her, holding her hips before thrusting into her. She was still a little sore, but nothing like the pain of the first few days. She was happy to take care of Master. After a while she even started to like it. She was starting to feel a fire burn inside her when Master groaned and filled her. 

* * * 

After that night, it seemed Master was always happy. And Amy was happy that Master was happy. 

She found that if she could get his attention, and present her wiggling tail, Master would stop his work and take her. She liked making Master happy, hearing his moans, telling her what a good girl she was. 

She almost never ate from her food bowl, only using her water bowl. Master enjoyed feeding her. Making her special meals, giving her chocolate, playing with her. Pampering her. Sometimes they'd play the eating game with Master putting her food on his Master's tool. Amy liked the game, getting a treat and making Master happy. One time she and Master played the game for a long time, continuing after she'd gotten her first salty treat, until his tool was big and hard again. Master had picked her up and held her in his lap, his big tool inside of her, while he told her what a wonderful puppy she was, the best in the world. She liked sitting in Master's lap, making him happy, while he petted her both inside and out. 

She knew he had work to do. Important work. So sometimes she just watched him from her corner. Other times she'd whine at the door, and he'd let her out to play outside while he worked at his table. On those occasions she would often look back through the window, to see him sitting there. Twice he saw her watching him, and came outside to play with her. A few times she would crawl behind the couch, and read the books that Master wrote. 

Then she would find Master, looking for some attention, burying her face between his legs until he was hard and made puppy-love with her. 

It was in their bed one evening, when Master mounted her from in front. He told her what a good girl she was, and kissed her. She felt the fire burning, but this time it wouldn't go out. Master pressed deeper and deeper inside, taking her, until she cried out, shuddering, scared. 

"Shhh," Master crooned. "You're a good girl, Red, a good puppy-girl. It's alright. It's good that you come for Master." 

After that, Master would work to make sure his little puppy-girl had the fire. He would use his fingers, even his mouth, until she was shaking, and then use his Master's tool on her, to make the volcano explode. Amy loved Master, and loved what Master did for her. 

Life was perfect for Amy, and she was content to know that Master was happy, that Master loved her, and would always take care of her. 

* * * 

Hunter couldn't help himself. For the last two days he'd done no writing at all. He spent all his time with his puppy-girl, playing with her, teasing her, roughhousing in the sand. 

And of course doing the best he could to wear off the outer two layers of cock skin. 

He couldn't get enough of her. Knowing how few their days together were, now counted in hours, he had to spend every possible moment with her. He took her on an exploration of his island, describing every rock, every cranny. He showed her the large freshwater pond that had more than doubled the cost of the island. They played under the tiny waterfall that appeared only after a heavy rain, when the pond overflowed. They stood on the highest point, looking all around as he told her about each of the adjacent chunks of rock, pointing out the only other inhabited one, in the far distance. He played with her in the waves, and lay with her on the soft sand. 

His mind was working overtime, looking for a solution that would allow him to keep his darling puppy-girl, but it was futile. 

And so, he pushed it out of his mind, emptying his larder, spoiling her rotten, and accepting every opportunity to love his puppy-girl, each time as if it was his last. 

With a dozen hours to go, he lay with her, in their bed. He'd made her cry out for him, twice, her adorable little barks, before he achieved his release. She was panting, equally sated. 

He held her in his arms. It was time. Well beyond time. 

"The boat is coming tomorrow," he said softly, struggling to keep his voice steady. He felt her stiffen in his arms, but she didn't respond. 

"Tomorrow. The boat comes tomorrow. I'll be taking you to the big island so you can go home. Do you understand?" 

Amy understood. Master didn't want her. He was sending her away. Back to that other life. She nodded, and curled up in a ball, whimpering. 

Hunter did his best to stay the tears. He held his puppy-girl, petting her hair, stroking her hip, wondering if he could go back to the way his life was before she arrived. 

* * * 

In the morning, he refused to collar her. He insisted she wear a pair of shorts he gave her, and the smallest of his t-shirts, which was still like a dress on her. He called her Amy, demanded she walk upright, sit at the table, eat with a knife and fork. 

Amy did as she was told, obedient to her Master. She ate as she was instructed. The last piece of cake didn't taste nearly as wonderful, when she couldn't eat if from her Master's hand. 

Master was sad. Amy could see that. Anybody could see. Why would he send her away if it made him sad? She watched him quietly through the morning, telling her of their plans. She heard, but didn't listen. 

She watched him make out his list, opening each cabinet, writing down his necessities. 

He stood long, staring out the window. "They'll be here soon." He walked over to her and rubbed her hair. "Best puppy I ever had," he said. "Best in the world." 

Hunter walked to the bedroom, to retrieve the two suitcases he would take on his journey. Hers was all but empty, but he would fill it with what she needed before sending her home. He knew there would be questions, but he would deal with those. 

He returned to the living room. The door was open, and his puppy-girl was gone. 

* * * 

The island wasn't that large. He ran, crying out her name. "Red! Where are you Red?" He whistled for her, and when that didn't work he called her by that other name. "Amy!"  

===

He found her shorts just beyond the steps, and found her shirt hanging from a tree a dozen yards from the house. He screamed her name, searching everywhere he could. She had to hear him. 

He'd covered most of the island, when he heard the two short and one long blast of the delivery boat's horn. He was torn. He had to find his puppy-girl, but if he didn't meet the boat, they wouldn't deliver his goods. They'd likely starve in the two months before the boat would come again, if it ever did come again. His cabinets were bare, and he'd dug deeply into his emergency rations. What was left wouldn't be enough for the two of them. 

He ran back to the beach, shouting, yelling that he was coming. He still called out to Amy, to Red, to his puppy-girl, only stopping when he neared the cabin. He didn't want to have to explain a missing girl on his island. 

The two men who made a living delivering groceries and necessities to remote islands in the area, while serving as an occasional taxi service, were unloading their boat as he arrived, running down the beach. 

Hunter tried to remain calm as money exchanged hands, and he gave them his list, along with the envelope addressed to his publisher, containing the two CDs and a hard copy of his latest work. Not all of his latest work, just enough to keep him up-to-date with his commitments. 

As their business was concluded, Hunter stopped them. 

"Can you make that delivery in one month, instead of two?" he asked. 

The older man, the father, shrugged. "Whenever. The cost is the same. Same day, next month?" 

"Please. I need to make a few changes to my list, if that's alright," Hunter said, holding out a trembling hand. 

The younger man took the list out of his plastic folder. Hunter ran up to the cabin, and quickly added a number of additional items to the list. He didn't want to run low. He opened his desk drawer, and took out an additional hundred dollar bill. 

Back at the boat, he handed them his new list, and the cash. "Thank you. Sorry for the delay." 

"Next month," the older man said, as his son pushed the boat away from the beach, before climbing aboard. It hadn't cleared the breaks, before Hunter was back to searching for his lost puppy-girl. 

* * * 

It was pitch black before he knew he had to stop for the night. He had to get his supplies up to the cabin. Get the perishables into the refrigerator and freezer. Move the rest off the beach, and under protection. 

Hunter was exhausted, irritated and worried by the time he was done. He was also starving. Delivery day was always a great one, a time to feast on fresh food. He didn't feel like feasting. 

He slept fitfully, alone in his bed. He wondered where his girl was, where she was hiding. Had she injured herself? Was she unable to respond? Had she run out into the water? Was she lost for good? 

His pillow was wet before he finally fell into an exhaustion fueled sleep. 

* * * 

Hunter was up with the dawn. He ate quickly, and prepared a pack with water and food. He wouldn't stop searching until he found her. He looked out the window into the pouring rain, wondering how long it had been going on. It didn't matter. 

He called out to her constantly, until he was hoarse. He took his time, moving carefully, searching everywhere possible. The sun was low in the sky, but at least it had stopped raining. He'd covered every inch of the land, without success. Back at the cabin he refilled his water bottle, and headed down to the beach, walking around the island, a second time, unwilling to give up. 

The coast of his island was mostly rocky, with two thirds of the waterline covered with low cliffs and outcroppings, rarely more than ten feet high. He had passed the backside stony beach where he recalled the day she'd followed him. Where he'd bandaged her foot. He inspected the small inlet, with no success. He continued his search, and was only a hundred feet or so away from his beach, when he saw her. 

She was naked, huddled under a tiny outcropping, sitting in shallow water, behind a rock. It would have been easy to miss her. She was shaking. 

Hunter didn't call her name, or shout. He ran through the shallows, stumbling twice before he caught her. Her lips were blue, and she was cold. 

He picked her up and cradled her in his arms, turning and heading for the beach. 

"What have you done, Red?" he whispered. "Why did you run?" 

She didn't respond, couldn't respond. 

* * * 

Back in the cabin, he wrapped her in blankets before starting her bath. He placed her in the hot water, bathing her, washing the salt-water off of her skin, trying to bring her temperature up. She was still trembling as he forced some Tylenol between her teeth, and poured water into her mouth until she swallowed. She coughed and gagged, but he stayed with her, getting her to drink a little. 

Her eyes opened for a moment, looking up into his concerned face. She whimpered and closed hers again, going limp in his arms. 

Hunter took her to bed, covering her in blankets. She was shivering uncontrollably, but her skin was on fire. "Hang in there, Red," he whispered. "We'll get you better. I promise. Master promises." 

For two days he cared for her, forcing her to take her Tylenol, fighting her fever, wiping her body down, cleaning her messes, encouraging her to drink whatever she could. He was frantic with worry. 

It was the morning of the third day after the delivery, that he woke with his puppy-girl in his arms. She was holding him, whimpering fitfully. He placed his hand on her forehead, and knew her fever had broken. 

"What am I going to do with you, Red?" he whispered. 

Her eyes opened, no longer dull and unseeing. She sighed and cuddled in closer, her tiny tongue licking his chest. 

"Why did you run? What were you thinking? You could have died out there." 

Amy only whined piteously, clinging to her Master. 

Hunter sighed. "I bet you're starving." 

She nodded. 

"Let's get you cleaned up, and I'll see if I can't scrape something together for you to eat." 

He ran her bath, and carried her to the tub, lowering her into the hot water. "Get out when you're done. I'm going to cook us some breakfast." 

With so much fresh food available, Hunter cooked up a feast. Fresh eggs, butter, bread, bananas, bacon. Enough to feed them both twice over. He was draining the bacon, when his puppy-girl appeared. She looked wonderful, crawling across the floor, her kneepads on, her collar around her neck. 

Hunter knelt beside her, stroking her moist hair. "Don't ever do that again. You scared me to death," he said, before leaning over and kissing her forehead. She rubbed up against his leg, lifting her head, and sniffing. She smiled. 

"You are such a greedy little puppy," Hunter laughed. He patted her head, and picked up the tray, heading for the couch. She followed at his heels. 

He beckoned her to sit at his feet, and held out two pills. "Open up," he said. 

She opened her mouth and he placed the pills on her tongue, before holding a glass to her lips. She sipped greedily at the juice. 

Hunter fed her, praising her, telling her what a good girl she was, continuing until she refused to eat any more. Together they'd managed to finish all but a few bites. 

He could see she was exhausted, so he carried her to bed. Covering her up, he cleaned the dishes, and filled a glass with water which he placed beside the bed. Climbing in bed with her, he noticed he'd forgotten to remove her kneepads and collar. He took care of those, and lay down beside his puppy-girl, caressing her skin, happy she was better. And mad at what she'd put him through, now that he wasn't worried about her survival. 

When he woke, she had climbed almost completely on top of him, clinging to him. He looked at her, and saw her looking back. "I'm very angry with you," he said. 

She lowered her eyes, and tucked her head into his neck. 

"You scared me to death. I thought you had died. You almost did." 

She whined softly. 

"Bad girl!" he snapped, swatting her butt, making her yelp. "Bad Red!" 

Amy crawled away from him, on her hands and knees, then paused at the edge of the bed, wiggling her naked bottom, and peering back at him, over her shoulder. 

It was a look that Hunter had grown to know and love in the last week before the boat arrival. He hurried behind her, and without any preliminaries, thrust into her hard, making her yelp. 

"Never, ever, do that to me again, Red!" he growled. "Don't scare me like that. What if something had happened? What would I do without you?" 

Master was different. He'd taken her many, many times, but never like that. No matter how much they played, he had always seemed to be holding back. Not this time. This time Master was completely in charge, which Amy liked. 

Hunter hammered his cock into her, punishing her for running away. He pushed her shoulders down to the bed, growling as he took her, reminding her who was Master, and who was only a puppy. Her legs were unable to withstand the onslaught, and she slowly sank lower onto the bed. He followed, staying with her, thrusting away viciously. She whimpered, pushing back at him, accepting his punishment, sinking onto the bed until she was prone, helpless, pinned by his weight. 

He stretched out over her, his legs holding hers down, his hands holding her arms outstretched, his face next to hers, scolding her, biting down on her neck and shoulder, his cock driving deep inside of her, relentless. 

With every thrust, Amy surrendered more, accepting her Master's wonderful punishment. Whimpering sweetly, yipping lightly when he would penetrate too far, content to serve her Master. Happy to please him. 

Neither was aware of how much she liked it, until she abruptly howled for him, trembling, as the special fire tore through her body. 

Master was determined to make his point, and he took her repeatedly, only stopping to feed and medicate his poor puppy-girl. When he was finished with her, he was completely exhausted both mentally and physically. His special girl was helpless in his arms, equally sated. 

Hunter was slow to awake to the unusual feeling. He gasped as he realized his puppy-girl was riding him, bouncing up and down on his cock. They'd never done that before. She'd never initiated things except by her teasing, and she'd never been on top of him. It felt incredible, but unexpected. 

"Red?" 

Amy leaned over Master, her hands resting on his shoulders, her breasts swaying as she rocked back and forth. She leaned down and kissed him, fiercely, surprising him once again. Then she sat up, enjoying herself on his cock, stretching and grinning. He reached for her breasts and she leaned forward to give Master better access. 

After all the day's activity, and the number of times he'd already come, it took a long while for him to finish. Amy was in no hurry, enjoying Master's undivided attention. 

Hunter felt the end approaching, watching his wild puppy, groaning when he could hold back no longer. When he was done, she laid down upon him, gasping for air. He caressed her moist skin. "Love you, Red. Master loves his puppy- girl." 

Amy sighed, rolling off of him, and pulling on his arms to make him cuddle her from behind. It wasn't long before he stopped wiggling, both of them breathing easier in the dark. Both of them exhausted but happy. 

"I don't like the name Red. I'm Amy. And Amy goes where Master goes, forever. Don't even think of sending me away again." She tugged his arms tighter around her, safe and warm in Master's embrace. 

Hunter was surprised. More than surprised, shocked. He stiffened and his puppy- girl whimpered, wiggling against him. He hugged her tightly. "Love you Amy. I'll never let you go." 

Amy knew Master was happy, so Amy was happy. Which made Hunter, very, very happy.
