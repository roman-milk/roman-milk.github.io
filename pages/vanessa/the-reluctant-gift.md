============ 

What do you give the man who has everything? 

This story is an entry in the Valentine's Day contest. 

All characters in this story are at least 18 years old. 

============ 

Sheri Lawson woke slowly, shivering, not from the cold but from the creepy feeling of a hand stroking the bare skin of her stomach. She was slowly getting used to this, wakening in a fog, slowly recalling her dire situation, testing her restraints to see if anything had changed. Checking to see if her blindfold had been removed, afraid of what she might see if it was. 

Her muscles tensed, slowly, pulling at the wrist and ankle restraints, once more confirming she was bound and helpless. The hand brushing across her stomach was gentle as always, soft and callous free. Deceptive. 

"Good morning, sleepy head. I've got another surprise for you today." The voice was sexy, feminine, with a hint of mid-western twang. All too familiar. 

"Please, please, let me go," Sheri pleaded for the thousandth time. 

"In good time. You know the deal. Be good. Be obedient. Be respectful. This will all be over soon if you play by my rules. If you don't, well, it'll all be over soon and I promise you, you won't like the ending." There was a steeliness to her tone that left little doubt in Sheri's mind of what the alternate ending would be. 

"Yes, Mistress," Sheri said softly, cowering before the implied threat. 

The hand left her belly and she trembled when it caressed her cheek, fingertips running across her lips. "Such a good girl! You are learning. Perhaps no discipline lessons will be required this morning. It would be such a disappointment to have to punish you; today's scheduled to be a fun day." 

Sheri shivered involuntarily. Fun. Fun like the three days bound in restraints, spreading her limbs, stretching her far worse than the gymnastics or yoga classes she'd ground her way through in her 24 years on this planet. Fun, like learning the different types of instruments that could be used to strike her body, and having to learn each one by name and feel, thanking the Mistress for her education. Fun, like the icy cold hosing down, and stinking, stinging disinfectant she'd been bathed in. Fun, like the first two full days without sleep, while her body was subjected to a battery of insults which she learned to endure without complaint, swallowing her screams, and only moaning and crying when her spirit was thoroughly broken. 

Sheri was learning to obey her captor, even anticipate her wishes. The previous day had been light compared to the earlier ones, the stinging of the welts and the ache of her joints had subsided enough to be barely noticeable. She'd like to keep it that way. 

"Thank you, Mistress. I'm looking forward to your attention." 

The gentle kiss on her lips was one of the most surprising things to happen to her until that moment. She'd been probed, prodded, pummeled and punished, but always in an abstract, almost asexual manner. Even during the periods when she'd had random items inserted into her most private orifices, it was less sexual, more like an embarrassing intrusion. The warm kiss, with the caress of a tongue across her lips, was totally unexpected. Perhaps not totally. From the outset she'd been afraid of being used and abused sexually, but this was the first sign that her initial fears might be coming true. 

She felt the cold steel of the collar snapped back in place, assuring her good behavior. Never again did she want to feel the agony that simple piece of metal could deliver. She would be docile. She would be obedient. She would not, under any circumstances anger the Mistress. 

The wrist and ankle restraints were detached from her bed and she quickly turned and sat up, sliding off the padded surface and standing ready. The Mistress was strangely kind, guiding her across the cold tile floor by touch, instead of dragging her by the collar and letting her run blindly into the hard pieces of furniture scattered about the room. Furniture she was learning to abhor. 

Five days of blindness had heightened her senses. She could hear the dripping in the toilet area, the quiet footfalls of her Mistress behind her. The coolness of the linoleum under her feet. The smell of wood, of leather and of blood. 

Sheri was guided to the 'bathroom' area and allowed to use the toilet. She still felt awkward and unbalanced using the pot in the dark, but her blindfold was always present and absolute. In some ways she appreciated the blindfold, believing that as long as she never saw her captor's face, perhaps she would be freed eventually. 

"I think you could use a thorough cleaning, child," the Mistress told her. 

Sheri braced herself for the sudden jet of ice water. "Thank you, Mistress," she intoned, bowing her head. 

"I want you to close your eyes tightly. I'll be removing your mask for a moment." 

"Yes, Mistress. I won't open them." 

The cruel chuckle sounded ominous. "I'm sure you won't if you ever hope to see daylight again. I so prefer the mask. With drugs, there's always the chance that your sight won't come back, and of course the agony of blinding makes the slave useless for days." 

The mask was unbuckled from behind her head, and she felt the stickiness of the adhesive stretch as the material was pulled away. Secondary patches over each eye were slowly peeled back, then pulled off rapidly, like a band aid. Her eyes fluttered open for a moment before she squeezed them shut. The room was nearly dark, and she saw nothing but the bare concrete wall in front of her during that brief time. 

Sheri felt a cool cloth rub around her eyes and temple, removing any last remnants of the adhesive. Then a new cool blindfold was placed over her eyes, this one less padded and slick to the touch. "It's just temporary, for your cleaning." 

"Thank you, Mistress," Sheri replied, truly grateful. The old eye-mask had been irritating. Her sweat and tears had caked on the inside and made it rough to the touch. 

Another pleasant surprise came when her ever-present wrist and ankle restraints were removed, as was that most evil of devices, the collar of pain. She rubbed her wrists where the leather bracelets had chafed her. 

Sheri felt warm water cascade over her skin, and she breathed an involuntary groan of delight. 

"Stay still now dear, while Mistress takes care of you. Stretch your arms out in front of you and lean forward against the wall." 

"Yes, Mistress." 

Sheri felt a large rough sponge, probably natural, rub against her skin. She could feel the slippery soap spread across her body; the smell was settling and calming. She stood still, her hands on the wall, her legs spread a little more than shoulder width wide. She found herself enjoying the roughness of the sponge and the warmth of the water sluicing off the soap and sweat. The Mistress scrubbed everywhere, lifting her feet to get at the soles. The sponge made its way between her legs, under her arms and across her breasts. When it rubbed her privates she tensed a bit, but those areas were treated much like the rest, thoroughly cleaned, but no more. 

She was surprised at herself. The first couple of days she had argued, cursed, begged and pleaded. Her mind had run wild with the evils that would be perpetrated against her. Images of endless men using her, fucking her in teams, unable to stop them, helpless to resist. She schemed of ways of getting free, and getting her revenge on the evil woman who held her captive. During the last couple of days many of those thoughts had retreated to the background, and she just looked for ways to get through another day of pain and discomfort, waiting to see what she'd be subjected to next. The pain had become manageable, the discomfort something to be endured for hours on end, the brief respites to be cherished. Moments such as these, under the warm embrace of the shower, were a gift. Don't think about what may come next. Don't dwell on what had passed. Accept what was happening and endure. And don't anger the Mistress. Never anger the Mistress. 

Her long hair was grasped in the Mistress's hands, and she could smell the floral scent of the shampoo, and the achingly familiar sound of the liquid being squirted out of the bottle. Fingers massaged her scalp, and thoroughly scrubbed her golden brown tresses. She had been afraid that her jailor would cut her hair, when it got in the way of her punishment, but the Mistress seemed to like it the way it was, and even brushed it several times during her captivity. Her locks were rinsed for a long time, until she could hear the squeaky telltale that all traces of shampoo were gone. 

The water was turned off, and a soft towel was used on her, drying her quickly. The towel was left across her shoulders, the only piece of material to cover her body in the last 5 days. She pulled it close and enjoyed the momentary normality. 

Her hand was grasped, and something put in it. "Brush your hair now, and be thorough." 

Sheri obeyed, fighting to pull the brush through new tangles, tearing at it in a few places, but after several minutes she was able to pull the brush through without trouble. She continued the brushing, reveling in the familiarity of the simple motion, happy to delay as long as possible whatever was in store for her. 

"Hair is such a bother, isn't it?" the Mistress said. "That's part of your surprise for today." 

Sheri trembled at the insinuation. Perhaps this was just another tease. Would she end the morning bald? One more vicious, pointless punishment performed on her. She wasn't sure if she was meant to answer or not, so she stayed quiet, having found that being told to answer brought about far less punishment than speaking out of turn. 

Sheri felt her ankle restraints reattached, and flirted with the idea of kicking out and fighting back. For once, the collar was off and she was free of all restraints. Could she do it? Did she dare? 

The answer was simple enough. No. She had no idea if there was a way out of this room, or if the Mistress had that vicious taser handy. She didn't dare risk angering the Mistress. What would she do if she were really angry? Sheri shuddered at the thought. While the thoughts bounced around her brain, the wrist restraints were replaced again, and finally the steel collar was returned to her slender, sensitive neck. 

"Close your eyes tight, dear. I have a new blindfold ready for you." 

Sheri felt the temporary eye-mask removed, and a new soft padded mask was placed over her eyes. It was wide and allowed no trace of light within. The edges of the mask were pressed in place and she felt the adhesive anchor the cloth at the edges. 

"Come, child, we have work ahead of us." 

The Mistress guided her across the room where she was encouraged to lay down on a padded table, on her back. Her mind was already working overtime, making up possible embarrassing and painful scenarios. Her wrist and ankle restraints were anchored, holding her firmly in place. Additional straps were tied around her thighs, spreading her legs obscenely open, exposing her nether opening completely. 

Hands strayed over her pudenda. She felt fingers running through her coarse hair, tugging gently. "No, this will never do. I'm sorry, child, this may sting a bit." 

Sheri almost choked, trying to hold back the laugh. Sting a bit? This from the woman who had blistered and bruised her back, ass, breasts and legs with canes, straps, rods, paddles and whips? 

"You are so transparent, sweet thing. Yes, I'm sorry to cause you incidental pain. Disciplinary and educational pain is a completely different matter. And for this reason you may cry out if this hurts, without worry of reprisal." 

Sheri could feel the tug and hear the hum of an electric razor shearing her hairs, and warm oil being applied. "Thank you, Mistress. As you wish. Thank you for your kindness." She relaxed, for once not worried that any moment may lead to a blow for a wrong, imagined or otherwise. Praying silently that the hair between her legs was all that would be shorn that morning. 

The wax was warm against her skin, and she readied herself for the expected pain. Sheri felt cloth pressed against her skin, and pressure along the length of it. The Mistress pressed down on one end, and with a quick pull stripped the hair off of her. The pain was sudden and intense, and she bit back a gasp. In light of what she'd been put through two days earlier, it was almost a relief. She felt a giggle rise up, and stifled it. She thought she'd be left bare, but she could feel the Mistress slowly working around a small patch of hair left for decoration. The series of stinging pulls, yanking out large patches of hair descended into more precise applications, each one removing less and less of her natural forestation. 

"That's more like it," the Mistress intoned. 

The Mistress pulled her thigh open wide, painting the sides of her labia with the warm goo, her fingers pushing and pulling her pussy lips to the sides, exposing those hairs to the enveloping wax. A few more applications and Sheri thought she was done. The Mistress had other ideas. 

She continued the applications all over again, careful and deliberate, capturing any last strays. These were nearly pain free, quick and to the point. A half-dozen more applications, none more than a quick sting, and the Mistress was applying cool lotion to her mound. The straps on her thighs were removed, and her hand and ankle restraints released. 

"Not quite done yet. On your hand and knees now, raise that pretty little bottom up." 

Sheri did as requested quickly taking up a position that until then had meant a bruising for her poor defenseless rear end. She'd learned to hate that position. The Mistress spread her cheeks, and she once again felt the warmth of the wax spread down the crack of her innocent ass. The soft cloth felt intrusive, pressing into her anus, down around her pussy, rough against her sensitive skin. She tensed up, and sighed when the cloth was torn away almost painlessly. 

The folds and crevices required several more applications before the Mistress was satisfied with the results. Sheri's skin tingled, as if she'd been spanked. Spanked, not beaten. She had learned the difference in the last few days. 

"So pretty now, so perfect," the Mistress whispered, her hand massaging more lotion down her crack. The hand lingered, rubbing her, making her squirm, ashamed that she was enjoying the soft touch. She felt her body betraying her, responding to the sensual caress. Was it just another tease before the beatings began again in earnest? 

"You have a delicious ass, dear girl. So round and full, so smooth." The Mistress continued fondling her, gently stroking her pussy, running a finger through her moistened opening. A finger entered her, slowly, lingering, before retreating to rub her some more. 

"How does that feel, child? Be honest." 

Sheri sighed. "I...I like it, Mistress. Thank you." 

"And this?" her captor asked, once more sliding a finger into her, followed by a second, reaching deep inside of her. 

"Naughty. Dirty," she said. 

"Yes. It is dirty. Do you like it? Would you like more?" 

Sheri wanted to deny it but couldn't. "Yes, Mistress," she moaned, "more, please." Anything to delay the beatings. Please, Lord, no more beatings. The collar shock was horrible, and the tasering had been a new lesson in pain, but neither could hold a candle to the relentless beatings. 

The fingers pierced her repeatedly, while the other hand reached forward and rubbed her sensitive clit. Sheri pushed back, squeezing internally, pulling on the fingers. 

"You respond wonderfully. Do you have much experience?" 

Sheri felt the blood rushing to her face. "I don't know, Mistress. Not much. Two lovers," she moaned while the woman continued to massage her pussy. 

"But none now, no?" 

She knew they'd watched her for a while, from the comments when she'd first arrived. They had no qualms about talking about the capture in front of her. They knew where she went and when. They knew her schedule and knew when she was taking off on a vacation, in order to take her when nobody would miss her for a while. Knew where she parked, grabbing her and dragging her into that damned van. The beginning of this hellish captivity. It had been 5, no, 6 days including today. Nobody would miss her at work for at least three more days. She lived alone, and had for quite some time. No hope there. 

"No mistress. There's been nobody for nearly a year now." 

"Such a shame. A body like yours is a glorious temple. You should be loved, hard and often. Clearly you are not a virgin; how about oral? Do you like it? Are you good at it?" 

"I don't know, Mistress." Sheri knew the answer wasn't enough. "I've never done it," she confessed, suppressing a moan. 

"Giving, or receiving?" 

"Neither, Mistress." The words were getting harder to say, the fingers within her body distracting her. 

"Truly?" The Mistress sounded disturbed. "That is hardly acceptable. You hold back your mouth from your lovers?" 

"Yes Mistress," she admitted, both embarrassed and angered at the admission. 

"And this sweet ass?" 

"Never, Mistress." 

"A shame. Wasteful. That will change." 

"Yes, Mistress," she moaned, pushing back against the fingers which continued their incessant forceful invasion. She could feel a warmth growing in her belly, a need for more. The words burned in her mind. 'That would change.' She would be used after all. How much? How badly? How often? How many? 

"But you enjoy sex, don't you? Would you like to come for me, child?" 

Again, she struggled to deny it, but feared the possible results. The Mistress seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to lying. "Please, Mistress. Yes." 

Just don't hit me anymore, she thought. 

Sheri cried out in disappointment when the fingers pulled out of her, moaning when they were replaced with the moistness of a tongue, sliding inside of her. The shock was palpable. She shivered in disgust. A woman was licking her. She realized the insanity of the thought. She'd had no problem being touched by her, not in the way she'd been touched so far. A blessing compared to the usual. But a woman's tongue? Oh, God! Would she be used by women, not men? A man's cock would eventually tire of her, but a woman's artificial hardness used on her could be unrelenting and endless. She shivered at the thought. 

Her hands and feet had not been tied down, and she reached back, ashamed of her own actions, spreading herself open. The mouth on her was insistent, demanding, teasing and torturing. The motion moved downward to cover her sensitive nub, wresting more moans of pleasure from her which she fought to suppress. The burning feeling inside was growing, spreading, causing her nipples to harden and her breath to shorten. 

In many ways it was like her first spanking session. The feelings intensified, blotting out the rest of the world. Time ceased to matter as the pleasure took over. Sheri felt the feeling build, the pressure mounting, until she didn't know how much more she could take. The oral onslaught was merciless and unending. When she'd reached her limit she groaned loudly, begging for her release, with no more restraint than she'd shown begging for the spankings to stop. "Please, Mistress, please, I'm going to come," Sheri moaned. 

The fingers were still probing her pussy. One had strayed into her virgin ass, and the Mistress's mouth was continuing its assault on her clit. Her entire body was trembling. She'd never felt like this before, and it was driving her crazy. 

"Mistress!" she cried out. 

"Come, baby." 

The words opened the floodgates and her body was wracked in spasms as she experienced the most powerful orgasm of her young life. The invading fingers slipped away, and the devilish tongue receded, the small kisses showering her privates all that remained.  

===

"Beautiful," she heard as the blackness receded and she was once more aware of her surroundings. 

Gasping, she slowly lowered her body to the table before her trembling legs failed her. What was becoming of her? She'd enjoyed that far more than she should have, desperate for the release. Sex was something that was endured, not this. Never like this. 

Her Mistress sat beside her, running her hand down her back, soothing her. "Phase two of training has begun. You will remain obedient and respectful, you understand?" 

"Yes Mistress" 

"Good. If I should find cause to punish you, I won't be gentle this time. I expect more of you, and our time is running out to prepare you. You will submit to me, completely, will you not?" 

"Completely, Mistress." 

"Good. Come then." 

And so it began. The Mistress had been correct. This phase was even more exhausting than the previous. Throughout the day she found herself positioned in dozens of ways, forced to endure penetration from a variety of devices even more varied than the instruments of pain. Large and small, narrow and thick, hard and pliant, sleek and textured, she took them all. Few were the moments when one opening or another was not filled with some tool, straining her to her limits. Even while eating her scant meals, she endured a large plug in her poor butt, while a small vibrator worked away within her tight pussy. She grew to adore the lube which was applied liberally, making what would otherwise be continuous torture an amazing soul-rending experience. 

The intrusions into her rear were not the horrible acts she had anticipated, and with the Mistress's careful instruction she learned to take even the larger instruments in her back door, and achieve her orgasms with them there. She was mortified to find she was able to come with nothing more than anal penetration. So perverted and sick, what was she becoming? What were they making of her? 

The day was not pain free. She found it impossible to take the larger imitation phalluses in her mouth, and gagged as soon as they reached her throat. It was a limitation the Mistress would not accept, and was determined to overcome. After the fourth failed attempt Sheri was strapped over a horse, her legs paddled until she took the entire length of a mounted dildo down her aching throat. She strained to resist the gagging, knowing it would only earn her further beatings. She shuddered to think of the punishments she'd receive for vomiting. In the end the pain in her thighs overcame the discomfort, and she endured the oral intrusion as long as required, breathless, aching, but accepting. She learned to relax her throat, swallowing repeatedly, and salivating on demand. She found a way to distance herself from the act, ignoring and suppressing the instinctive and involuntary resistance, opening her throat to the forced intrusion, and accepting it as long as required. 

By the end of the day she was completely spent. She'd come more times than she'd believed possible, and spent so much time with artificial cocks down her throat, she could barely speak. Every opening was rubbed raw and she begged for rest. 

"Dear, dear child, you have done well. You've earned your rest." The Mistress bathed her again, before placing her on the bed. She applied a soothing balm to her ass and pussy, massaging her gently. She removed the collar and applied more of the wonderful cream where it rubbed against her neck and shoulders. While Sheri lay there, feeling the cooling lotion do its work, her captor brushed her hair out, then carefully braided it, all in silence. Sheri was given some pain killers for the first time, and slipped into slumber, her life already changed beyond her imagination. 

* * * 

Sheri awoke to the caresses she'd grown accustomed to. She could feel the soreness in both her holes, a reminder of her lessons of the day before. She stretched, sighing, while the hands fondled her, rubbing her more intimately, cradling her tits, gently probing her pussy. 

"Good morning, child. Another day of lessons awaits." 

She cleared her throat, testing her voice. "Good morning, Mistress. Train me." Her throat still felt raw, her voice sounded rough. 

The Mistress giggled. "Eager are we?" 

"Willing, Mistress." 

"What did I tell you?" the Mistress asked. The woman didn't sound angry. Sheri struggled to find the right answer, and was shocked to hear another voice. 

"Everything you said and more. Thank you so much for including me. Does Robert know about her?" a new voice intoned from the opposite side of her cot. 

Mistress hissed, "Names, Ivory, names." 

The new person groaned, "I'm sorry, Scarlet. I forgot." 

"Another slip like that and our guest won't be the only one undergoing training today." 

"I won't forget again. I promise." The newcomer sounded concerned and contrite. 

Sheri was abruptly as nervous as the first day. It wasn't the presence of the new captor as much as the sudden tone of the Mistress's voice. The same flat sound she'd had at first. A scary sound. Frightening. 

She tried to sit up, forgetting she was still restrained. 

"Easy child, I'm not cross with you. Hold still." 

"Yes Mistress." 

Mistress and the newcomer both worked on her ankles and wrists, freeing her quickly. Sheri spun her legs to the side, sitting up and sliding off the bed to stand before her captors. 

"She needs cleaning," her Mistress said. 

"May I?" 

"Cleaning is all." 

"Yes Scarlet, I'll be thorough and careful." 

"Go ahead then." 

A hand tugged at hers and pulled her along, uncaring of her stumbling and awkwardness, hurrying through the maze of furniture blind. Her leg struck hard against a sharp edge, bringing tears to her eyes, and drawing an unintended hiss from between her lips. 

"Damn it, Ivory! Easy! If you hurt her I swear I'll pay you back double." 

Sheri slammed head on into her guide, who had suddenly stopped. She staggered, when her guide moved aside. "I'm sorry Scarlet. I'm so sorry. I'm just so excited. Just look at her!" 

"No excuses. I thought you were better trained than this. You're disappointing me." The Mistress's voice still sounded hard, with no sympathy for the newcomer. 

Sheri's hand was squeezed tightly and she was tugged forward, "Be careful, bitch," the woman whispered angrily, pulling her along more slowly. 

After a few more steps they stopped moving, and she heard the water of the shower turned on. She could hear the rustle of clothing next to her. Her shin was throbbing where she'd run into the table, but the pain was minor, less than she'd woken up to most mornings in her new jail. 

Sheri was tugged forward, so the water was striking her waist. Ivory's hands reached up and removed her eye mask, peeling it away. She quickly closed her eyes in fear, bowing her head. 

Her captor started removing her restraints. "Oh crap, you're bleeding? Shit!" Sheri clenched her eyes shut, while the newcomer's hands rubbed the wound on her shin. "It's not too bad, just a tiny nick. It doesn't hurt too much does it?" 

"No Mistress." 

With the restraints removed, Sheri was tugged under the water, and she could hear a curtain being drawn around the shower. That was interesting. She hadn't known there was a curtain. 

"Not Mistress, no. Don't call me that. Ivory is fine, or ma'am." The giggle accompanying the new directions was unexpected. 

"Yes Ivory." 

"And you can open your eyes now, it's Ok." 

Sheri cautiously opened her eyes, and the dim light stabbed into her eyes, making them water. She kept her eyes partially closed, squinting, slowly getting used to the piercing light. After a few seconds she could bear more of it, and through the tears she could see her new guardian standing in front of her. She had a simple white mask on, and was smiling. 

"How's that?" Ivory asked. 

"Very nice, ma'am, thank you." 

Ivory giggled, then moved behind her and started soaping up Sheri's body, the sponge rough against her skin. 

"You're beautiful. I've never seen such a beautiful slave." 

Slave. The words were like ice picks driving into her brain. She was their slave, absolute and there was nothing she could do about it. She struggled to keep from screaming, biting down on her lip. After a few seconds she regained control. "Thank you, Ivory. You're very kind." 

Sheri tilted her head back and let the water beat down against her face, washing away the tears. The sponge and intrusive hands moved to her front, and she looked down at the girl cleaning her. 

Ivory was appropriate. She had alabaster skin, nearly translucent, light blue veins visible at her neck and breasts. Her hair was platinum blond, possibly natural and barely shoulder length. She was young, probably still in her teens. Sheri wouldn't have been surprised to hear she was still in high-school. What kind of people were these that would let a teenager do such things? 

Ivory's washing was taking on a new tone, the sponge gone, her hands rubbing and caressing now, touching Sheri between her legs. The girl's mouth glided upward and took a nipple between her lips, gently suckling. Wandering fingers were winding their way into her, spreading her sore lips, rubbing gently but insistently. The girl's tongue was teasing her nipple, forcing a sigh from her captive. 

The girl stood before her, took Sheri's hands in her own and placed them on her small breasts. "Ok, your turn. Wash me." 

"Yes, Ivory," Sheri said softly, surprised to find herself excited to hold the girl's breasts, unconsciously squeezing the nipples. Looking around, she saw a soap dispenser on the wall, gave it a couple of pumps and applied the soap to her shower-mate. She reached down and plucked the sponge from the floor, rubbing it all over the girl, working up a lather, cleaning her thoroughly. 

"Mmm, that's nice slave-girl. Don't miss anyplace." She spread her legs in invitation. 

Sheri moved to the girl's side and cleaned her front and back, taking care to make sure Ivory's privates were well taken care of. She knelt down on the hard tile and scrubbed the young girl's legs, down to her feet, moving around her new captor until she was kneeling in front of her, a neatly trimmed light blonde crotch inches from her face. While she scrubbed the other leg Ivory reached down and pulled Sheri's head between her legs. Sheri succumbed to the pressure, kissing the swollen lips in front of her while finishing the leg. 

"Use your hands to make sure I'm well rinsed, pretty slave girl." 

Sheri rinsed her hands under the water and ran them all over the pale girl, touching her gently, enthralled by the feel of the smooth skin. She continued using her mouth, kissing the flesh nearest her while she moved about, making sure no soap remained. 

"We're going to have so much fun today," Ivory said softly. 

"Thank you, Ivory." 

"You're very welcome. Here, stay still. Let's get these braids out of your hair." 

She drew Sheri up until she was standing, then moved behind her, the girl's small gentle hands making quick work of the braids. Her fingers were nimble, moving quickly and surely. When Sheri's hair was free and loose, she felt the shampoo on the crown of her head, and the girl scrubbed her long hair, taking her time, pressing her body against Sheri's back, leaning in close. 

"Rinse it off," Ivory said. 

While Sheri rinsed her hair out, Ivory reached around her and grabbed her full breasts, squeezing and playing with them, while her lips explored Sheri's back and neck. Sheri was leaning forward, letting her hair hang down while the last vestige of the shampoo was rinsed away. She felt Ivory's lips travel down her back to the valley between her cheeks, opening her up so that her tongue could worm its way down to her still sensitive butt hole. She was ashamed to find herself leaning forward to grant the girl better access. Warm hands spread her cheeks wide, and the devilish tongue probed her hole, pushing firmly. 

"I imagine that's clean enough," the Mistress's voice rang out from nearby. 

"Yes, Scarlet, we're just finishing," Ivory spoke up. She reached past Sheri and turned off the water. "Don't move now, Ok?" 

"I won't, ma'am." Once again, Ivory giggled when called ma'am. 

Sheri was facing the wall, and heard the shower curtain move behind her. Moments later a large bath towel was laid across her shoulders. "Go ahead and dry off, but don't turn away from the wall," Ivory said. 

"Yes, Ivory," Sheri answered, drying her body off and checking her shin for the first time. There'd be a bruise, but it had stopped bleeding. As for bruises, it wouldn't be alone. While she was drying herself off, she looked down at where the Mistress had trimmed her hair the day before. A small heart-shaped patch of hair was all that remained of her previously untrimmed bush. She smiled. It looked nice. 

Sheri towel dried her hair. When finished she stood still, awaiting instruction. 

She felt a brush against her scalp, drawn down slowly through the tangled hair. "Thank you, Ivory." 

The laugh startled her. "If I let her brush your hair, you'd probably be half bald before she finished." It was the Mistress, Sheri realized, surprised. 

"Oh, c'mon Aunt... I mean Scarlet. I'm not that bad." 

The brush caught in her hair, then tugged sharply. "Out. Go sit on the wall bench and don't say another word." The words were spat out in harsh anger. 

Sheri started to turn, but her Mistress put a hand on her shoulder, holding her still. 

Ivory whined from nearby, "Please Scarlet. I'm sorry. I'll be good. I promise." 

"Not another word Ivory. Go. I'll decide what to do with you in a moment." The brush resumed its steady work, working the knots out of Sheri's hair. "I'm sorry, child. I should have known better. She's not ready for this." 

Sheri didn't know if she should respond or not. She struggled to find something to say. "She's young, Mistress." 

Scarlet laughed unexpectedly. "Yes she is. But she should know better. What can you do? Kids these days. In my time, I'd have been scared to death to make the slightest mistake. I think we've been too easy on her." 

Sheri stayed quiet, not daring to venture a comment. 

"You, on the other hand, my child, are a treasure. I hope you realize that. So obedient, so responsive, so eager to obey." The mistress stopped brushing her hair, and Sheri felt lips against her shoulder. 

"Thank you Mistress. I'm sorry I was so insolent at first." 

"Oh no, girl. You weren't at all. I probably continued the discipline longer than I needed. I'm not perfect either." She hummed to herself, back to brushing Sheri's long hair. 

After a couple of minutes, she stopped, then reached around and placed an eye- mask over Sheri's eyes. She pressed it in place, and Sheri felt the adhesive stick to her skin, holding it firmly. She was shocked to see that it was mesh, and she could still see through it somewhat. 

"Just a little reward, dear. How does it feel?" 

"Good, Mistress. Thank you." 

"Excellent. Why don't you use the toilet? There's a toothbrush and mouthwash at the sink. When you're done, come over and join us for breakfast." 

Sheri was completely confused. This day was starting so differently. She turned away from the wall and looked around. It was like looking through dark mosquito netting. She could make out everything around her, but it all had a fuzzy, misty look. She found her way to the toilet and was surprised to find she was embarrassed. When she was completely blind, it was nothing to pee in front of the Mistress, but now, she felt a little nervous. Not wanting to anger the Mistress, she quickly did her business, then brushed her teeth and rinsed. She turned to head to the table where they ate their meals, and was brought up short when she heard a sound she was all to familiar with. 

"Owww! Please Scarlet, I'll remember!" The young girl's cry rang out across the room. 

Another loud smack of paddle on flesh, and the girl cried out again. 

"Damn it, Ivory. Show some control! Girl, come over here." 

Sheri turned away from the path she'd taken and headed over to the horse which Ivory was bent over, wending her way through the maze of furniture. 

"No, please, don't let her paddle me," Ivory begged. 

"Don't be stupid," the Mistress barked, angrily. "Come child, take your position." 

Sheri nervously moved over next to Ivory, and leaned over the horse, spreading her legs apart for stability. The padded horse was long, and could probably take another penitent at the same time. "Like this, Mistress?" 

"Exactly. Count off five." 

Sheri felt the tears well up in her eyes. She had hoped the punishment was over. She hadn't done anything wrong. Then again, from the beginning, she never had. "Yes Mistress." 

The paddle came down swiftly, making her jerk. Even after days of punishment, the jolt of the initial sting was still a surprise. "One, Mistress." 

The second blow was angled upward, flat across her ass cheeks, and hard. She bit back any complaint, and rose up on her toes. "Two, Mistress." 

The next three blows weren't as bad as the second one, and rained down quickly as she counted each off. After the fifth, she felt her body relax. She hadn't cried out, and had hardly moved after each one. She'd learned better. "Thank you Mistress." 

"See? That was twice as hard as you got, and not a peep. Not a tear, not a single cry. Did you see how she held herself still?" 

"Yes, Scarlet. I'm sorry." 

"Now hold still, and no whining, understood? Or your day is over before it began." 

"Yes Scarlet." 

"Child, you may go over to the table." Sheri stood and turned away. "Wait." 

Sheri stopped, wondering what she'd have to endure next. She could see the fuzzy outline of Mistress approaching, paddle still in her hand. She shivered in anticipation. 

The Mistress reached for her head and pulled her forward. Her lips met Sheri's and her tongue pushed hers apart. Sheri opened her mouth obediently, and when the Mistress kissed her gently, instead of dominating her, she sighed and returned the warm wet kiss. 

"I'm proud of you, Child. Thank you." 

Sheri's heart jumped in her chest, and she almost reached out for the Mistress, stopping her arms in mid-air. She quickly lowered them, and nodded. 

"I'm happy I didn't embarrass you, Mistress. Thank you." 

The Mistress chuckled. "Were you about to touch me?" 

Sheri bowed her head, the roller coaster of emotions taking hold, and she whispered. "I'm sorry Mistress. I was about to hug you." 

Scarlet moved closer, only inches away. "It's a good thing you stopped, isn't it?" 

"Yes Mistress, I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. I...I'll take my punishment." 

"Yes you will, you insolent child." 

Sheri braced herself, and gasped when she found herself in the embrace of her Mistress. "Go ahead. You have my permission. You may hug me." 

Sheri raised her arms and wrapped them around the Mistress. She leaned forward, pressing her breasts against her captor's and nestled her head into the woman's neck. She smelled of soap and excitement. She held her tight, her hands moving only the slightest bit, caressing the skin underneath. The Mistress, on the other hand, let her free hand caress Sheri's still heated butt cheeks, while the wood of the paddle pressed between her shoulder blades. 

Daringly, she pressed her lips against the Mistress's neck, tasting her. 

The arms holding her relaxed and she started to pull away. 

"Did I say you could stop, child?" 

Sheri froze in place. "No Mistress." 

"I believe you can hug me better than that. Go ahead, show me." 

Sheri pressed forward again, sliding a leg between those in front of her, pressing her thigh upward to feel moistness. She nuzzled the neck, kissing it, nibbling on it, while her hands explored the back of the woman who had controlled her so completely for the last week. One hand traveled down and cupped her ass, squeezing softly, feeling the smooth fullness, moving over and running down the crevasse, her fingers brushing against the pucker there. She felt the Mistress push down on her shoulders, guiding her face to the twin mounds, where she moved her mouth, seeking out a nipple, suckling, while her hands searched out the secrets between her Mistress's legs. She was leaning over, moving from one breast to the other, taking the nipples in her mouth, sucking, dragging her teeth gently across them.  

===

"That's enough, I think." The Mistress's voice had a strange sound to it, and it excited her. Sheri stood. "Thank you Mistress. You are too kind." 

"Were you about to bite my nipple, girl? Get a little payback?" 

Sheri was shocked. She dropped to her knees quickly, head down. "Oh no! No Mistress. I would never do such a thing!" 

The hard paddle was under her chin and she flinched. She raised her head against the pressure of the solid wood. She looked up at the Mistress, trembling. 

"Go. Sit at the table and await us." 

Sheri scrambled to her feet and hurried to the table, hearing the first slap of the paddle just as she was seated. 

"One." 

"Much better. At least it looks like you can learn. Four more and we'll be done. And perhaps you'll think twice before speaking out of turn." 

"Yes Scarlet. TWO!" The girl cried out loudly, and Sheri heard her Mistress sigh. She almost wanted to laugh. The stupid girl had no control whatsoever. 

She sat quietly, listening to the new girl receive her punishment. "Now pull yourself together, and when you're ready, join us." Sheri saw the woman approach the table, and sit down beside her. 

"What a baby. If you can't take the punishment yourself, how can you ever expect to give it out? How can you know the limits?" She poured them each a glass of orange juice, and set about buttering toast and putting jam on it. "In a week, you show more control than she does after nearly a year. God, I'm too easy on her." 

Sheri was surprised by the woman's words. "Mistress? May I speak?" 

She laughed sardonically. "Sure. Why not? It's that kind of day." 

"You understand the punishment so well, driving me beyond what I thought I could endure, but stopping just before my collapse. Have...have you had to... have you been..?" 

"Have I been beaten? Of course. More times than I care to recall. Worse than you could imagine, child. Part of my training, of course. Now go ahead, eat up." 

Ivory approached and sat down opposite her. "Thank you Scarlet. I'm sorry I disappointed you. I'll do better." 

"I know you will. Now apologize to our guest. It was your carelessness that made me use her as an example." 

"I'm sorry Sheri." 

Sheri heard the utensils clatter beside her. "Jesus, Ivory! What is wrong with you! What have you been taught about speaking to the trainees by name?" 

"Shit! I'm sorry, Scarlet. I forgot." 

"What am I going to do with you? I can't believe that after your punishment, you still can't follow simple directions. And profanity on top of that!" 

"I'm sorry! It was an accident. I promise it won't happen again," Ivory whined. 

"If I wasn't under such a tight schedule..." Scarlet muttered. "When this is over, you and I have some unfinished business." The Mistress reached out and placed her hand on Sheri's arm. "You will no longer refer to this girl as Ivory, or 'ma'am'. Understood?" 

"Yes, Mistress." 

"You will refer to her as 'girl', or 'trainee', or even 'slave' if you so desire. She is no better than you. And you, trainee, will refer to this girl as 'first girl', or, let me think, what can I call you?" 

Sheri wasn't sure if she was being addressed directly, but responded anyway. "Whatever you wish, of course, Mistress." 

"True. How about 'Amber'? It matches your lovely hair." 

"Thank you Mistress." 

Ivory was not quite so happy. "Really? You're not seriously going to place me below her are you? C'mon Aunt Jean, be reasonable." 

"That's enough!" The Mistress roared, standing and dragging Ivory away from the table. From what she could see, it looked like Scarlet was pulling her by the hair. Sheri was embarrassed for her. The girl was so stupid and careless. 

"No, please!" Sheri heard the 'trainee' cry out, and she felt a little bad to find herself smiling. 

She finished her toast and orange juice, and sat quietly, until the Mistress returned. 

"That's going to make things difficult, but I guess we'll just have to adapt. And you, young lady, will forget anything that little bitch was too stupid to keep to herself. Am I understood?" 

"Yes Mistress. It is forgotten. I swear." 

"Fine. Now let me finish my breakfast." Sheri waited but after a few moments she saw the Mistress stand. "Damn it! This was supposed to be a good day." 

Sheri stood and waited quietly. 

The Mistress stood beside her, running her fingers through her hair. "Alright, Amber, we can't let this interrupt our training. Our time together is almost at an end, and we still have so much to do. Shall we get started?" 

"As you wish, Mistress." 

The Mistress headed across the room, and Sheri followed behind. They weaved their way between the furniture, and Sheri felt an involuntary shiver as she recognized the cross she'd been strapped to for the better part of a day. Her pussy throbbed at the memory of having a large phallus inside of her, while she strained to hold herself up on her toes, the length and thickness of the invading device unbearable otherwise. She'd been whipped thoroughly until her legs had surrendered, her entire weight bearing down on that horrible device while the restraints on her wrists bit into the skin and her shoulders felt like they were being pulled from their sockets. She gave that piece of furniture a wide berth. 

They stopped at a table where Ivory, no, the trainee, lay trussed. She was on her back, her hands cuffed and linked to her ankle cuffs, knees raised high. The girl was making unintelligible noises, a ball gag rendering her mute. The Mistress pulled Sheri over beside the bench, looking down at the girl who just a few minutes earlier was supposed to help in her training. Now it looked more like she was the one who was to be trained. 

"Tomorrow, Amber, is an important day. Very important. We'll be entertaining a guest who is very particular. You will be on your best behavior and will do everything in your power to make sure he is kept happy. Do you understand?" 

Sheri shivered, and nodded her head. "Completely Mistress. I won't disappoint you." 

Once again she thrilled to the Mistress running her fingers through her hair. "No, I don't believe you will. But he's used to experienced women, and you came to me woefully unprepared." 

"I'm sorry Mistress." 

"It's not your fault, Child. And we've made excellent progress, but you're not quite ready yet. A sorry display like we had last night with you nearly getting sick on me would not do. Would not do at all." 

"No Mistress. Train me, please. So I won't disappoint you." 

"He may wish to share you, with men and women, and he'd be upset if you failed to meet his expectations. You wouldn't like him upset. He can be very severe in his punishment. I wouldn't wish that on you. You wouldn't want that would you?" 

"No Mistress. I'll do my best." 

"I know you will. Your experience with women, however, is very limited, is it not?" 

"I have none, Mistress." 

"Precisely. So our trainee is going to pleasure you. And you will learn from her. Afterwards, you will show me what you have learned. Can you do this?" 

Sheri's stomach was already tied in knots. Used by a stranger, and shared? Servicing women? Women? She felt herself breaking out in a sweat. She tried to speak but couldn't. She opened her mouth, and nothing came out. 

"Amber. You will be perfect. Believe me. He will love you. You can do this. For me. Do this for me?" 

She shivered, then nodded her head. "Yes Mistress. I will not let you down. I will submit to him completely, obey him totally, and do whatever I can to make him happy. For you." 

The Mistress was in front of her, kissing her softly. "I know you will. You will be perfect. I know it. Come." 

The Mistress, Scarlet, took her by the hand, and brought her to a part of the room she hadn't visited before. She stepped up onto a thickly padded platform and walked to the middle, where the Mistress had her lay down. She stretched out nervously. 

The trainee was brought to her a few minutes later, and she kneeled between Sheri's legs, hands bound together, ball gag still intact. 

"We'll start with the basics. Trainee, I will remove your gag now, and you will pleasure Amber to the best of your ability. If you say a single word, or fail me in any way, I will beat you to within an inch of your life. Are we understood?" 

Sheri watched the girl nod vigorously, and within a few moments the young girl was between her legs, licking, touching, kissing, sucking. She was doing things to her she'd never dreamed of, and yet, Sheri did her best to memorize every movement, every motion. Jolts of pleasure burned through her body, and after each she focused on what had caused it, capturing the action in her mind, playing it over. 

Her body reacted instinctively, but the distraction of trying to remember everything kept her from falling prey to her desires, allowing her excitement to build without cresting. 

She jumped when the trainee bit her, before crying out. Sheri opened her eyes and could make out the foggy image of her Mistress towering over the trainee, and lashing out across the girl's ass. "You can do better. She should have come by now. Are you even trying? What kind of trainer are you?" Another blow and Sheri could feel the girl tremble, her mouth settling over Sheri's pussy again, tears falling on her bare skin. 

Sheri tried to relax, reaching down to the girl between her legs, stroking her hair. "Make me come for you, young mistress. Teach me." 

She stopped concentrating so hard on the actions, and gave herself over to the feeling. She gasped when she felt a hand on her breast, and turned her head to see the Mistress stretched out beside her. "Relax, Amber, let her pleasure you. Go with it." Then her lips came down on hers, and she kissed her fiercely. 

The trainee was being rough on her, her fingers moving hard and fast, her mouth concentrating on Sheri's precious little pearl, her tongue rough and forceful. The Mistress's hand was gentle, teasing, playing with her nipple. "I want you, Amber. I want you between my legs, driving me crazy." 

The words, more than the actions, broke through the last of her resistance, and when the Mistress took Sheri's hand and placed it between her own legs, Sheri cried out, her body arching, gasping, lightning bolts of pleasure streaking through her. Her hand was gripping the Mistress's crotch tightly, and she felt her fingers pried away. 

"Good. That was a good start." 

"Did I..." Ivory started. 

"Not a word! Shut up and sit over there. You were barely adequate. Don't anger me anymore." 

Ivory crawled to the side and sat still, obedient for once. 

The Mistress stretched out beside Sheri, beckoning. "Come, Amber, I can't wait any longer." 

Sheri moved between the long slender legs of her captor, and tried to remember all that had been done to her. "I hope I don't disappoint you, Mistress." 

"I'm sure you won't. I'll give you direction to help you, if needed. Don't be alarmed if I do." 

"Thank you, Mistress." Sheri leaned forward and followed the routine she'd learned from Ivory. She examined the opening before her, as best she could. She stroked and licked the folds of flesh, causing them to fill and distend, before working her way between them, opening her, tasting her. The musky smell excited her, and the taste encouraged her. Using her tongue she tested the Mistress, seeing how far inside her she could reach. She followed that with an inquisitive finger while her lips edged forward, slowly engulfing the small tower of flesh carefully tucked away at the top. She pursed her lips around it, squeezing gently, her tongue probing, tickling. A second finger joined the first, twisting and delving deeply, while her tongue and lips teased away. 

"Oh, Amber, that's so good," the Mistress said softly, her hands surrounding her head and pulling her in tighter. Sheri sped up the motion of her fingers and tongue, not as roughly as Ivory had, but insistently. She turned her fingers upward, stroking the Mistress's insides, looked for the action that had caused shocks of pleasure within her own opening. 

The Mistress jerked underneath her, gasping, and Sheri knew she'd found the spot. She continued the motion, firm and smooth, while her tongue drew circles around and across the nub of flesh that proved so sensitive. The Mistress's hips were jerking in response, every few strokes squeezing down on her. She was confident she was doing the right things and continued, loving the feeling of being able to pleasure her captor, surprised when the Mistress cried out, pulling her face hard into her crotch, her thighs threatening to crush her head. Sheri could barely breathe but she maintained the contact with her lips, her tongue gently brushing the swollen nub. 

The legs opened, and her head was pulled up. "Enough, gentle now." 

Sheri obeyed, her fingers relaxing, still moving gently, while her tongue gently bathed the top of her Mistress's opening. The hips drew back, abruptly, with an accompanying gasp. "Too much." 

Sheri sat up, her Mistress's juices coating her mouth and chin, and waited further instruction. 

Her Mistress got on her knees and came closer. "That was wonderful. You are a fast learner, child." 

"Thank you Mistress. I'm pleased I didn't disappoint you." 

Scarlet chuckled. "Disappointed? Hardly. But we still have a long ways to go. You may be adequate pleasuring a woman when you are alone, but other distractions might make things a bit more difficult. Shall I show you?" 

"Please, Mistress." 

Sheri learned she had a lot of training to do. Over the course of the next several hours she practiced pleasuring both her Mistress and the trainee, while a variety of 'distractions' were perpetrated on her own body. She learned to compartmentalize what was happening between her own legs, from the duty she was performing. 

She practiced getting her Mistress off, while the trainee's mouth was between her own legs, and when she was being taken in either hole with a variety of instruments. She learned to continue her own actions even while orgasms wracked her body. She mastered taking a phallus between her lips and down her throat, while being taken herself. She learned to swallow whatever was shot from the end of her oral intruder, drinking rapidly, or holding it in her mouth for inspection. 

They took a short break for lunch, but the surly trainee complained about her treatment, and was once again gagged and punished. Sheri felt sorry for her. The girl was so lacking in discipline. Nothing like the Mistress. After the lunch, she was taken to where the trainee was still bent over the horse. 

The Mistress removed the gag from the trainee's mouth, after warning her about speaking out of turn. "I'll let you choose. Either I can punish you, or Amber can. Which would you prefer?" 

"Amber, please," the girl begged. 

"Child, you will spank her, with your hand. It provides the most immediate feedback. Twenty strokes please, and spread them around. Don't go easy on her, or I will finish the job for you, and give you the same. Understood?" 

"Yes Mistress." 

Sheri was torn. She didn't want to hurt the young girl, but she knew that the Mistress would be hard on both of them if she didn't do an adequate job. Drawing on her own experience, she spanked the trainee well, until her hand was on fire and the girl's ass cheeks and the top of her legs were bright red. Ivory seemed to be learning and counted off the strokes without wiggling too much, and without crying out more than a couple of times. 

"We don't know what our guest will expect of you, but it is best we be prepared for every eventuality. Let's put this on you, for your next lesson." 

Sheri knew what the device was, having been on the receiving end of it numerous times already. She didn't know that the thing being strapped onto her had a portion of it designed to fit inside of her. She soon found that when she stroked the large artificial member in and out of the trainee, she derived a pleasure of it all her own. Unlike a man, there was no limit to how long she could use it, and was able to bring the little trainee to numerous orgasms, even achieving a couple of her own. 

The second part of that training was even more surprising, as she was impaled from behind with a similar member, while hammering away at the girl moaning beneath her. She learned to ride back and forth between the two, impaling herself on the outstroke before pushing back into the sweet opening in front of her. Sheri also developed a knack for letting the device direct her, keeping it deep, pulling back when it did, and letting the Mistress drive her into the moaning trainee. 

The Mistress was not content with that alone, and insisted that all the movements be practiced with the dildos entering the other opening, driving into her ass while she butt-fucked the girl strapped down in front of her, begging for her release. Sheri found herself enjoying playing with the girl in front of her, alternating openings, working her deep and hard, doing her best to get the teenager off over and over again. 

The Mistress had more ideas for lessons, including teaching Sheri all about taking two members in her at once, one in her pussy, another in her rear. She found that she had a hard time concentrating on anything else in that position. It earned her an admonishment from the Mistress and she worked hard to keep her wits about her, and demonstrate her ability to suck on a third dildo, while being taken front and back. 

Thoroughly exhausted, and sore in every opening, the three women took turns administering to each other, applying soothing balm to their openings, with the Mistress and Sheri receiving massages from the contrite trainee. 

"Scarlet, I've learned my lesson," Ivory said softly while massaging the mistress. "Do I have to be the trainee anymore?" 

"If you've learned your lesson, why are you speaking to me?" Scarlet sighed. 

"Aren't we done now?" 

"I'm not sure how long it will be before you are done. Now be quiet." She turned her head and spoke to Sheri who was relaxing beside her. "We've done what we can. You did well today." 

"Thank you Mistress. I know I'm not ready, but I promise I'll do my best." 

"I know. I wish we had more time. I could teach you so much, but tomorrow is the big day. Just do your best." 

"I will Mistress. Thank you." 

Over a light dinner, they discussed the training so far. Sheri was surprised to find herself treated almost like an equal. Mistress explained some of their guest's preferences, and discussed his predilections and habits. 

The Mistress sighed. "It's been a long week, Amber. We've done what we can. Rest up tonight, tomorrow will be quite a day. One more day of good behavior and your little vacation with us will be complete. I bet that's good news for you. Happy to be done with us?" 

Sheri blushed. The week had been torturous, but it had also been the most exciting of her life. Nothing like the 9:00 to 5:00 drab existence of her daily life. She'd started out scared for her life; suddenly she was afraid for it all to end, and send her back to the dull grind of her previous life. 

The Mistress laughed. "Poor girl. You'll never be quite the same after this. You know, you don't have to go back to your old life. Your life is your own." 

"Yes Mistress. It's been eye opening." 

"I bet," Ivory chimed in. "That was pretty intense. Next time I get to do the driving, though." 

The Mistress sighed. "You've been so good. Unlike our little helper here. Speaking out of turn. Punish her for me, will you. It's been a long week and I'm tired." 

"Yes Mistress. Thank you Mistress." 

Ivory couldn't let well enough alone. "You're joking, right? You're not going to leave her in charge and let her beat me, are you?" 

"If you don't learn to obey and learn a little self-control I don't know when you'll ever see anything but these four walls down here. I hope I don't have to bring in some friends to train you properly."  

===

"No! I mean, no Scarlet, please. You won't have to." 

Sheri got up and stood beside the trainee. "Let's get this over with. This has been exhausting." She pushed Ivory down. "On your hands and knees. Ass up. Quickly." 

Ivory moved into position rapidly, lowering her shoulders to the floor, her butt exposed. 

Sheri knelt down beside her, and spanked her a dozen times, then switched sides so she could use her other hand, since the first was stinging. Another dozen strokes on the recalcitrant young woman's rear, and she was done. 

"That was well done, Amber. Let's go, trainee, and let our guest get some rest. Tomorrow's her big day." 

"Good night Mistress. Thank you for today." 

"You're most welcome, child." 

Sheri poked the girl beside her. Ivory took the hint. "Thank you Scarlet. I'll try to do better." 

Her hosts headed up the stairs, leaving Sheri alone. The first thing she did was remove that silly mask she'd been forced to wear all day, changing the constant shadows into harsh fluorescent light. Feeling truly free for the first time in days, she opted for a long soothing hot shower. She was sore in places she didn't even know she had. Even sorer in places she was more intimate with then she'd ever dreamed possible. 

Stretching out on the padded floor area, she inventoried her sore areas. Her back, legs and rear were almost completely recovered, still sensitive in a few places, but for the most part no longer troublesome. Her breasts were still sore, her nipples overly sensitive and still aching from the earlier whippings. The day's activities had not given them a break, and she massaged them softly, soothing the ache. 

Her sex had been severely abused, and felt raw and swollen. She got up and looked over the lotions in the bath area. She retrieved the bottle they'd used earlier, and carefully rubbed it into her openings, grimacing when she'd run up against a particularly sore spot. She had concerns over how she'd hold up the next day. Hopefully an evening of rest and recovery would help. 

Sheri laid back down, stretching out, her mind a seething jumble. She couldn't relax, thinking about all that had happened to her, what was likely to still happen. Closing her eyes didn't help. The bright lights were a huge distraction. Again she was up on her feet, searching out the light switches, finding them at the top of the stairs. She couldn't help herself, and reached out to test the door handle. Locked. Not much of a surprise. She turned off the lights, and saw there was still a glow of light downstairs. Night lights. At least she wouldn't stumble on her way back to her bed. 

She didn't know what to do with herself. She'd been kept awake for hours on end, and she was exhausted, physically and mentally. She knew she should be sleeping, but she couldn't turn her brain off. Every night the Mistress had kept her up until the wee hours of the morning. She'd been getting by on just a few hours sleep. 

Sheri realized her hands had wandered down between her legs. Her fingers caressed between her legs, parting her lips, insinuating themselves gently inside. She was moistening, opening, a second finger sliding within. After all she'd been through she couldn't believe she was doing this. Her body craved release, one more good orgasm. She rubbed herself, the soreness retreating, imagining the Mistress between her legs, pleasuring her, readying her for the guest. 

Moaning, she let herself go, building, cresting, letting the feelings take her. Her legs were trembling, her nipples aching. Gasping, she felt the surge rip through her, making her cry out. Slowly her entire body relaxed, the tenseness draining free. She smiled. Tomorrow would be a big day. 

* * * 

"Good morning, sleepyhead. Rest well?" 

"Like a baby Mistress." 

"That's good. Are you ready for your big day?" 

Sheri looked over. The Mistress was kneeling beside her, reaching out and running her fingers through her hair. Sheri rolled her head, enjoying the feel. The Mistress was dressed, somewhat. A body length burgundy teddy, and scarlet mask covering her eyes. 

"Am I, Mistress?" 

"I sincerely hope so." 

"Train me, Mistress." 

Scarlet laughed. "Dear Amber, you're training is complete. This morning is a little relaxation and preparation. I need you to get up now and clean up a bit. When you're done put the mask back on." 

"Yes Mistress." 

While she was getting cleaned up, the Mistress approached her. "Here, we need you cleaned thoroughly. You know how to use one of these?" 

Sheri took the proffered object. The plastic bottle had a narrow nozzle, pre- lubricated. "I believe so, Mistress." 

"Good. There's a second one on the sink." 

Sheri completed her thorough cleansing, taking her time, dried off and put her mask back on. She was immersed in shadows again, and made her way carefully to the breakfast table. She was surprised at how comfortable she was spending all her hours naked. She realized she'd lost a few pounds in the last week, the light meals and strenuous activity doing what her endless hours of Pilates couldn't. 

After a light breakfast, Sheri was surprised to find a quiet and obedient Ivory join them. Together, Ivory and the Mistress had her lie down on one of the tables, and gave her a lengthy massage, applying lotion to the last of her fading bruises and welts, adding some light makeup to cover any last markings. 

When they were finished with her, she was given an outfit to try on. She squeezed into the form fitting red sheath dress, letting her helpers make the necessary adjustments to get it to fit properly. She felt more exposed dressed in that silly outfit then she did naked. Which she practically was, the few ounces of material hardly more than lingerie. 

The top had a large heart-shaped cutout exposing most of her chest. The chest area had inserts, pushing her breasts up and out, creating even more of a spectacle then her ample cleavage might otherwise. The material was paper thin, her nipples pressing outward, every bump evident. The air was cool between her breasts. 

That wasn't the worst of it. Her backside was completely exposed, an inverted heart cutout baring her full cheeks. She felt the tightness of the material pushing her ass out through the opening. The rest of the dress only reached a few inches below her butt, so tight she was afraid it would leave marks. 

"It's perfect. You are going to be such a hit," the Mistress exclaimed, making her turn about. "What do you think, Ivory?" 

"Beautiful. I'm so jealous." 

"No need, dear. Your time will come." 

"Promise?" 

"Soon, Angel." 

If Sheri had thought that was the end of it, she soon found out how wrong she was. The Mistress gave her a loose skirt to wear, covering up her exposed butt- flesh, giving just a hint of decency, effectively countered by her eye-drawing chest. She was escorted upstairs, where a hair stylist waited. She tried to look around, get a feel for her surroundings, but the mesh of her mask made things difficult. She could see the house was spacious, the clatter of the heels that Ivory was wearing echoing in the open space. 

Having her hair done seemed to take forever, while her nails where manicured, and her feet were pampered. She giggled at one point, the difference between her current situation and those first couple of horrid days contrasting so vividly. 

"Something funny Amber?" The Mistress asked, from her seat beside her where she was being taken care of as well. 

"What a difference a few days make, Mistress." 

"Oh. Thinking about our first meeting, are we?" 

"Some." 

"I hope you're not going to hold that against me." 

"Mistress, I'll hold anything against you that you wish me to, or would allow me to." 

The Mistress laughed in turn. "See, Ivory? You could learn quite a bit from our courteous visitor." 

Ivory was on the other side of the Mistress, undergoing a makeover of her own. "I have no doubt, Scarlet. Thank you for including me." 

"I think she's rubbing off on you, for the better. It's too bad her stay must end soon." 

Sheri didn't want to think about that. One more evening of complete submission, doing whatever she was told, giving herself over completely. Endeavoring to please her Mistress and anyone else she might be asked to. Including the guest. Especially the guest. 

They broke for a small lunch, Sheri accustomed to the light fare and small portions. She'd been hungry the first couple of days, but now she found herself enjoying every bite, savoring the taste of the fresh fruit, the light salads, the savory small pieces of meat. 

After lunch they retreated back to the preparation room. They were alone for a few minutes, and with an apology, the Mistress replaced Sheri's mask with a new one, this one completely opaque, casting her back into complete darkness. She felt nervous for the first time in days, the blackness bringing with it a feeling of utter helplessness. 

She didn't have long to think about it. Her next visitor arrived, and she was made to remove her clothing. A touch up to her initial waxing was done, and makeup was artfully applied to her face, breasts and even between her legs. She was itchy, longing for a more prolonged touch, feeling a need for attention. 

"Patience, dear. How are you feeling? Still sore?" 

"Just a bit, Mistress. Hardly worth mentioning." 

"I understand, believe me. The last couple of days have been taxing." 

"Were they ever," Ivory said softly, suddenly stammering, "If, if that's ok to say, Scarlet." 

The Mistress chuckled. "Yes dear. I know it was hard on you as well. I hope you've learned something from this." 

"Yes Scarlet. Thank you." 

With the makeup complete, she squeezed herself back into the dress, once more making adjustments where necessary. The Mistress brought out a can of spray adhesive, helping ensure that the dress stayed where it should, particularly the top of the heart which had a tendency to draw away from the skin and flap a bit. A new pair of red 4" heels completed the ensemble. 

"His flight should be in by now. The driver should pick him up any moment. Time is running out. Time for the last few touches." 

Sheri was surprised to find out the last few touches including ample application of lube in her back door, followed by the insertion of a moderately sized plug, opening her up. She was given something to drink which numbed the back of her throat, the bit of soreness she felt there abruptly gone. The thought of why these preparations were necessary brought about a new nervousness and a bit of trepidation. Not that she had any say in the matter. 

"I think we're ready. Time for everyone to get in their places." 

Sheri was escorted from the room back into the main hallway. They turned to the right, back toward the entrance as she recalled. The Mistress halted her, and guided her down to her knees, where she knelt on a raised, padded platform, reminding her of the kneelers in church. 

"Now lean all the way down, arms outstretched toward the door. Straighten your thighs out, and raise your rear. There. Perfect. Hold that position a moment." 

The position wasn't comfortable, but certainly nothing particularly difficult, and she remained stretched out, her arms extended, head bowed. She felt the Mistress adjust her hair a bit, spreading it out, then heard the clatter of heels approaching. 

"What do you think Ivory?" 

"It's the best ever, Scarlet. Just amazing." 

"I hope Robert thinks so." 

"He'll be devastated." 

"You can sit up now, Amber. Relax. When our guest arrives I'll let you know and you can return to that position." 

"Yes Mistress." 

"Nervous?" 

Sheri nodded. "A little Mistress. I hope I don't disappoint you or our guest." 

"Dear, I don't believe that will be a problem. Just do your best. Can you do that for me?" 

"Of course, Mistress. I promise." 

"Excellent. Now hold still now." The Mistress reached through the opening in the back of her dress and took hold of the device that was still wedged inside of her bottom. A couple of drops of cool liquid spilled down her crack, and the plug was removed from her, leaving her feeling open and ready. The Mistress's soft finger penetrated her easily, carrying the lube further inside. "There, we've done all we can." 

"They're pulling up, Scarlet," Sheri heard Ivory say. 

"Positions! Hurry now!" 

Sheri quickly assumed her pose, and felt the Mistress's hands position her rear properly, and once more spread her hair out. "Arch your back down a bit, and keep your rear up. Good. Perfect." She sighed. "Amber, dear, you're going to break his heart." The clatter of heels retreating surprised her. As the echo of the footsteps softened, she realized she was alone. Completely alone, half naked, ass on display, in a position of total submission. 

She heard the door open. 

* * * 

Robert checked in his pocket one last time. The ruby earrings had taken weeks to design and create. Each nearly two carats, flawless. They'd be perfect for Jean. For once, he'd win. He knew she'd love them and could scarcely wait for his deserving reward. She was always especially accommodating after these trips. He was a lucky man. 

He opened the door, announcing his presence. "I'm home." 

Robert set his bag down by the entrance, and turned inside. And froze. 

The most amazing sight met his eyes. A woman was kneeling before him, her strawberry blonde hair arrayed luringly. Her glorious ass was raised in the air, exposed by her dress in the most inviting manner. The bright red skintight sheath had a charming cutout of the material. The girls full, round cheeks portrayed a perfect heart, the point of the heart reaching down to the small of her back. He felt his own heart hammering in response. 

Robert stepped forward, catching his breath, looking around for the rest of the household. He slowly walked around the girl who awaited him, quiet and still. From behind she was almost irresistible. The perfect ass. Flawless. He could already feel himself responding. He reached out and drew his hand gently across her bare cheeks as he continued his appraisal. The girl's tiny shiver made him smile. 

He finished his circuit, pausing in front of her. He was dying to see what she looked like. At first glance her body was perfect, smooth round butt, narrow waist, long slender eggs. He bent down and brushed her hair back, encouraging her to raise her head. A red satin mask covered her eyes, her small uptilted nose achingly cute, her perfect crimson lips begging to be used. They wouldn't have to beg long. 

"Rise up, girl. On your knees, please." 

She slowly rose, languidly, exposing the most amazing chest behind another heart-shaped cutout, displaying her full breasts, the nipples barely covered. The girl straightened up, kneeling upright, her arms behind her back, pushing her chest out. Her head was tilted up, her smooth slender neck exposed. She was stunning. He studied her for a moment, his observant gaze taking in the signs of restraint around her neck. She'd been wearing a collar recently, probably for an extended period. What had Jean been up to? 

He leaned in, running his finger across those enchanting lips. "And who are you?" 

"Amber, if it pleases you." 

"Jean put you up to this?" 

"Mistress Scarlet has prepared me for you, Master. As a gift." 

A gift. Amazing. "Assume your position, if you will, Amber." 

"Yes Master," she replied softly, stretching forward once more, as gracefully and sexily as possible. 

Robert opened his pants, unable to resist any longer. He was achingly hard and ridiculously horny after a week alone on the road. He walked behind the girl gazing at the invitation spilling out of the material. With a slow caress down her crack, he advertised his intentions. He was torn. Her ass screamed out to be taken, and at the edge of the material he could see the start of her bare pussy, lips puffy and smooth, a hint of moistness already visible. 

He decided he'd save that perfect little butt-hole for later. Decision made, he reached down, rolling her tight skirt up over her hips, freeing that full sweet rear. He smiled when he saw her flesh quiver at his touch. She seemed quite disciplined: silent, waiting, responsive to his touch, courteous in her words. Damn that Jean! Playing on his weaknesses and desires. He couldn't have designed a better play thing. He was certain he'd never seen a more delicious ass. 

He reached between her thighs and nudged them wider, watching as she slid her knees apart. Her smooth opening beckoned. Hard cock in hand, he slowly dragged it down her crack, seeing her tremble when he crossed over her tight little star, before pressing the swollen head against her moist slit. With a small thrust of his hips he entered her, hearing the smallest of moans escape her. Hmmm, not completely quiet after all. The sound of her acceptance was intoxicating. 

Grabbing her lusciously curved hips he pushed forward hard, his long thick member driving inward, irresistible, filling her completely. She gasped when his hips met the soft flesh of her ass. The feeling was absolutely exquisite. He closed his eyes, savoring her tightness and enveloping warmth. He reached down and took a cheek in each hand, squeezing, grinding forward. If was beyond wonderful. 

He heard the clatter of heels from both sides. He opened his eyes, looking over and seeing Jean and Teri approach, dressed to kill. 

Caught like a kid with his hand in the cookie jar. He grinned. 

"Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie." Scarlet said. She leaned in and gave him a kiss, resting her hand on Amber's exposed rear. 

"Happy Valentine's Day, Uncle," Ivory chimed in, leaning in for a kiss of her own. Her lips lingered, mouth opened slightly, her tongue pushing between his lips. Her soft hand ran down his chest. He wondered how much longer he could resist her allure. Jean had made it clear the time was not right yet. He'd wondered if maybe, just maybe, today would be the day. It was a fantasy he'd entertained on the flight home. His gift assuaged any immediate need he felt to claim his wife's devious niece. He was in no hurry now. 

"Enough, Ivory. You're distracting him," Scarlet reminded the teenager, before leaning over and spreading open the cheeks of their captive, getting a good view of his thick pole disappearing into her. "What do you think of your gift, Master Steel?" 

"You spoil me. Best Valentine's gift ever." He laughed, pulling out and driving into this sweet new plaything again. It felt too good to stop, and he started a slow screwing motion, easing in and out of her, her sweet pussy accepting him more readily. 

"You have no idea. Two virgin holes, and eager to please. Completely, utterly, yours for the night. You're going to owe me for this one." 

"Who's is she?" Robert asked, racking his brain as to which of their friends might have had this sweet thing stocked away for a rainy day. 

Scarlet seemed reluctant to tell the truth. "I...I sort of captured this one. We have to let her go tomorrow. But for tonight, she's all yours, Master." 

Robert's motion stopped. She was using their public names, and now he understood why. What had she done? "Captured? Sort of? How long have you had her?" 

"Just a week. It's ok, we were careful, nobody'll miss her. She was born for this, a natural. When I saw her I knew I had to have her for you. She's perfect, isn't she, Master?" 

Robert sighed hugely, pulling out of the innocent victim. He walked around her and helped her up to her knees. "Amber. You are a lovely, incredible gift. Achingly beautiful. My devious wife knows my preferences all too well. But I won't force myself on you, no matter how tempting it is." 

"I'm yours, Master. Your gift. Please. I don't wish to disappoint you, or the Mistress. Enjoy me." 

"You don't know what you're saying girl." 

"Please Master! I understand completely. Tomorrow I return to my old life, the steady dreary 9-to-5, too much TV, dinners alone, and empty bed. Tonight, I'm a fantasy, your fantasy come true. The Mistress has worked hard to ready me for you. Allow me to be whatever you want. Anything you need. Don't make this week a waste. Use me, enjoy me, Master. Don't leave me like this."  

===

He stroked her cheek, and she turned her head, those devilish lips capturing a finger and sucking it in. His cock bounced upward, responding to her. He brought his hands to the side of her head, tilting it back. He leaned down his face inches from hers. She could feel his breath on her skin. 

The desire for this innocent pawn was undeniable. He closed the last inch and pressed his lips against hers, kissing her, softly at first, then increasingly more demanding. He finally pulled away, moving his head beside hers, his mouth nudging her ear. "Thank you, Amber, for this gift. I accept." He pulled back, looking her over again. I once in a lifetime gift. One time only. Amazing. 

"Please resume your position," he told her softly. 

Sheri dropped back down, stretching out, giving her butt an inviting shake. Robert stifled a giggle. Eager little thing. His smile quickly dissipated. This really was over the line. The girl had been prepped for a week, and he could understand her need for him. A need he would happily fulfill. But he wouldn't forget how she got there, and he'd make sure she was taken care of in the end. 

Scarlet and Ivory had stood quietly, waiting for his unexpected actions to play out. Scarlet knew it had been a close thing. She had gambled and won. Obedient Amber had made it possible. She felt a warmth for the girl she hadn't expected. She found herself reaching forward and caressing the girls rear gently, knowing she'd miss her. 

Robert resumed his position, his hand slowly stroking his steely rod. Jean, no, Scarlet, had been wrong to do this. They had agreed. There would be consequences. He paused before sliding back into his gift, then turned toward his niece. 

"Ready me, Ivory." 

Ivory was surprised, but could see what was happening. This was part of Scarlet's punishment for breaking the rule. Which was perfectly fine by her. She dropped to her knees before Robert, reaching for his beautiful cock, and bringing her lips to it. She licked the length, eager to feel it fill her mouth, but wanting to stretch this moment out. She'd waited so long. 

Robert turned to Scarlet and nodded toward their willing captive. "Ready her." 

Scarlet realized Robert was more than just a little pissed, and sensed that there would be some serious fallout for her actions. Already she could see that her days of holding back Ivory were probably over. She hoped that the consequences wouldn't be too severe. She leaned in and brought her mouth to Amber's waiting pussy, using her tongue to part her lips, opening her, preparing the way for their Master's assault. She knew that her one saving grace was the gift. If the girl was everything she thought she'd be, Robert would be in too good a mood to hang onto his disappointment in her. Scarlet applied herself diligently, dearly hoping that the one short week had been enough. 

Robert watched Ivory slowly engulf his rod, looking up at him with those big doe eyes. He might have the gift for only one evening, but this little devil would be his tonight and forever more. He held her head still, and pushed deep, forcing her down on his cock, watching her struggle with it, gasping when he released her. She took it well, sucking him with abandon, forcing her way down his cock on her own, stroking him, worshipping his mighty staff. 

"Enough." He turned back to his gift, rubbing the head of his cock across her opening, watching the lips spread, pressing just a bit, nudging forward, observing the purple crown as it insinuated its way inside of her. When he felt her tightness enclosing, he pushed, slowly, inexorably, once again sheathing himself completely. 

She was perfect. How was he ever going to let her go? Damn that troublesome wife! He grabbed the girl by the hips, pulling back, and slamming into her hard, taking her, claiming his prize. She wanted him? Good. She was going to get him. Completely and thoroughly. He would make it a night they both remembered the rest of their days. 

Sheri caught her breath, slowly getting use to the huge invader, thrilled at the feeling of being exposed to the Mistresses and her new Master. She understood that there was a lot at play here, and was determined to play her part. She'd be perfect for him. 

She gasped when he started driving into her again, filling her in the most amazing way. So much better then those toys. She pushed back against his insistent thrusts, wanting more, letting him know how much she needed it. Footsteps clattered by her head, before it was raised by the hair, and she felt someone moving in front of her. She could tell it was her Mistress, by the intoxicating smell, and lowered her mouth onto the moist cleft flesh in front of her. She let the pounding behind her drive her tongue into the wet slit, reaching forward with her hands, holding onto her Mistress's ass. Unbelievably she could already feel herself responding instinctively to the hammering, her pussy clenching down on the Master's rod. She moaned hard, the first orgasm of many rocking her, shooting through her body, while her mouth clamped down on the Mistress, sucking fiercely. 

Yes. She might be the gift, but she was also the recipient. 

The best Valentine's gift ever.
