The Trip to Rancho Mirage
=========================
#1 

===

The sign read "Harpersville – 1 mile" and just beyond it another sign listed the restaurants and other services available at the exit. I needed gas and there was a Conoco station at the exit and I had a Conoco card so I pulled into the right lane and slowed for the exit. 

As I filled the tank I looked around and saw that there was a restaurant across the street. It was a little early for supper, but what the hell, I was already stopped. After I topped off I drove over to the restaurant and went inside. It had a nice 'homey' atmosphere and there were some nice aromas wafting through the place. 

I took a seat in a booth and had no sooner sat down when an extremely attractive waitress came up, handed me a menu and asked: 

"What would you like to drink hon?" 

I smiled at the "hon" and thought "Don't I just wish I could be her honey." I told her coffee with cream and when she went to get it I looked over the menu and settled on the liver and onions with mashed potatoes and green beans. The waitress, Joyce was the name on her tag, took my order and I watched her ass move in her jeans as she walked toward the kitchen to turn in my order. 

It was a little early for supper so the place wasn't really busy, at least not busy enough to keep the two waitresses fully occupied. Joyce, apparently with nothing better to do, came over and said: 

"I've not seen you in here before." 

"Never been in here before. Just passing through." 

"That seems to be the way it always is. The good looking guys are always just passing through." 

"Pickings that slim around here?" 

"Worse than slim. There are some nice looking guys, but almost all of them are losers. Only interested in hunting, fishing, car racing and drinking." 

"Then why stay here?" 

"Where would I go? I never finished high school so I doubt I could get a good enough job to be on my own. At least here I can still live at home." 

"Good enough job? A good waitress can get a job anywhere. Most of the waitresses I knew back home did real well." 

"I do okay here." 

"Then you could do okay anywhere." 

A bell rang and a voice called out "order up." And Joyce said, "That'll be you hon" and she headed for the kitchen. She was back in a minute with my meal. She left and came back a minute later and topped off my coffee cup. She walked through the place and topped off everyone else's coffee and then went back behind the counter where the cash register was. 

I noticed as I ate that she was watching me. I wondered if maybe it might be to my advantage to linger a few days in Harpersville. I could make Rancho Mirage in two days and I didn't need to be there for another nine days. Joyce saw me finish my meal and she came over and asked me if I would like dessert and I took a pass on it. She started to leave and then she hesitated. 

"You said that you were just passing through. Where are you headed?" 

"Rancho Mirage in California. I have a job waiting for me there." 

"California? I'd like to see California some day. I'm twenty-two years old and I've never been more than a hundred miles from this place." 

"So go. Just pack your bags and go." 

She had a wistful look on her face and I have no idea why I said it, but I looked into her eyes and said: 

"Pack your bags, throw them in my truck and you can keep me company on the ride." 

"I couldn't do that. What would I do when I got there? Where would I go? Where would I stay?" 

"As for what you would do I've already told you that a good waitress can get a job anywhere. As for where you would stay you can stay with me until you find a place of your own. I'll be staying with my brother and his wife and they have plenty of room." 

"You make it sound so easy." 

"I don't know about easy, but I do know that you can sit around and wish for this or that, but you aren't likely to get it if you don't get off your butt and go for it." 

She laughed and said, "That's true, but I don't know you. I don't know anything about you. For all I know you might be an axe murderer." 

"I know just as little about you. For all I know there is a jealous husband watching us talk and he might be out in the parking lot waiting to kick my ass when I leave." 

"No fear of that. There isn't a man living in this county I'd let myself be caught dead with." 

"Tell you what. I don't need to be there for another nine days. I can stay over here for a day or two and you can get to know me better. Where is a good motel?" 

"Take a left out of the parking lot and three blocks down on the left." 

"What time do you get off work?" 

"Nine." 

"I'll pick you up at nine and we can go somewhere for a drink and get to know each other." 

"You are serious?" 

"Absolutely." 

I paid my check and drove over to the Bide-A-Wee motel and took a room for a night. Then I drove around the town looking the place over to give me something to do until nine. At nine when I got to the restaurant Joyce was already standing outside waiting. She got in the car and I asked: 

"Where to?" 

"There is a bar on the south end of town called Baxter's. It is a lot quieter than the Texas Roadhouse on the other end of town." 

As we drove to the bar she said, "I can't believe I'm doing this." 

"What?" 

"Thinking of taking you up on your offer." 

"Oh come on Joyce; you have had to want to leave this place at one time or another. You must have wanted to see other places." 

"Oh I have; I've just never had a chance. First pa had a stroke and mom needed help taking care of him. Then he died and mom had a stroke and I had to quit school to take care of her. Six months ago she passed and I just haven't seemed to come up with any ambition." 

By then we were at Baxter's and we went inside and found a table. Joyce said: 

"I've wanted to leave here, but I never had any idea of where to go. I don't have any family left here and I don't have any family any place else. I guess I'm just afraid to go off on my own." 

"So you have no preference? North, south, east or west; it doesn't matter?" 

"No. I'd just like to leave here." 

Some one fired up the juke box while we were talking and a guy walked up to the table and said: 

"Come on Joyce baby; dance with me." 

"I'm with some one Clint." 

"So what? He won't mind will you buddy." 

He said it as a statement and not as a question. I didn't know the lay of the land so I took the safe way out and said: 

"It's up to the lady." 

"See Joyce? Come on babe." 

He reached for her arm and she jerked it away from him. "I don't want to dance with you. Go away." She turned to me and said, "It was a mistake to come here. We can go back to the restaurant and talk there." 

She got up and I followed as she headed for the door. The guy grabbed her arm and said: 

"Don't you walk away from me slut!" 

She jerked her arm away from him and he reached for her again and I grabbed his arm and said: 

"Keep your hands to yourself bud." 

He pulled his arm away from me and said, "Butt out asshole; this is between me and the slut." 

"The lady doesn't appear to want your attentions." 

"Look asswipe" he said as he poked me in the chest and I hit him in the face with my right and I put my full two hundred pounds into the punch. He went down like a pole-axed steer. Blood was spurting out his nose as he struggled to get up, but I moved over and put my foot down on his throat and pushed down. He grabbed my ankle and tried to push me off, but I put my weight on it and said: 

"Best you stay down buddy. If you stand up and try to carry on I'll put you in the hospital and you can take that to the bank." 

He let go of my ankle and said, "Fuck it! The slut isn't worth it." 

Joyce tugged my arm and said, "Come on. We'd better get out of here." 

As we pulled out of the parking lot Joyce said, "I guess you won't want me travelling with you now." 

"Why? Why would what just happened with that loud mouth matter?" 

"Because what he said is true. I have been a slut. I stopped a year ago, but before I stopped I was pretty much a round heeled tramp." 

"So? That is in the past right? So what does that have to do with today or tomorrow?" 

She shrugged and said, "Nothing I guess. God, but I do hate this place." 

"So when you get home start packing." 

She was silent for a bit and then she said, "You need to leave. I know Clint. He isn't going to take what you did to him lying down. He's probably on the phone to his brothers and a couple of cousins right now and they will be looking for you." 

"No problem. I can leave right now. How fast can you pack?" 

"You mean it? You really mean it? You would take me with you?" 

"Of course I meant it. I wouldn't have brought it up if I wasn't going to follow through on it." 

"Turn here" she said and then she pointed. Third house on the left." 

I pulled into the drive and parked. "Come on" she said, "I'll make a pot of coffee and then pack. How much can I take?" 

"I've got plenty of room as long as you don't want to take any furniture." 

Four suitcases and three garbage bags later we were on our way to my motel. 

"Do we need to stick around until tomorrow so you can do things like see to the house?" 

"The house belongs to the bank. They took it when mom died and I couldn't make the payments. They have been letting me stay there and pay rent." 

"Need to stop by the bank or anything?" 

"No. I don't have any bank accounts. What money I have I keep in a coffee can. I don't have any ties here at all. I still have a week's pay coming from the restaurant, but payday isn't until Friday. I'll call and have them mail it to me." 

We were nearing my motel when she said, "Oh shit!" and ducked down. "What's the matter?" 

"That pickup on the corner at the light. That's Clint's brother Carl and the two guys with him are Clint's cousins. They've never seen you, but if they see me they will know who you are." 

I drove through the intersection without looking over at the truck and three blocks later I pulled in at the motel. I backed up to my trailer, got out and hooked up to it and then hurried into my room, grabbed my stuff and got back to my truck. I pulled out of the motel and headed down the street that would put me on the Interstate. I was three blocks from the entrance ramp when a pickup came flying up behind me and pulled out to come up on my side. 

It was a two lane street and the pickup was in the oncoming lane and as it came up beside me I saw Clint and two guys in it. He obviously intended to pull up alongside me and force me to the curb, but I wasn't going to play his game. I cut hard left and caught him by surprise. Instinct made him cut left to avoid me and he ran up on the sidewalk and into a tree. I got back into my lane and a minute later we were headed down the on ramp and were moving west. 

I looked over at Joyce and saw that she was quietly crying. "What's wrong" I asked. 

"Everything I touch turns to shit. You could have been hurt and all because of me." 

"Nonsense." 

"No it isn't. If I would have just done my job and served you we never would have ended up at the bar and getting mixed up with Clint." 

"But you didn't just serve me and because you didn't I now have a beautiful travelling companion and I'm not sorry about that at all. Now stop the crying and look out the window. You wanted to see places other than Harpersville and that is what is outside that window." 

We drove in silence for about an hour and I began to get tired. I took the next exit that showed that there was a motel there. I drove into the motel and got a room for the night. The room had two beds and I told Joyce to pick one. She eyed me with what I thought might be suspicion and I asked, "What?" 

She shrugged and said, "Nothing" 

"Oh no you don't Joyce. We are going to be together for quite a while so let's get things out in the open." 

"I thought maybe that you expected we would use the same bed." 

I looked at her for a couple of seconds and then said, "I didn't invite you along to be a sex partner Joyce. You pick a bed and I'll take the other one. You want to shower now or in the morning?" 

"The morning I guess." 

"Okay. You get the bathroom first to change." 

She went into the bathroom to change into whatever she slept in and I stripped down to my briefs and got into bed. When she came out I said goodnight to her and she said the same to me and got in the other bed. 

I was in no hurry so I didn't leave a wake up call, but noise woke me up. It was the shower running. I looked over at the clock and saw that it was seven- thirty. I got up, put on my pants and a shirt and walked up to the front office. They had a continental breakfast set up and I grabbed two sweet rolls and two cups of coffee and went back to the room. 

Joyce was out of the shower and dressed when I got there. She hadn't put on her make-up yet and quite frankly she didn't need it. The girl was absolutely beautiful. I gave her a roll and a cup of coffee and went in to take my shower. When I came out she was on a cell phone talking to some one. She hung up when I came into the room and said: 

"That was Stella; the owner of the restaurant. I called her to let her know I wouldn't be in any more. She wasn't all that happy at my lack of notice, but she knew how unhappy I was and she wished me luck." 

"You ready for breakfast?" 

"No thanks. The coffee and the roll will do me until lunch time." 

I was a touch hungry, but I wasn't going to eat in front of her so when I turned in the room key I grabbed another sweet roll and we hit the road. As we drove west I noticed the way she was looking at me and I asked her: 

"What are you thinking?" 

She was silent for a couple of seconds and then she said. "I'm just thinking about what is happening here. I'm sitting in a truck with a man that the only thing I know about is that his name is Rob. I've just spent a night in a hotel room with a man and all I did was sleep. I've been expecting a move and there has been no sign of one. This just doesn't fit the picture I have of men. In my experience all men are pigs, but you don't seem to fit the mold. 

"There is a white band of skin on your ring finger so my first thought was that you took off your ring to make it easier to score with chicks, but you haven't even given me a lustful look. None of this fits in with what I expect from the male of the species." 

"The ring is gone because the marriage is gone. The reason I'm moving to California is so I can start my life fresh." 

I was silent for a few moments and then I said, "You must have had some really bad times with the guys in Harpersville if you have such a lousy opinion of men." 

"It was bad, but I have to admit that I pretty much asked for it." 

"You asked to be treated badly?" 

"In a way. Billy Denton and I were childhood sweethearts and we grew up knowing that we would get married and live happily ever after. We set a wedding date for a week after graduation. Then my mom had her stroke and I quit school to take care of her. Billy said no problem; she could live with us after we were married. Taking care of mom cut into the time I was able to spend with Billy and there were some weeks when we didn't even see each other. Then graduation came and the day after Billy joined the Army. He didn't say a word to me, just joined and left town and I never heard from him again. 

"Six months after that Billy's sister Irene was telling people that Billy was getting married to some girl he met where he was stationed. I lost it. I started dating Billy's friends. If you were a friend of Billy's you could get a date with me and all the sex you could handle as long as you wrote Billy a letter telling him all about it and then gave it to me to read and then mail. I did his brothers, all four of his cousins and his best friend in the first month he was gone. 

"By the time I woke up to the fact that Billy didn't give a damn and all I was doing was hurting myself I was the town punchboard. I stopped cold, but it was already too late. No guy with any self respect at all would have anything to do with me. The only guys who would have anything to do with me were assholes like Clint. The thing was that all of Billy's relatives and so called friends didn't hesitate to climb on board. So yeah, my opinion of men in general isn't all that good." 

"Well maybe I can turn that opinion around." 

"Yeah. Maybe you can." 

We made general conversation as the miles churned by and I found out all sorts of things about Joyce. Her favorite color was red, she preferred cats to dogs, she had never driven a car and she didn't like pork. Except for bacon. She could eat a pound of bacon at a sitting, but couldn't stand the thought of pork chops, pork loin or sausage. She liked her hair long (and so did I) and would rather go braless than wear one. That is one fact that I was very aware of as she sat next to me. Painfully aware of if you get my meaning. 

We stopped for lunch and I called my brother to let him know I was a day and a half out and that I had company with me. He told me not to sweat it as he had plenty of room. I asked him to check around and see if there were any places looking for a good waitress and he said that he would. 

Joyce took advantage of the stop to make a few calls of her own. She called the bank and let them know that she had moved out and then told them they could keep the furniture and rent the place out furnished or call the Salvation Army or Goodwill to come and get it. She got my brother's address from me and called her cell phone provider and arranged to have the bills sent to Jake's place. Then she called Stella at the restaurant and arranged to have her final check sent to her at Jake's. 

"That's it" she said when she disconnected the call. "No more ties to Harpersville. I sure do hope that I'm not going to regret this." 

"I think that you are going to love it. Everything from now on is going to be an adventure for you." 

"You think?" 

"I do." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

We stopped early that evening and had dinner at a place called – believe it or not – Mom's Diner. The food was good and the size of the servings was awesome. And as if to prove my point that a good waitress could always find a job there was a sign in the window that said "Waitress wanted." 

Joyce said, "Maybe it is an omen telling me to apply." 

"No you don't girl! You signed on to keep me company all the way to California." 

"Yeah, there is that." 

There was a motel just across the street so we drove over and I checked us in. The room was a surprise. I was so used to every motel room I stayed in having two beds I never asked, but the room that Joyce and I entered only had one bed. It was queen sized, but only one bed. 

"I'd better go back and see if they have a room with two beds" I said as I started to leave the room. 

"Don't be silly" Joyce said, "There is plenty of room. We won't crowd each other." 

"That's not my fear girl. You are a beautiful and sexy looking lady and I'm not all that sure that I can trust myself being that close to you." 

"Oh bull crap Rob. You sleep on one side and I sleep on the other and there will be almost a foot between us. In twin beds there would only be three or four feet between us. If you were going to do something one foot or four feet what's the difference? Besides, maybe you need to worry about what I might do. I'm a healthy female and I've gone almost a year without and you are a very attractive man." 

"Maybe I should let you have the bed and I'll sleep in the truck." 

"Don't you dare! Dibs on the shower" she said and started pulling off her clothes. I did mention that she was not wearing a bra right? She turned to face me, smiled and said: 

"Still thinking truck?" 

She headed for the bathroom leaving me standing there with an unbelievably hard cock. I might have read her wrong, but I didn't think so so I quickly undressed and followed her into the shower. When I slid the curtain aside and got in with her she smiled and handed me the wash rag and the bar of soap and turned her back to me. I washed her back and then reached around and started washing her front. She reached back, found my stiff cock and started stroking it. She bent at the waist and picked up the shampoo and handed it to me.  

===

"Use this" she said. "There hasn't been anything but a hairbrush handle in there for over a year and it might be tight." 

She leaned forward against the wall and I lathered up my cock with some shampoo, used some on my thumb to open her a bit and then I put the head of my cock between her pussy lips and started to slowly work it in. She was right. It was a bit tight, but I made steady progress until I was all the way in. She helped by fucking back at me and pretty soon we had a rhythm going and she was starting to moan. The moans turned into gasps of: 

"Yes, yes, yes, so good, oh God so good, don't stop, oh sweet Jesus don't stop." 

She was pushing back at me as hard as I was pushing into her and after about five minutes I felt her cum and seconds later I emptied into her. We stood there unmoving as we caught our breath and then she pulled away and turned to face me. In a husky voice she said: 

"If you fuck me you at least have to kiss me" and our mouths found each other. Tongues intertwined and pushed at each other and then she broke the kiss, pulled back and went to her knees in front of me. Her mouth captured my cock and she began working on me. When she had me hard again she stood up and said: 

"We need to hurry up and finish showering so we can take this to the bed." 

She rode me cowgirl to a second orgasm and then I pushed her over on her back and fucked her hard until I got off and then I fell down beside her and we cuddled together and fell asleep. 

I woke up in the morning with a hand slowly stroking my already hard cock. When I opened my eyes Joyce said: 

"Good morning lover." 

She released my cock and swung over me and as my cock entered her she looked down into my face and said: 

"I love to start the day like this. Do you mind?" 

To answer her I gripped her tightly, rolled her over onto her back, lifted her legs up onto my shoulders and began fucking her hard. Her hands gripped my ass cheeks and I felt her nails bite in as she pulled me to her. I'd already cum twice in the last eight hours so I wasn't going to be finishing in any hurry. I fucked her through two orgasms before I finally got to where I could release. When I pulled out she said: 

"Now I need another shower, but this time you need to stay out or we might never get out of this motel room." 

She got out of bed and padded into the bathroom and I heard the shower start. I lay there looking up at the ceiling and thought about what had happened in the last eight hours. I thought about what she'd said and then I smiled as I remembered that I still had eight days before I actually had to be in California. I got up and followed Joyce into the shower. 

++++++++++++++++ 

At check-out time I debated staying another day, but decided against it. We could always stop early in the evening and it would give me time to recharge my batteries. We had lunch at Mom's and as we ate Joyce said: 

"I guess I'm still a slut. I was pretty blatant last night when I undressed wasn't I?" 

"Did I look like I seemed to mind?" 

"You are a guy. Guys go after pussy. I offered and so you took it." 

"I guess I did didn't I? But in truth I'm not sure that I could have spent too many more nights in a room with a beautiful and sexy looking woman without trying something. And to be fair about it you yourself said you were a healthy female who had gone without for a long time. I just glad you chose me to be the one to end your long dry spell. I need to warn you though. Now that I've had a taste I'm going to want more, but if you don't you need to let me know otherwise I'm liable to take things for granted." 

"Do you really think that?" 

"Think what?" 

"That I'm beautiful and sexy?" 

"Of course I do. Why do you doubt it? Haven't you looked in the mirror lately?" 

"That's different. All I see is me, but I don't see myself as others see me." 

"You can take my word for it; you are both beautiful and sexy.' She smiled and said, "I think I'll stick with you. You are good for my ego." 

We were on the road by twelve forty-five and we weren't ten minutes into the drive when she slid over next to me and felt for my bulge with her hand. "Have to keep you interested" she said as she found my cock and rubbed it. 

"Good God woman. Can't you at least let us get a couple of hours on the road? You keep that up and I'll be pulling into the first rest area we come to." 

She giggled and said, "I guess maybe I can wait that long, but if we don't come up to one soon maybe we can cut off on a side road and find a place?" 

We did hit a rest area an hour later and I did pull in and park well away from anyone else. It was intense! Probably the risk factor had something to do with it. Anyone could have walked by and seen what was going on on the front seat, but I didn't care and Joyce sure didn't either. When we pulled out of the rest area Joyce slid over next to me again and I pushed her away. 

"Stay on your side and at least let me drive until six or seven tonight." 

"Spoil sport" she said, but she did move back to her side. After a couple of miles she took a book out of her purse and began reading it. As I drove I kept looking over at Joyce and wondered at my good fortune. What were the odds of my finding a beautiful and sexy nympho willing to pull up stakes and take off with me after knowing me less than eight hours? With luck like that I needed to stock up on lottery tickets. 

We stopped at seven, checked into a motel and Joyce was peeling off her clothes before the door was fully closed. I laughed and said: 

"Can't you at least wait until we have had dinner?" 

"Nope. Got to work up an appetite." 

We never did get to eat that night. At least not dinner. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

For the second day in a row I woke up to Joyce stroking my all ready hard cock and like the previous day as soon as she saw that I was awake she mounted me cowgirl. When it was over I wisely decided not to follow her into the shower. If I would have we wouldn't have gotten out of the room until noon and besides being hungry from missing dinner I really wanted to get some miles in. I still had seven days before I needed to report in to work, but I needed to get to my brother's place, settle in and start looking for a place of my own. 

Joyce came out of the bathroom and said, "You didn't want your back washed?" 

"I was more afraid of what would happen to my front if I would have followed you in." 

"You're no fun" she said and she pouted. 

I laughed and said, "We can stop early tonight, but right now I need food. I need some fuel in me if I'm going to try to keep up with you." 

After eating we got in the truck and as soon as the doors closed I said: 

"You stay on your side. I need to put some miles behind us today. We could make it to my brother's by nine, but I think I'll stop somewhere for the night and drive to his place in the morning." 

"No rest area stop?" 

"Not today sexy lady. I'll try to make up for it tonight." 

"Well okay, but you better follow through on that promise." 

She took out her book and started reading. We were about two hours down the road when she put the book down and said: 

"You are going to dump me when we get to California aren't you." 

I looked over at her in surprise. "Why in the hell would you think that?" 

"I don't know. Maybe it is because I've never been able to trust men. I'll grant you that you are a cut above the guys I've known before you, but..." 

"Hush up sweetie. You are every man's dream woman. A beautiful, sexy nymphomaniac and I'd be a fool to let you get away. I'm afraid that I'm the one who will get dumped when we get to California and get settled in. Guys are going to flock to you and you are going to be able to take your pick." 

"I'm not a nymphomaniac. I'm just a deprived girl making up for lost time. Sooner or later I'll get it down to once or twice a day." 

I just shook my head as I continued on down the road. 

We pulled into Palm Springs at seven and took a room at the Westward Ho. I called my brother and told him that we would be in sometime in the morning and he told me he was looking forward to seeing me. He also told me that he'd found three places that were looking for a waitress. 

Over dinner I told Joyce about the three possibilities and then said, "I'm hoping I can find us a place close to whichever job you take." 

"Us? You are going to find a place for us?" 

"Unless you don't want me to.' 

"Oh no; I'm fine with it. I just wasn't expecting it. I was expecting to have to find a place of my own." 

"I told you this morning that I'd be a fool to let you get away and I meant it." 

She smiled at me and then attacked her top sirloin. 

When we got to the room she said, "I don't know how things will go at your brother's place so I had better get while the getting is good" and she started shedding her clothes. I didn't have any idea of what the sleeping arrangements would be at Jake and Mary's either so I decided that Joyce had the right idea and I got with the program. It was an exhausting night and in fact it was a night that saw me reach my personal best. Five times! In five years married to Beverly – including our honeymoon – three was the best that I could do. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

We had a leisurely breakfast and then headed for my brother's place. Joyce got a warm and friendly greeting from both Jake and Mary and Mary, being the outgoing and outspoken person that she was, cut right to the chase. 

"What's it going to be? Separate bedrooms or do you have an arrangement?" 

I looked at Joyce and she smiled back at me and said, "We do have an arrangement." 

"Okay" Mary said, "Follow me and I'll show you where you'll bunk." 

We followed Mary down the hall into a room that had a queen sized bed in it. "This is the guest bedroom. The two across the hall are vacant at the moment. We are waiting for a couple of blessed events so we can fill them. Have you eaten yet?" 

"We had breakfast in the Springs" I said. 

"Well make yourselves at home. I have to run to my Pilates class, but I should be home around one. If you are hungry by then I'll whip up some lunch." 

She left the room and Joyce said, "I may have to stuff some socks in my mouth so I don't embarrass you too much." 

I just smiled. 

After we had unpacked I went out and turned the truck around and backed up in the driveway and dropped the trailer and then Jake, Joyce and I got in his car and he drove us around and showed us the three places that were looking for a waitress. 

"Most waitresses get a small hourly base wage and most of their income comes from tips" I said. "How would you rate the three as to the cliental and their tipping habits?" 

Jake thought for a moment and then said, "Alberto's would be my first choice, The Gardens would be my second and the China Café would be the third." 

I looked at Joyce and asked, "What do you think?" 

"I'll follow Jake's advice." 

"Want to do it now? You don't need to go back and dress for an interview; you look great just as you are." 

"You really think so?" 

"You know I do." 

"Let's do it then." 

We went to Alberto's and Joyce asked the woman behind the cash register who she could talk to about the waitress job. The woman smiled and said: 

"That would be me honey." 

She looked over and saw Jake and said, "Hey Jake; you want a table or a booth?" 

"Doesn't matter Alice. We are only going to be here long enough for you to talk to Joyce." 

Alice looked at Joyce and said, "You are with that reprobate?" 

"Kind of." 

"Kind of? What does that mean?" 

"The man with Jake is his brother and my boyfriend." 

Alice looked over at us and raised and eyebrow and Jake introduced me. Alice said, "Take a booth and have some pie and coffee while I talk to this young lady." 

"As we sat down Jake asked, "Boyfriend?" 

I smiled and said, "It is news to me too, but I think I like it." 

I told him the story of how Joyce and I came to be together and he said, 

"Sort of sudden isn't it?" 

"True, but I can use a little good fortune in my life. She's growing on me, but whether or not it is going to go anywhere I have no idea. She seems to like me, but she is young and she is out of what she has considered as her self- appointed prison for the first time in her life. She is eight years younger than I am and she just might meet someone closer to her own age that she might get interested in. I just don't know. I'll just take it one day at a time and see how it goes." 

"Beverly called two days ago and wanted to know if we'd heard from you." 

"What did you tell her?" 

"Just what you asked me to. I told her I hadn't talked to you in months. She asked me to call her if I heard from you and I of course told her that I would." 

"But you won't, right?" 

"Of course I won't. You are blood. Family sticks together right?" 

"Right." 

We drank coffee and ate apple pie and talked about places available in the area and he told me about half a dozen and I made a list so I could start checking them out. We had just finished the pie when Joyce and Alice came over to us. 

"I need your address and phone number" Joyce told Jake. He gave it to her and Alice wrote it down and said, "I'll be in touch" and she walked away. Joyce sat down and said: 

"I think I got the job, but she wants to call Stella for a reference. If Stella isn't too pissed at me for leaving without giving notice it should be all right." 

I picked up the tab and when I got to the register Alice took it from me and said: 

"It's on the house sweetie." 

"Are you sure?" 

"Call it a finder's fee. I think you brought me a good one. Besides, you are new in town and maybe being nice to you will make you a steady customer. 

As we drove back to Jake's place Joyce told us that she liked Alice and she thought that she would like working there. Mary was home when we got there and she offered lunch. Jake and I passed since we had just eaten pie, but Joyce said she could stand a sandwich if it wasn't too much trouble and Mary said: 

"Follow me sweetie. It will give us a chance to talk. I want to know all about how you managed to connect with Rob." 

While Joyce was eating her sandwich and talking to Mary the phone rang. Mary answered it and then handed the phone to Joyce. 

"It's for you." 

"For me? No one knows I'm...oh wow, is it Alice?" She took the phone and said "Hello?" 

"You bet. What time?" 

"How should I dress?" 

"Okay. See you then." 

She handed the phone back to Mary and said, "I just don't believe it. I'm in town less than four hours and I have a job. She wants me to start at six tomorrow morning. Six till two for two weeks until I learn the menu and how things work and then I go to afternoons." 

She looked at me and I shrugged and said, "I told you that a good waitress could always find a job. Now we have to go to work on a few things." 

"Like what?" 

"We need to find a place close enough for you to walk to work or I'm going to have to teach you to drive and then find you a car." 

"I had Drivers Ed in the classroom, but I had to quit school before we got to the actual driving part." 

"I'll put the DMV down on the list of things to do tomorrow." 

We spent the day socializing with Jake and Mary and after dinner we played cards until bedtime. Joyce and I made slow and easy love and nodded off cuddled up together. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

In the morning I drove Joyce to the restaurant and had breakfast there while I made out a list of what I needed to do. First on the list was to find a place. I hit six different places before I found one that I liked. It wasn't close to the restaurant so I added "find Joyce a car" to my list. 

I stopped by the DMV and got the booklet on getting a California drivers license. Actually I got two; one for Joyce and one for myself. I was going to need to familiarize myself with California laws since sooner or later I was going to have to swap my Michigan license for a California one. 

At two I picked Joyce up at the restaurant and drove her over to the place I'd picked out so she could see it. She liked it too so I signed the lease. I paid with American Express travelers checks so I didn't have to wait for a check to clear. They handed me the keys and I told them I'd move in the next day. 

We were in the middle of dinner when the phone rang and Mary answered it. After saying hello she said: 

"No I haven't, but let me ask Jake." 

She put her hand over the mouthpiece and said, "It's Beverly. Any change?" I shook my head no and she said, "Jake hasn't heard from him either." 

"I will." 

"Yes, I have all your numbers; work, home and cell." 

"Okay. Bye." 

Joyce had seen me nod my head no when Mary asked me if there was any change so she asked: 

"Who is Beverly?" 

"My ex-wife." 

"Well if she is calling because she wants you back she isn't going to get you; at least not without a fight." 

Jake laughed and said, "So much for just giving a girl a ride to California." 

We played cards again after dinner and later it was slow and easy love making. After I'd gotten Joyce off and had my own climax Joyce asked: 

"Do you believe in love at first sight?" 

I smiled and said. "I believe that it is possible." 

"I don't know if it is love at first sight or not, but I felt an instant attachment to you when you came into the restaurant. I couldn't take my eyes off you the entire time you were there. I meant what I said at dinner. I'll fight to keep you." 

To be honest I didn't really know how I felt about that. I was quite taken with Joyce and the more time I spent with her the more comfortable with her I became. She said she would fight for me, but would that mind set last? I had been burned before by two women who had professed undying love for me. An undying love that had died. I snuggled up next to Joyce and fell asleep. 

+++++++++++++++ 

I drove Joyce to work in the morning and then Jake, who had taken a day off work, helped me move into my new place. I didn't have all that much to move in. A bed and a dresser for the one bedroom and a desk, chair and computer for the second bedroom. A couch, table and TV for the living room and a table with two chairs for the kitchen/dining room area. I had some dishes, pots and pans, a coffee maker and a microwave and that was about it except for my mine and Joyce's clothes. I was going to have to do some furniture shopping, but I'd put that off until Joyce could go with me. 

I picked Joyce up when she got off work and we drove over to the DMV so she could get her learner's permit and then I drove to our new place. When we got to the door she stopped and stood there after I'd opened the door and stepped in. I turned to see her standing there and said "What?" 

"You have to carry me over the threshold." 

I laughed, picked her up and carried her inside and kicked the door closed behind me. I didn't put her down, but carried her into the bedroom and set her down on the bed. I started taking off my clothes and she laughed and started peeling off hers. It was an exhausting night. Joyce wanted to make love in every room to make the place "ours" and fortunately for me that only amounted to five rooms. Unfortunately I wasn't able to go five times so the bathroom and spare bedroom shared one bout and the kitchen/dining room area shared another. The only room that got a full bout was the main bedroom. Joyce vainly tried to get me up one more time, but I didn't have anything left in me. 

The next morning after dropping her off at work and having breakfast there I hit the DMV and turned in my Michigan license for a California one and then drove over to the office I'd transferred to and checked in with them. I was shown around and introduced to my new co-workers and took care of some paperwork. I told them I'd report in the following Monday and then I headed over to the restaurant to pick up Joyce when she got off work.  

===

I drove to a large parking lot that was two-thirds empty and I stopped the truck. Joyce asked what I was doing and I told her it was time for her Driver's Ed hands on practice. We spent an hour with her driving around, pulling into and backing out of parking spots and then I let her drive us home. She was doing a pretty good job and I didn't think it was going to take much time at all to have her ready to take her drive test. 

When we got home she said, "Tonight is going to be a first for you." 

"In what way?" 

"I've never cooked for you before so tonight you get your first home cooked meal from me. Go sit down while I break in our kitchen." 

I went into the spare bedroom, fired up the computer and sent off some emails to people I knew and wanted to keep in touch with and whom I trusted to keep my whereabouts to themselves. Joyce called me to dinner and I got up and went out to the kitchen. She had made spaghetti with meat sauce and had toasted some garlic bread. It was pretty damned good and I told her so. 

"When mom had her stroke I ended up having to do all the cooking so I'm not half bad at it." 

After we ate we went out and Joyce practiced her driving for an hour and then we went home. I told Joyce to walk through the place and make a list of what we needed or should have to make the place more livable and then I went off to shower. I half expected that Joyce would join me, but she didn't. When I was done I put on a tee-shirt and a pair of shorts and went out into the living room. Joyce was sitting on the couch and she was looking sad. Before I could say anything she said: 

"I wasn't snooping and I didn't mean to do what I did, but who is Boots?" 

"How do you know about Boots?" 

"I went to use the computer while you were in the shower and while I was there an email came in. I'm not all that computer savvy and I was trying to use Google and I hit the wrong key or something and the email came up on the screen. It said, "Where are you Rob and why did you run out on me?" It was signed Boots." 

I thought about it for a couple of seconds and then said, "I guess you were going to find out sooner or later. Boots is my wife's nickname." 

"What does she mean when she says that you ran out on her?" 

"It is what I did. I packed up and walked out one day while she was at work." 

"You told me that you were divorced." 

"No I didn't. What I said when you brought up the white band of skin on my ring finger was that the ring was gone because the marriage was gone and that I was going to California to start over. I didn't divorce Bev; I just walked away. My thinking was that why should I have to pay for a divorce when she is the one who ended the marriage. Let her get the lawyer and pay for it." 

"I don't understand how you could just walk away." 

"It was a lot easier than you would think. I suppose to be fair to you I should tell you the whole story so you can decide if you want to stay here or not." 

I thought back on it and said, "It all started when I was thirteen. The house next door to us had been sitting empty for almost a year and one morning I heard a lot of noise outside so I looked and saw a moving van trying to park so they could unload." 

My memory danced as I told Joyce the story. 

"A new family was moving in and I wondered if they had any kids my age. I'd no sooner had the thought when a car pulled into the driveway. A man and a woman got out and they were followed by two girls who looked my age. They looked the same and I found out later that they were identical twins. Mom and dad went over to welcome the new neighbors and knowing that it might be a while before the pots and pans could be unpacked they invited the new family to dinner. 

"That evening I met Beverly and Belinda. They were exactly alike. They dressed alike, they sounded alike and they even had the same mannerisms. My dad commented on it and Mr. Ferris laughed and said that even after thirteen years he still had trouble telling them apart. 

"You asked me earlier if I believed in love at first sight and I told you that I believed that it was possible, but the fact was that I did fall in love with Beverly Ferris at first sight. I can't explain it and I doubt that anyone else could, but even though the girls were identical in every way I fell in love with Beverly. Maybe her parents occasionally had trouble telling then apart, but I instantly knew which one was Beverly and just as instantly I knew that my heart belonged to her. 

"Over the next couple of months I got to know Beverly and Belinda better and the two of them couldn't believe that I could always tell them apart when no one else could. They started testing me. Bev would ask me to come over and do something for her, but it would be Belinda who met me at the door and then started telling me what she needed help with and I would ask her where Bev was. I'd make a date to take Bev to the movies and when I got to the house to pick her up it would be Belinda who would say that she was ready to go. Not once in all the years that I knew them where they able to fool me like they fooled others. If they had been identical quintuplets I would still have been able to single Bev out of the bunch. 

Over the years Bev and I grew closer and closer. I asked her to go steady on her sixteenth birthday and she said yes. A month before high school graduation I asked her to marry me and she said yes, but not until after we finished college. All was not sunshine and roses along the way. We argued and broke up, dated others, but we always got back together. Bev gave me her virginity the day after her eighteenth birthday and after that we made love two or three times a week. 

"Things were fine until our sophomore year in college. We had a big fight over Bev wanting to go to Panama City with Belinda over spring break. I was against it because I didn't want her to be with Belinda. Belinda had turned into a round-heeled slut in our junior year in high school and I didn't like being around her. I had a part time job and I couldn't get off to go on spring break and I just did not want Bev to go. It wasn't that I didn't trust her; I just didn't want her exposed to the kind of people that I knew Belinda would hook up with. Bev and I had a huge argument over it and she told me to stuff it, that she was going and that was that. It turned out that I had been right to worry. 

"She'd been back a week and I hadn't made any attempt to call her or see her and in fact I went out of my way to avoid her. Her "Stuff it!" still rankled me and I was in no mood to be around her. She called several times but I never took the calls. It wasn't easy avoiding her since she lived right next door, but I managed. Twice I saw her coming up the front walk and I quickly left the house by the back door. 

"She finally cornered me in the Student Union and asked me where I had been and why hadn't she been able to get in touch with me. I told her flat out that I was avoiding her. As far as I was concerned when she told me to stuff it she was kissing me off. She told me that I had taken it wrong and she really hadn't meant it that way. She was just mad because I was fighting with her over going. I let her sweet talk me into going out with her that night and we ended up making love. 

"The next day as I was leaving my first class in the morning Eddie Wooters, who was my best friend, caught me in the hall and asked me how things were going: 

"Okay I guess, but I'm not looking forward to Fisker's class. I know he is going to hit us with a pop quiz and I didn't study last night." 

"I know. I saw you out with Bev. It ain't really none of my business bud, but I got to tell you. I wouldn't be a friend if I kept quiet. You might already know, but I've got to make sure." 

"Sure of what?" 

"That you know about what Bev did while she was in Panama City." 

"I don't know anything about what went on down there." 

"Bev and Lindy hooked up with some guys and to put it bluntly she fucked around on you." 

"You're serious?" 

"Saw it myself. I was staying at the same motel. Bev and Lindy spent five days sharing a motel room with seven or eight guys. I didn't see it happen in person, but the third night there I saw one of the guys coming out of the room pulling up his zipper and wearing an "I just got some" look on his face. I got curious so I went up to him and said: 

"Hey man; I know we don't know each other, but I got to ask you something personal" and he told me to go ahead. I told him that I had been watching him and his buds with the twins and I was curious. I told him that I had been trying to score with either one of them for years, but couldn't anywhere and then I straight out asked him if he was getting any off of one of them. He laughed and said he was getting it from both of them. 

"From the look on my face he must have thought I didn't believe him so he pulled out his cell phone and showed me a couple of pictures. He had one with one of the girls - I don't know which one cause I never could tell them apart – on her knees with a cock in her mouth. Another one had one of them getting it doggie while she had a cock in her mouth, but it was the third picture that told the tale. It was of both girls lying on the bed next to each other and they were both being fucked. 

"Sorry to be the one to tell you bud, but I thought that you needed to know if only for your health." 

"My health?" 

"I didn't see no rubbers being used in the pictures. Could have been and I just didn't notice, but I didn't see any. Anyway, seven or eight guys and you know what they say. When you are having sex with someone you are having sex with everyone that that person had sex with. Who knows where those guys had been dipping their wicks. I was you bud I wouldn't be having sex with Bev until you can find out if she's clean." 

"Too late for that. We got it on last night." 

"Oh shit! Cross your fingers bud and pray for good luck. Got to run or I'll be late for Reynolds." 

"As he walked away I was standing there thinking that I had been right all along and I should have insisted that Bev not go and have been more forceful in saying that we were through if she went. Even as I had the thought I knew that I couldn't have done that. I loved her too damned much. But love or not Eddie was right about my health. 

"I didn't get much out of my classes that day because my mind was on what Eddie had told me and what it meant to me. By the end of classes I knew what I was going to have to do. I was supposed to go out with Bev that night and when I got home I called her and told her that I was cancelling our date. 

"Why" she asked. 

"Because I found out today what you did in Panama City. I warned you not to go with your slut of a sister, but you wouldn't listen and what I was afraid of happened." 

"Nothing happened Rob." 

"Bullshit Beverly!" and then I lied to her. "I've seen the pictures. The one of you lying on the bed next to your sister with both of you being fucked was pretty telling. Anyway, after you fucking God only knows how many guys I'm not having anything to do with you until you can bring me a lab report showing me that you are disease free and even then I'm not sure that I'll be having much to do with you. As it is I'm going to have to go in and get myself tested to see if you gave me any gifts last night." 

"I hung up on her and ten seconds later the phone rang and I hard Bev say, "You've..." and I cut her off with, "Not until I know you are clean and not until I know that you haven't already given me something" and I hung up on her. It rang again almost immediately and I didn't bother to answer it. I knew what was going to happen next so I went to the front window. Sure enough Bev came rushing out of her house and headed for mine. I grabbed my coat and beat it out the back door. 

"I managed to avoid her for the next three days, but on Friday when I got home from class I found Bev sitting in the living room talking with my mother. I wanted to walk right on by the living room and go up to my room, but I couldn't do it. My mom would get after me for being rude and I really couldn't tell her why I wanted to stay away from the girl she knew I was in love with. I joined them and after a couple of minutes of small talk my mom got up and said: 

"I'll leave you two to socialize and go and start dinner." 

She was no sooner out of the room and Bev said, "We have to talk Rob." 

"About what Bev? The wonderful time that you had on break? I've already seen the pictures of that so there isn't anything you can say that I need to hear." 

"Yes there is Rob. First of all I have to admit that you were right. I should have known better than to have gone with Belinda. I knew what kind of crowd she would hang with, but I thought that it wouldn't matter to me because all I was going to do was lie on the beach and work on a tan. I screwed up. I went out with her one night and we had a great time drinking and dancing with all the guys who bought us drinks. I didn't pay attention and I got drunk. I was so drunk that I didn't know what I was doing. I got screwed. I got screwed several times. 

"I woke up in the morning between two guys and as soon as they saw that I was awake they went to work on me and we ended up spending most of the morning on the bed. I'm not going to lie to you here Rob. I liked it. I liked it a lot. I liked being the center of attention and having two hunky guys doing their best to see to it that I had a great time. Of course I know that they were doing it for their own gratification and not mine, but that didn't take away the fact that the two of them were giving me almost continuous orgasms. 

"After that it was a case of not worrying about the barn doors because the horses were already out of the barn and running. I gave in and went with the flow. The thing Rob is that it was only sex. I had no emotional ties to any of the guys in the group that Lindy and I ended up sticking with. All they were to me was what I was to them – meat! All I was to them was a hole to fill and all they were to me were hole fillers who got me off. 

"I said I wasn't going to lie to you and I won't. It is a memory that I will treasure, but it is not something that I ever want to do again. None of those guys meant anything to me Rob. In fact I can only remember the names of two of them. I didn't feel anything about any one of them the way I feel about you. I love you Rob and I want to spend my life with you. I'm asking you to look at what I did as a young woman sowing her wild oats and getting some things out of her system while she was still single. 

"Please Rob; don't let one stupid, drunken mistake ruin what we could have." 

I listened to what she had to say and I believed she meant it when she said that she loved me and wanted to spend her life with me. God knows that I loved her and had since the day I had first set eyes on her. I was quiet for a bit and then said: 

"I can't promise you that I will get by it, but before I even try I'll need to see a clean bill of health from a doctor or a lab before I'll have anything more to do with you. I was tested yesterday and if I test clean and you test clean we can sit down and talk again, but until then I'd like you to stay away from me. I have a lot to think about and it will be easier if you aren't around as a constant reminder of what I'm having to think about." 

"We did both test clean and after several long talks and a ton of promises we managed to put things back together although Bev never did get back to the level of trust I had in her before she went on spring break. We finished school and were married three weeks later. The next five years were good ones and we both found jobs that we liked. 

"The trouble started in the sixth year although I didn't realize it at the time. Bev and I had what I thought was a pretty good sex life. We made love three or four times a week and we enjoyed the many various positions. We did a lot of oral on each other and Bev was particularly fond of anal. Bev started asking me if I had any fantasies and even though I did have a few I was smart enough to keep them to myself. I mean what wife really wants to hear you say that there are other women you fantasize about? And the other side of the coin – what man wants to hear that his wife is thinking of other men while she is making love to him? She laughed when I told her I didn't have any. 

"Everyone has fantasies lover so come on and tell me yours. I can't make them happen if I don't know about them." 

"You couldn't make them happen anyway. They are things I fantasize about, but would never even consider doing because the actuality might change my life in ways that I can't even begin to imagine. What's with the sudden interest in fantasies?" 

"I was reading an article in Cosmopolitan that said that one of the ways to keep a marriage exciting is to satisfy some of your fantasies. I was talking to Lindy about it and she said even if we didn't really do the fantasy maybe we could role play them." 

Oh great, I thought, just what we need; sexual advise from the biggest slut in the state. She and the twit she married were swingers and belonged to a wife swapping group. 

"I take it from this conversation that you have fantasies that you want to live out?" 

"Of course I do and I know you do too. When we are making love haven't you ever imagined you were between those long legs of Marsha Moss?" Haven't you ever wished you could have Jenny Mellman's 44Ds in your mouth?" 

I had. Many times in fact, but I wisely said no. Then I said, "But from what you just said I'm guessing that when we make love you are imaging some other guy's dick in you." 

She glanced away and then just as quickly glanced back and said, "Of course I don't." 

"Am I that bad that you have to pretend that I'm someone else? Maybe you are even faking the orgasms you have when we screw." 

"I said that I didn't imagine other guys." 

"You did and you were lying through your teeth." 

I got up and went out to the garage to find something to do to keep me busy. I was pissed! I did fantasize about fucking other women when I was making love to Bev, but I wasn't crass enough to tell that to Bev and possibly upset her. It wasn't that Bev wasn't getting the job done because she was. I thought about some other women when making love to Bev because of curiosity. I did think about Marsha's long leg because I wondered if they would wrap around me and she would be able to lock her ankles behind my back. I wondered that because Bev's legs weren't long enough to do it. I never wondered if Marsha would be a better fuck than Bev because Bev was great. I could never tell Bev that I fantasized about Marsha and why because it would – or so I believed – cause her to think she was lacking and couldn't give me what I wanted. In other words, it would hurt her. 

What would have happened to her is what just happened to me. Finding out that she fantasized about other men while fucking me made me start to wonder if I was somehow lacking. Was I not doing my job? Was she fantasizing about some big cocked stud because I wasn't big enough for her? Was she pretending to be with someone who could fuck her all night? It was one thing to imagine she was doing what I was doing, but to bring it out in the open was something else. I mean in the one case it was real and in the other it wasn't. Face it. The next time I made love to her I would be thinking: 

"Who does she wish she was fucking now?" 

Those were not the kind of thoughts you should be having while making love to your wife. I was going through my tool box straightening up the drawers when Bev stuck her head into the garage and said "I'm going over to Lindy's." No "Miss me?" No "I love you" just a flat "I'm gong over to Lindy's." I could tell she was pissed at me, but in the mood I was in I thought "So fucking what!" She wasn't home by the time I went to bed and I was asleep when she did get home and she was quiet enough to wake me.  

===

For the next week things were kind of cool around the house as Bev avoided me. I'd about had enough of it by Friday and I was just getting ready to tell her to sit down and that we needed to talk when she said: 

"We need to talk Rob and maybe you should get a beer or have a stiff drink first. "I'll meet you in the living room in a couple of minutes." 

"Sounds serious" I thought so I poured myself two fingers of Wild Turkey, chased it with a beer and went and sat down on the couch. A minute or so later Bev came in and sat on the easy chair. It was 'telling' that she didn't sit next to me on the couch. 

"Rob, you know that I love you right? At least I hope you do. I do not believe that there is another man in the world who could ever mean as much to me as you do. You are as perfect as anyone man can be. But that is my problem Rob. You are only one man. Please don't misunderstand what I'm going to say now. You are a marvelous lover and you have never failed to get me off when we make love, but it isn't enough for me honey." 

I started to say something, but she said, "Please wait and let me finish. You know what happened when I went on spring break to Panama City with Lindy. What you don't know is that I loved it. I loved having multiple partners. I loved having more than one man working on me. When I left Panama City I put it behind me as a one time experience. Something to be remembered, but never done again. But I couldn't. I had to experience it again. Maybe a dozen times before we got married I got together with Belinda and her friends and did it again. 

"I did put it behind me when we got married. I told myself that I had sown my wild oats and it was time to settle down. But it hasn't turned out to be that simple. I think about it all the time. I'm craving it. I was talking to Belinda about it and she said that the solution was simple. Just join the wife swapping group she belongs to. I laughed at her and said that there was no way I could get you to go along with that and she said that I probably could if I worked it right. All I had to do was find out your fantasies and work on them. 

"She told me that at one time or another every man has wanted to have two or three women fussing over him. All I had to do was slowly lead you along with some role play until I had you in the right mood to mention the swingers group. I knew the night that I asked you about your fantasies that getting you to go along was a pipe dream so I'm falling back on Plan B. I'm asking you to let me have one night a month when I can go out and get my fix as it were. 

"It has nothing to do with love honey; it is just sex. You won't lose anything by it and in fact I'll probably come home so charged up that I'll leave you n ruins. I need this Rob. Please baby; work with me on it." 

I sat there stunned and speechless and stared at her. Finally I shook it off and said: 

"You can sit there and ask me that? As long as we have been together and as well as you know me and you can ask me that? Absolutely not Bev!! Absofuckinglutely not!!! You are a grown woman and you get to run your own life. I don't own you and I can't tell you what you can or can't do, but I can tell you what you can't do if you want to keep your marriage. If you ever fuck one any one other than me we are through. Zero tolerance Bev. If you are ever with Belinda and those clowns she hangs with and you flirt or maybe even just neck with one of them and I find out we are done. My position – and I want to make it absolutely clear – is that my wife is mine and no one else's. Are we clear on this?" 

She got up and ran from the room crying. I sat there and watched her go and I was pissed! She cheated on me a dozen times before we were married? I didn't what pissed me off the most. The fact that she did it or the fact she did it and I didn't have a clue. How the fuck could I have missed it? Was I so stupidly in love with her that I just ignored the signs? There had to have been signs. Once or twice I could see not noticing, but a dozen times? 

For the first time since we had gotten married I slept in one of the spare bedroom so I wouldn't have to be with Bev. When I work up the next morning Bev was in bed with me. When she saw I was awake she put her hand on my cock and started fondling it as she said: 

"I'm sorry baby; I should have known better. I don't like it when we argue. I'm yours baby. Don't ever worry about that. I'm yours forever." 

My cock did what it always did when Bev touched it or even looked at it for that matter, and she slid down and took me in her mouth. When I was stone hard she moved up and mounted me and as my cock slid into her pussy she moaned: 

"I was a slut baby, but I've always been your slut and nobody else's." 

She rode me for a few minutes and then she got off me and laid there with her legs spread wide and said: 

"Fuck me baby; fuck me hard." 

I moved between her legs, pushed into her and then fucked her as hard as I was able.. She came twice before did and as soon as my soft cock was out of her she went down on me and worked to get me hard again and when she did she said: 

"I want you in my ass this time baby. I was a slut before I married you, but I'm your slut baby. Treat me like your slut baby. Pound my ass. Fuck me hard." 

I slid my cock back in her pussy to get it wet and then I pushed my cock into her ass. No working on it to get her ready, just shove and go. I did mention that I was pissed right? She gave a sharp cry and buried her head in the pillow, but she didn't try to pull away and after a minute or two she was pushing back at me. It took me a while to bust my nut and Bev got off at least once before I ran out of steam. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

We went out for breakfast and when we got back home I cut the grass and did some other yard work. When I went into the house to get a soft drink out of the refrigerator Bev came into the kitchen, bent over the table and said: 

"Do me honey; I need it. I need it bad." 

I took her over the table and when I was done she knelt down in front of me and cleaned my cock with her mouth. As she did it I was thinking, "She can't have her multiple partners so is she trying to make up for it by getting me to fuck her as much as a couple of guys could?" If that was so I could learn to live with it. 

Three hours later she was in the laundry room doing laundry and as I passed by the laundry room door when I came into the house Bev reached out, grabbed my arm and pulled me into the room. She had me do her on the washing machine and there were some very interesting sensations when the washer went into spin cycle. 

The rest of the weekend was pretty much the same and we had more sex on that weekend than we'd had during the previous three weeks. I wasn't complaining a bit. Things slowed down some the next week. We made love on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday and I thought we had put the unpleasantness behind us. 

Monday at work the boss asked me to run over to one off our accounts and pick up a check. It was close to lunch and I was going to be near my neighborhood anyway so I decided to stop at the house for lunch. There were unfamiliar cars in the driveway and I wondered what the hell was going on since Bev should have been at work and there should be nobody home. 

I knew as soon as I opened the door what was going on because they were that noisy. I walked toward the back bedroom and I heard a man say: 

"Damn she sure has a tight cunt. Her old man must hardly ever fuck her" and another man's voice said, "No matter. We will give her all she can handle." 

I approached the bedroom and reached a point in the hallway where I could see past the door jamb and see the dresser mirror without having to move into the doorway. In the mirror I saw Bev on her hands and knees taking a cock in her asshole while sucking on the man in front of her. A third man was standing beside the bed slowly stroking himself while he waited his turn. 

There we no thoughts of an angry confrontation. I'd made my position totally clear to Bev and there wasn't any more to say. I took out my cell phone and took a couple of pictures although I wasn't all that sure of how they would turn out being that I was taking pictures of what was on the mirror and then I turned and quietly left the house. 

I picked up the check and went back to work I told my boss what I had seen and told him that I would be leaving town. I asked if the company had any openings in other cities as I would like to stay with the company if possible and he told me he would look into it and let me know. That evening as I was getting ready to leave work he called me into his office and told me that there were openings in Toledo, Ohio. Atlanta, Georgia and in El Rancho Mirage in California. I told him I would take the Rancho Mirage slot since I had a brother living there. He said he would start the paperwork and asked me when I wanted to leave and I told him as soon as possible and he said I could take off as soon as I brought Henderson up to date on the projects I was working on. I told him that I could have it done by Wednesday and we decided that Wednesday evening would be when I'd leave. 

When I got home that night I acted as if nothing was wrong. I did have a sick curiosity to see what my Bev felt like after being gangbanged, but she must not wanted to chance me feeling something different so at the dinner table she said that she wasn't feeling well and she went to bed early. 

Tuesday I called my brother Jake and filled him in on what was going on and he said he had plenty of room and I could stay with him when I got to Rancho Mirage. I spent Tuesday and Wednesday bringing Henderson up to speed on my projects and I spent some of the time working on a list of what I wanted out of the house. Wednesday I rented a trailer to be picked up Thursday morning and arranged with a couple of good friends to help me move my things and then I made a couple of phone call and put a few things in motion for my own piece of mind. 

Tuesday Bev felt better and we had sex, but she didn't feel any different and that made me wonder if she had been doing her multiple partner thing all along and that's why she didn't feel any different. No matter. I fucked her and I fucked her as many times as I could on Tuesday and Wednesday because God only knew when I might get laid again. Wednesday I screwed Bev three times only she didn't know that they were the last times she was ever going to get it from me. 

Thursday morning I kissed her as I left for work and then I drove over and picked up my rented trailer. By two I had everything out of the house that I wanted. Before I unhooked the computer I printed off the pictures that I had transferred from my cell phone to it and I left them on the kitchen table with my wedding ring and a power of attorney so she could sell the house if she wanted to. The equity was more than what I was going to take from the bank so I figured that we were even moneywise. On the way out of town I hit the bank and cleaned out all the accounts and the safe deposit box and by four I was on the Interstate and headed west and you know the rest." 

"You didn't even talk to her?" 

"What was there to talk about? I'd made sure that she knew my position, but she ignored what I'd said. Add to that she had cheated on me when she went to Panama City and she admitted to cheating on me right up to the day we were married. Given as much time as she spent with her whore of a sister could I even believe that she didn't cheat on me after we were married? No Joyce, there was nothing more to talk about. She did what she did and it killed the marriage." 

"Did you start the paperwork for the divorce before you left?" 

"No. I figured that I'd let her do it when she finally realized that I was gone and that I was not coming back. She was the one who cheated so let her be the one to pay for the attorney and the court costs." 

I saw Joyce frown and I asked, "Does this change things where we are concerned?" 

"Some. I was thinking of you as husband material, but that idea just flew out the window because you are married." 

"True, but I don't expect that the condition will last forever. Sooner or later Bev will end it and even if she doesn't I can always bite the bullet and do it. The big question is still the one I posed back before I told you the story. Knowing what you know now do you want to stay or not?" 

"That doesn't even deserve an answer. I told you that I would fight to keep you and I meant it. What you just told me doesn't change a thing. It just means that the picture I have in my mind of you sliding a ring onto my finger is one that my mind is going to have to try and delete. No Rob; I'm not going anywhere. You are stuck with me." 

+++++++++++++++++ 

The next six months passed by with few problems and none of them big. I taught Joyce to drive and bought her a used Ford Taurus. After working nine days at the restaurant and learning her way around Joyce moved to afternoons and worked from three to eleven. I was usually in bed when she got home, but she never hesitated to wake me up for some loving. The woman was damned near insatiable. 

Things at my job moved along fine. I got on well with my coworkers and Joyce and I even went out with some of them and attended pool parties and barbecues at their homes. 

Bev called Jake about once a week to see if he'd heard from me and he always told her no. Then what I realized was inevitable finally happened. I got home from work one afternoon and when I got out of my pickup the door of a parked car opened and Bev stepped out. She was between me and the door so there was no way to avoid her. She walked up to me and I knew her well enough to know what to expect and I caught her wrist when her hand was about six inches from my face. I squeezed hard and saw the grimace of pain on her face. 

"What the hell are you doing here Beverly? The way I left should have told you that I never wanted to see you again." 

I let go of her wrist and then stepped back in case she wanted to try again and she said: 

"Yes, you left you asshole and I want to know why." 

"You know full well why. I left the photos on the kitchen table for you to see when you got home." 

"Screw a bunch of pictures. Why didn't you talk to me?" 

"About what? The night you told me that you wanted me to let you go out one night a month and fuck around I told you were I stood on that nonsense. You knew going into your little fuckfest what my reaction was going to be if I caught you fucking around so why are you here wasting my time?" 

"That wasn't me you took pictures of Rob; that was Belinda." 

"Nice try Beverly, but you forget that I've always been able to tell the two of you apart." 

"Bullshit Rob! You can tell us apart when the three of us are together or you are in the physical presence of one of us. There has to be physical proximity in order for you to tell us apart." 

She pulled an envelope out of her purse and took something out of it and handed it to me. It was a picture of Belinda and Beverly standing next to each other. 

"Which one is me Rob?" 

Of course I couldn't tell and she knew it. 

"That was Lindy you saw and took pictures of and not me and if you would have walked into the room and into Lindy's physical presence you would have known it right away." 

"That of course brings up the question of how you know that I didn't go into the room." 

She gave me an exasperated look and said, "Duh!! Lindy told me. She, Danny, Phil and Sam said that they never saw you the entire time they were there." 

"On a first name basis with the three guys?" 

"I've spent enough time with Lindy to know who she hangs with." 

"What was Belinda doing in our house with her boyfriends?" 

"She had a bug problem at her place and a company was there fumigating. She couldn't stand the smell of the chemicals so she called me and asked if she could use our place until they were done. I knew you wouldn't be home for hours so I told her it would be all right." 

"So why are you here Beverly?" 

"To drag your ass back home where you belong." 

"Not going to happen. I've put you behind me and I see no reason to change my life now." 

"Damn it Rob; I love you and I want you home with me." 

"But not enough to keep your legs closed to other men." 

"God damn it Rob, I told you that it was Lindy and not me that you saw." 

"Maybe it wasn't you fucking Danny, Phil and Sam that day, but you did fuck Danny, Phil and Sam and you know it." 

She started to deny it and I said, "Save your breath Beverly. I knew that this day was going to come sooner or later and so I prepared for it. I hired a detective agency to watch you for a week and they also wired the house with survielence cameras. I left on Thursday. Thursday night you called Belinda and told her that I was gone and told her about the pictures I had left on the table. Then you said, and this is verbatim from the tape: 

"He'll be back in a couple of days, but right now would be a good time for me to sample some of that cock you are always pushing me to try without me having to sneak around to do it. We don't have to wait for that fake Tupperware party that we set up for Monday." 

"You sampled Danny, Phil, Sam and three other guys Friday, four guys on Saturday and another four on Sunday. In the week that the private detectives were on you you fucked fourteen different men. You can deny it all you want Beverly, but I have the detective's report and the audio and visual proof. And don't give me any of that bullshit that I was gone and you were lonely and pissed off. I wasn't even gone eight hours and you were setting up your little fuckfest. Also we wouldn't want to forget that even if I hadn't left you had already planned on cheating on me at that fake Tupperware party." 

"You knew all along that it was Lindy?" 

"No I didn't. I didn't know until a week later when the private detectives gave me all the taped phone conversations between you and Belinda. Face it Beverly; your marriage was over the minute you told me you wanted me to give you one night a month to fuck around on me. You wasted a trip in coming here Beverly. Just go home, get an attorney and get yourself a divorce. Make it for irreconcilable differences and without me fighting it it should go straight through in no time. You got the house and it is worth more than what I took from the bank Keep it simple and there won't be any problems. Try to get cute and I'll countersue for adultery and let everyone you know and work with see the video I have of you." 

I walked away from her and she called out to my back, "Please Rob; it was only sex. I love you and you know that I do." 

I turned and looked at her. "That may be Beverly, but I don't love you any more and I don't want anything to do with you. Goodbye!" 

I went into the apartment and closed the door behind me.

EPILOG 

Beverly returned home, got a lawyer and did get a divorce. As a parting shot at me she didn't use irreconcilable differences, but used abandonment as a reason. She didn't ask for anything so I didn't raise a stink over it with her. 

Bev continued to party with her sister until Belinda turned up positive with HIV. Beverly stopped partying and since she played with the same crowd that Belinda had played with she now sits at home waiting to see if she also has the virus. 

Two days after hearing that the divorce was final Joyce and I were married in a simple civil ceremony with Jake, Mary and Alice as witnesses. 

At work I did well and I was promoted twice. After three years I was made regional director and have eleven offices in three states under me. 

Joyce did well at the restaurant. After a year she was moved to days and a year after that she was made manager after Alice decided that it was time for her to get away from the place and travel. She had to cut short her world tour and come back and run the place when Joyce had her babies. Yes, babies. She had twins, a boy and a girl. They are fraternal and not identical for which I gave thanks. No way I wanted to go through what Beverly and Belinda's parents went through.  

===

Joyce went back to work after she gave birth since there was a day care center a block down from the restaurant. After Joyce went back to work Alice offered to sell Joyce the place so she could get back to her world tour. The financing was arranged and we took ownership six months after the birth of Dennis and Darlene.
