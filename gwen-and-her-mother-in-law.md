I recently posted a story (see Vickie, The Baby and Me) with alternative endings and as I had predicted the feedback was both good and bad and the break down was pretty close to what I had predicted. - 9 got on me about grammar, structure, punctuation and the like. - 4 said, "You suck" or other words that meant the same thing. - 7 suggested other possible ends, but too me the big surprise was, - 26 loved the idea of alternative endings and they asked me to do it again. 

So, in keeping with my desire to satisfy my public I have decided to give the poor misguided fools what they say they want. Once again I add the disclaimer: I write for my own enjoyment and then I offer to share. Whether you like the story or hate it know that I have satisfied my target audience - me! That said, I give you 

Gwen and Her Mother in Law 

Gwen and I met in college. The meeting was not an auspicious one and anyone seeing it would never in a million years have suspected that one day we would be man and wife. It was in the college bookstore at the beginning of the spring term. The last item on my list was the Managerial Economics text. There was only one copy left on the shelf and as I was reaching for it some one else saw that it was the last copy and they lunged forward and tried to beat me to it. The person bumped into me and bounced off (at 6'4' and 220 I can be a bit immovable) and into a stack of textbooks. The person fell to the floor and the stack of books fell on top of the person. 

I looked down and saw an extremely good-looking redhead looking up at me and shooting daggers at me with her eyes. I took the book off the shelf, dropped it into my cart and then I offered the girl my hand. She swatted it away and said, "Stupid clumsy oaf" as she picked herself up off the floor. That torqued me off since it was her own behavior that had caused the problem in the first place so I responded with, "Dumb ignorant bitch" and then I headed for the check out stand. 

Two days later the Managerial Economics class met for the first time and three or four minutes into the class someone rushed in, mumbled "Sorry I'm late" and headed for the only empty seat in the room which just happened to be right next to me. I looked over and saw that it was the redhead and she saw and recognized me at the same time. Her eyes flashed and she mouthed "Stupid oaf" and I mouthed "Dumb bitch" right back at her and then we proceeded to ignore each other. 

Life being the perverse thing that it is the redhead (her name turned out to be Gwen) and I, along with two others, were assigned to work together on a class project. That meant time together after class or before class as the four of us worked on the project. By the fourth week of class Gwen and I were being civil to each other and by mid-term we were dating. By finals we were sharing a bed. Gwen went home over summer break and I stayed in Ann Arbor and worked for Jiffy Lube. 

Three weeks after Gwen went home for the summer she called me and gave me the good news. 

"I'm pregnant Brian. What are we going to do?" 

"What do you want to do?" 

"Oh no Brian, you can't just dump this on me." 

"Sure I can. It is your body and you get to make the decisions where it is concerned. You have options. You can keep it, you can have it and put it up for adoption, or you can go the abortion route. It is your choice not mine. I, on the other hand, have no choice. I fathered the child so it is my responsibility. I need to marry you and give the child a name, but even there you have a choice. You can choose to marry me or not. All I can tell you is that you are not in this alone - I'm here for you whatever you decide." 

In the end Gwen decided to keep the baby and I flew to Racine and we were married in a civil ceremony. A month later Gwen had a miscarriage and somehow, even though we stayed married nothing ever seemed right between us after that. You couldn't put a finger on it, we seemed to be a happily married couple, but there just seemed to be something that just wasn't right. 

We both finished college and got on with life. I ended up in sales and Gwen went into advertising. Gwen and her family were estranged. They were religious people and Gwen getting pregnant before marriage drove them nuts so she didn't object when I said I wanted to settle in Michigan close to my family. We worked hard, saved our money, bought a house and lived the so-called middle class dream. 

In a way it was good for Gwen because she hit it off with the women in my family and they got Gwen involved in all the family functions that seemed to delight the female side of my family. The women in my family had the market cornered on so-called 'suburban sales.' My mother sold lingerie and adult novelties and between my sisters and aunts they sold everything else. Amway, Avon, Tupperware, Mary Kaye; you name it and one of the women in my family sold it. In addition to selling Avon my sister Anne held wine-tasting parties and pushed a wine of the month club. My sister Mary had a tie with some clothing company and sold their line and my sister Joyce sold Tupperware. 

Between all of them there was always a party or a demonstration going on and Gwen got drug along to most of them. I didn't much give it a second thought because I had been exposed to it since I was a little kid. It seemed like I was always being sent to bed early because mom or one of her sisters was throwing an Avon party or some such. In addition to all of that there were other family functions going on all the time as cousins, nieces and the like were having bridal showers, baby showers, bachelorette parties and birthday parties. Again, I thought nothing of it because that stuff had always been part of my life. It was like background noise that always had been there so you learned to tune it out. 

One day my mother called me and asked me to meet her for lunch. We ordered and then she asked, "Is everything all right with you and Gwen?" 

"I guess so. I don't have any reason to think otherwise. Why?" 

"I'm just wondering if I'm going to be seeing grandbabies any time soon." 

"I don't know. It isn't anything that we've talked about. She was pretty down in the dumps after she lost the last one. She might not be ready to try again or for that matter she may not even want to try again." 

"What about you, aren't you interested?" 

"No, not really. If Gwen wants kids we will have kids and if she doesn't, we won't." 

"You do know that your father is concerned about carrying on the family name don't you? Your sisters can give us plenty of grandbabies, but only you can produce a male heir." 

"All I can say is that it is Gwen's body, not mine, and if she chooses not to use it to make babies that is her choice. Besides, even if she decides to have children there is no guarantee that she'll have a boy." 

"Well, that may be, but for your father's piece of mind would you at least discuss it with Gwen?" 

I did discuss it with Gwen and she told me that she was not ready to have another pregnancy and she didn't know when, or even if, she would ever want one. "How do you feel about it? Are you hot for a male heir?" 

"No honey, my position hasn't changed. It is your body, not mine. Babies or no babies is strictly up to you." 

"Well I don't want them now." 

"Fine honey, no problem." 

For the next three years every couple of months my mom would ask me if Gwen was ready to be a mother yet and all I could tell her was that I didn't know. 

"Well damn it Brian, she's your wife and you should have some say in the matter." 

"I do have a say in it mother and what I say is that it is her body, not mine. If she does not want to have children it is her choice." 

One night at my Uncle Al's birthday party I had enough to drink to give me the 'dutch courage' I needed to talk to my father about the male heir situation. 

"I don't give a rat's ass if the name gets carried on or not. It isn't like we are the offspring of kings. God knows there are already enough Smiths in the world. It is your mother who is all hot and bothered about carrying on the family name although for the life of me I can't figure out why. Granted, we have been here since the Revolutionary War, but so have a lot of other people. Your Uncle Wendell tried to do a family tree once and as near as he was able to determine your great great great great, well never mind that. I forget how many greats is there, but what he found is the beginning of our line was either born out of wedlock to an indentured servant girl or out of wedlock to a girl who worked in a Baltimore brothel and there hasn't been anyone of note in the line since then. 

Then things started going bad between Gwen and me. My fault mostly because I couldn't, or wouldn't, tell my mother to leave Gwen the hell alone as far as babies were concerned. Gwen would come home and tell me about how my mother was hounding her to have babies and I didn't do anything about it; I just let it go in one ear and out the other. One night I finally got pissed, but at the wrong person and I yelled at Gwen instead of going after my mother. 

"Just tell her you don't want any god damned babies for Christ's sake. Just fucking tell her that it your body not hers and that if she wants a male heir so fucking bad to have it her self. If you don't want to do that then just stop going to places where she will be. Just stay away from her." 

Gwen did not take kindly to that and things got a bit frosty around our house for a couple of weeks. 

Another six months went by and then one night Gwen came home and told me to sit down, that she had something to tell me. I just knew that it was going to be something about my mother again so I already had a scowl on my face when I sat down. 

"I went to the doctor today. I'm pregnant." 

"Oh honey, that's great news." 

"No, it isn't, it is the worst news I could possibly get." 

"Why would you say that?" 

"Because the baby isn't yours Brian. Not only isn't it yours, it is probably going to be black." 

For a minute I just sat there and stared at her and then I said, "Should I bother asking for an explanation or should I just throw your ass out?" 

She got up and said, "I know you well enough Brian to know that you won't believe what I say so I'm not going to waste my time" and she started to walk out of the room. 

"Damn it Gwen, you can't tell me what you just told me and then get up and walk away." 

She turned back to me, "Okay Brian. Here it is. Your mother drugged me, got me gangbanged so I'd get pregnant, only she didn't stick around to see the total outcome. She left before one of the guys called a buddy and the buddy showed up with five black guys." 

"You expect me to believe that shit?" 

"No Brian, I already told you that I knew you wouldn't believe it. And since I'm on a roll now I'll tell you a few more things about your family that you won't believe. Things that should have been said long ago, but that I couldn't say because you wouldn't have believed me then either and all it would have done would have been to make our relationship even worse than it has been. 

"Did you know that three out of every four lingerie and adult novelty parties that your mother has are held at stag parties and bachelor parties? Did you know that your mother and all your sisters model that sexy and mostly see-thru lingerie? And yes, before you ask I did it too. I let your mother talk me into it. Here is the real shocker Brian; did you know that lingerie isn't the only thing that your mother and sisters sell at those parties? I didn't even find out about that part until a couple of months ago and when I did find out I told your mother that I wasn't going to do any more lingerie parties with her and your sisters. 

"Your mother panicked; she was afraid I'd blow the whistle on what they were doing and so she got the bright idea of getting me gang fucked. She figured that I'd keep quiet to keep you from finding out. She even set me up to get pregnant thinking that I would let you think it was yours if it happened. Well, she was half-right. I never would have told you about the gangbang but no way I'm going to stick you with a kid that isn't yours." 

"Back up there Gwen. What did you mean when you said that lingerie wasn't all that was sold at those parties?" 

"You really want to know?" 

"Damned right I do. If you are going to accuse members of my family of shit I want to hear you say what they did." 

"Okay Brian, you got it. Joyce gives blow jobs for a hundred bucks a pop. Mary gets a hundred for a straight fuck and two fifty for a double penetration. Your mother's specialty is anal sex, but I don't know how much she gets for it." 

"Have you lost your mind Gwen. You think that giving the women in my family a black eye will detract attention from your cheating ass?" 

"Obviously it won't detract you Brian, but then I said at the start that you wouldn't believe me." 

She turned and left the room and I just sat there shaking my head and thinking just how stupid did she think I was. I got my answer real quick - stupid enough not to know that she was fucking around on me behind my back. Then I had a thought and I got up and followed Gwen to our bedroom. She was cleaning out drawers and piling stuff on the bed. 

"What are you doing?" 

"Getting my stuff out so I can pack." 

"Why? We need to talk about this Gwen." 

"I did, but according to you I'm a liar." 

"One question. How can you be sure that it isn't my kid?" 

"Because I always wear my diaphragm when we make love. I still hadn't made up my mind as to whether or not I wanted to have children. I suppose that the baby could be yours because diaphragms aren't one hundred percent guaranteed any more than condoms are, but what are the odds Brian? The doctor set the time of conception give or take a couple of days and I didn't make love to you for a week after the gangbang. So, what are the odds that the diaphragm that worked just fine for the last two years would fail in the few days prior to the gangbang? A million to one? I wasn't wearing my diaphragm that night when it happened." 

"Why not?" 

"Ask your mother and your sister Joyce." 

"Why should I ask them?" 

"Just go away Brian. I'll be out of here before the sun sets tomorrow. Until then just go away and leave me alone." 

"I still don't understand why you are packing. We haven't talked this out yet." 

"What are you Brian, fucking brain dead? I'm knocked up with a kid that isn't yours and you don't believe me when I tell you what happened. I will not live with a man who thinks I lie and who just knows in his heart that I cheated on him. I won't live with a man who doesn't trust me. Just think about this. I could have kept my mouth shut until the baby was born and if it was white I could have stuck you with it, but I didn't. Now get out of here and leave me alone." 

True to her word she was gone the next day when I got home from work. She never said where she was going or what she was going to do, she just left. 

"Good riddance is all I can say" was my mothers response to Gwen's leaving. "I never liked her. I knew she was cheating on you and that was the real reason she wouldn't give you a baby. She was afraid that it wouldn't look anything like you." 

"You knew she was cheating on me? And you never told me?" 

"What would have been the point? You loved her so you probably wouldn't have believed me anyway and all it would have done was to mess up our relationship. I mean I knew, but I didn't have any proof." 

"How could you have known and not have proof?" 

"It's a woman thing dear. We just know about things like that." 

Five months after Gwen left I was served with divorce papers. I tossed them in the trash and didn't bother to contest it. Two weeks later I came home from work and found a package waiting for me. I opened it and found videotape with a note taped to it. The note said: 

"I've known you for years and never realized you were a shit head. You did not do right by your wife and you let her get away. I've been out of the country for six months or I would have given this to you sooner. You aren't going to like what you see and for more reasons than just one. I swiped this tape from the guy who made it and made a copy before putting it back. They laced that poor girls drinks with a mixture of Super K and Ecstasy. She never had a chance. I'm not signing this because I don't want a piece of paper like this around with my name on it, but if you think on it you can figure it out." 

The tape was most definitely an eye opener, at least where my family was concerned. It started out innocently enough with my mother, sisters and Gwen modeling lingerie for maybe twenty guys. There was a lot of whistling and shouts of "take it off, take it off" but all the women did, at least for the first twenty minutes or so was model the lingerie. I saw men handing the women drinks. Twice near the beginning of the six-hour tape I saw Gwen dump hers out. 

Then it got raunchy. Joyce was in the middle of the room modeling a bra, panty and teddy set and some guy hollered at her and she stuck out her hand. He got up and went to her and handed her a bill. She tucked the bill in her waistband and then took off the teddy and the bra. That opened the floodgates and money was being handed out and clothes were coming off and soon all the women were naked - except for Gwen. Guys kept pushing money at her and she kept shaking her head no. She did take the drinks that they kept handing her. 

You want a shock to your system? Watch your forty-eight year old mother give lap dances while wearing only a pair of high heels. And then watch your sisters do the same dressed the same way. Joyce was the first to give it up. I saw a guy hand her some money and she took it, walked him over to a chair, sat him down, knelt down in front of him and started to suck his cock. Annie was next. Two guys picked her up and laid her down on a table and started fucking her. The camera panned the room and I saw Mary on her knees on a table while one guy fucked her from behind and another fed cock into her mouth. My mother was on her knees with her head on a rolled up and her ass stuck up in the air for the guy who was fucking it and a line was forming behind him of guys waiting their turn. 

The camera kept panning the action and several times it picked up Gwen, dressed in her street clothes, holding a drink and looking nervous. I watched my mother and sisters perform sexual acts that I'd never even thought about and I would be lying if I said that I didn't get turned on. I actually had my cock in my hand and was stroking it as I watched Anne take on three guys at once. I wondered if her husband knew what she did. For that matter, did Mary's husband and Joyce's fianc‚e know? And what about my dad. Did he have any idea what my mother was doing? 

Suddenly the camera broke away from a shot of Mary taking a cock in her ass while she sucked on another one and moved to show three men walking Gwen to a table. She was obviously out of it. Two men held her up while the third undressed her and then they pushed her back on the table and the guys started lining up on her. The camera stayed on her while four guys took a turn. She just laid there like a blow up sex doll and the camera finally moved away from Gwen and panned over to Joyce. She was taking on three men, one in each hole. Then it moved to my mother who was being worked over by two. 

Do you have any idea how weird it can be to watch your own mother take on two guys and listen to her beg for them to fuck her harder, push it in deeper and to make her cum? I guess it makes me a weirdo when I have to admit that she looked pretty damn good and that I had my cock in my had and was whipping it pretty hard while I watched. The man in her mouth finished and another man stepped up and she waved him away and told him she had something to do first and that she'd get back to him. To the guys pushing into her from behind she said, "Hurry baby, cum in me, do it for me baby, come on."  

===

When he finished and pulled out she got up and went over to Joyce who had just finished off the guy she was working on and then the two of them walked over to where Gwen was being gangbanged. They stood and watched until the man fucking her had cum and when he pulled out my mother held Gwen's legs open while Joyce pulled out her diaphragm. 

"I'll get this bitch pregnant whether she wants it or not." 

"But it won't be Brian's" Joyce said. 

"Doesn't matter, he won't know. He'll think its his." 

"What if it's a girl?" 

"Then I'll breed the bitch again and keep on breeding her until she gives us a boy." 

"What if she tells Brian?" 

"No way she'll tell him about this and even if she did do you think he would believe it? His own mother?" 

Joyce and my mother walked away and another man mounted Gwen. For the next hour the camera bounced around from woman to woman and by the end of that hour Gwen was coming out from under the influence of whatever they had put in her drinks and while her mind might not have been in it her body sure was. She started clutching and grabbing at the men who fucked her, trying to pull them closer. Anne and Mary got dressed and left and shortly after that my mother got ready to leave. 

"She that she gets home" she said to Joyce and then she left. 

With the departure of the three women all the men moved to the remaining two and after half an hour Joyce told them that she had had enough and she started getting dressed. Now all the men concentrated on Gwen and I watched and listened as she was used in all three holes and as she begged for it. The camera cut away from Gwen being triple dicked and moved to show five young black men coming into the room. They walked over to where Gwen was being fucked and one of the blacks said to the guy who had his cock in Gwen's mouth, "Thanks for the call man. I ain't never had me no white pussy before" and then he and the other four blacks began taking off their pants. Joyce ran over and told them that they couldn't fuck Gwen and to stay away from her. The five men ignored her and when she tried to physically push them away two grabbed her, took her over to the door and pushed her outside. 

Once again my reaction isn't what it should have been. I got turned on by the black on white as the man sank his cock into Gwen. Then the other four had her and when they were done one of them took out a cell phone and made a call. 

"Yeah man, a white chick and she's laying here begging for cock." 

By the time the tape ended Gwen had been repeatedly fucked by twenty-two men - seven of them black. I don't know if any more blacks showed up and fucked her because the tape ran out. 

I ran an emotional roller coaster during that tape. I lusted after my mother and sisters as I saw them in all their sexual glory. I hated my mother and Joyce when I saw them remove Gwen's diaphragm. I wanted to kill the assholes who took advantage of Gwen and yet I beat myself raw watching them do it. 

When it was over and I sat there staring at the blue screen I wondered who my mother really hated and why. Did she hate Gwen so much that she could do to Gwen what she did, or was it me she hated - hated enough to saddle me with a kid that she knew wouldn't be mine. 

Every thing that Gwen had told me was true and I hadn't believed a word of it, but in my defense who would have believed that of their own mother and sisters? The worst of it was that Gwen was gone. I had no idea where she was or if she would even acknowledge my existence if I found her. 

I tried to track Gwen down, but had no luck at all. I checked with her old employer to see if they might know where she went when she resigned. They either didn't know or they weren't going to tell me. I called her parents and got her dad on the phone and he hung up on me as soon as he realized that it was me. I waited a day and then called when I figured that he would be at work and I got her mother. For a religious person she sure knew some pretty ripe language and after sending a lot of it my way she told me not to call back and hung up. I called Gwen's sister Ilene and got her answering machine. I left a message, but she didn't return it. After six tries I finally accepted the fact that she wasn't going to. The best I could hope for is that word would get back to Gwen that I was trying to get in touch and that she would call me to find out what I wanted. 

Another year went by and then one day I got a letter from Gwen. There was no return address, but the letter was postmarked San Francisco. There was a letter and some other papers in the envelope and the letter showed me that I would be wasting my time trying to talk to Gwen: 

"When I missed my period I took a pregnancy self-test and it showed positive. I knew then that I would have to tell you about "that night" if the doctor confirmed the self-test and I knew what your response was going to be and I knew that we wouldn't be together when the baby came. 

"I have an intense curiosity and it killed me that I would never know who the baby's father was. If the baby was black the question would be moot, but what if the baby was white? If it was white I would spend the rest of my life wondering if it just might have been yours instead of that of some anonymous sperm donor. 

"We made love three times between the self-test and the doctors visit and one of those times I collected a sperm sample and took it to a lab for a DNA test. I told them a half truth, that I was married and having an affair and that I wanted to know for sure who the baby's father was. They typed the sample and kept it on file. When little Mark was born I had his DNA checked against the sample on file. Guess what? Remember that million to one shot I mentioned? You are a daddy. 

I've enclosed copies of the original test and Mark's DNA match so you can see for yourself. He's yours Brian, but you will never see him. Make sure that your mother knows that she finally has a grandson, but that she will never see him either. Under "father" on the birth certificate I put unknown and I gave him a made up last name to make sure that your mother knows that Mark will not continue her precious family name. I'm praying to God nightly that if you ever do remarry your wife will give you nothing but girls" 

She didn't even bother to sign it. 

One year later I got another from Gwen. This one post marked Denver. It was short and to the point: 

"I've enclosed a picture of Mark. If, even after reading the DNA reports, you don't believe it is possible that Mark can be yours just get some of your baby pictures from your mother and compare them. You could be twins. Eat your heart out." 

She didn't bother to sign that one either. 

I did take the pictures over to my parent's house and when my mother saw the picture of Mark her hand flew to her mouth and she gave out a cry and ran from the room. She was back a few minutes later with a photo album. It was true; Mark and I could have been twins. 

"You have to find her Brian, you have to. That's my grandson she is keeping from me." 

"I'll try ma, I'll try" but I had already taken my best shot and come up empty. 

Another year went by and I received another picture of Mark, this time from St. Louis. There was no letter, just a short note on the back of the photo, "Eat your heart out." I was staring at the photo of Mark when the penny dropped. The first one from San Francisco, the second one from Denver and the third one from St. Louis. Gwen's sister Ilene was a flight attendant - she was mailing Gwen's letters on her trips! 

It was hideously expensive, but the private detective I hired found Gwen. 

Ending A 

She was cool and calm when she answered the door. "What do you want?" 

"To talk to you and to see my son." 

"How did you find me?" 

"I had a private detective follow Ilene until she led him to you." 

"Well you wasted a trip Brian. We have nothing to say to each other and you can't see your son because you don't have one. I lost this baby to a miscarriage too." 

"But I've seen the pictures." 

"What you saw was your baby pictures reworked on the computer using PhotoShop." 

"You really hate me that much that you would go to all that trouble?" 

"Yes Brian, I do. And I'm sorry that you found me because I had planned on sending you a picture a year for the next twenty years. I'll never forget that you loved me so much that it only took you a tenth of a second to call me a liar and accept the idea that I cheated on you." 

"Some one videotaped that night and they sent me a copy. I know now that you told me the truth." 

"So? If you will excuse me I have a date tonight and I need to start getting ready." 

She started to close the door and I put my hand against it to hold it open. "What about the DNA evidence?" 

"I made that up to Brian. You can do all sorts of things on computers these days if you have the right programs. Now please leave before I call the police." 

As he walked down the sidewalk Gwen smiled. Revenge can be so sweet. Her sister Ilene came into the room, "Is he gone?" 

"Yes, and thank God you were here to keep Mark quiet." 

"He slept through the whole thing. Are you ever going to let him know?" 

"Not ever Ilene, not ever." 

Ending B 

She was cool and calm when she answered the door. "What do you want?" 

"To talk to you and to see my son." 

"How did you find me?" 

"I had a private detective follow Ilene until she led him to you. She should have mailed all your letters from the same city. Once I connected the fact that she was a flight attendant and the letters came from three different cities it was just a matter of time." 

"Well you wasted your money and your time Brian. We have nothing to say to each other and you can't see your son because you don't have one." 

"But I've seen the pictures." 

"What you saw were some of your baby pictures reworked on the computer using PhotoShop." 

"You really hate me that much that you would go to that much trouble?" 

"Yes Brian, I do, and I'm sorry that you found me because I planned on sending you a picture a year for the next twenty years. I'll never forget that you loved me so much that it took you all of a tenth of a second to call me a liar and accept the idea that I cheated on you." 

"What about the baby?" 

"I had it and it isn't yours." 

"You expect me to believe that?" 

"Frankly I don't give a rats ass what you believe." 

"Well I'm not leaving until I see the kid with my own eyes." 

"Okay, follow me." 

Gwen led me into her kitchen and pointed outside. I looked out the window and saw a black kid of about two pulling on the tail of a small dog. Gwen opened the window and yelled out, "Mark, what have I told you about pulling on the dog?" 

She turned to me, and shook her head, "Kids, you can't take your eyes off them for a minute. Now will you get the hell out of my life so I can get back to my child?" 

"Listen Gwen, we nee..." 

"The time for talk is long gone Brian, get out." 

"Gwen, I know the truth. Some one videotaped the whole thing and I saw a copy. I know what my mother and Joyce did." 

"Well whoopee doo Brian. I already knew what they had done last time we talked. I'm just so overjoyed that two years later you have decided that I didn't lie. Get out Brian, get out before I call the police." 

As he walked down the walk Gwen smiled, revenge can be so sweet. Her sister Ilene came into the room, "Is he gone?" 

"Yes, and thank God you were here to keep Mark quiet." 

"He slept through the whole thing. Are you ever going to let him know?" 

"Not ever Ilene, not ever." 

"What time is Mrs. Johnson going to pick up Mike?" 

"She said she would be her around five. Which reminds me, I need to get back to him before he drives the dog crazy." 

Ending C 

She was cool and calm when she answered the door. "What do you want?" 

"To talk to you and to see my son." "We have nothing to talk about Brian and you can't see your son because you don't have one." 

"What about the pictures you have been sending me?" 

"Some of your baby pictures that I reworked on the computer using PhotoShop." 

"The DNA evidence?" 

"Also done on the computer. You can do some amazing stuff if you have the right programs." 

"Any idea at all on who the baby's father was?" 

"No. I loss this one to a miscarriage too. 

"I'm sorry. But we do have some things to talk about. May I come in?" 

"No Brian, please just go away and leave me alone." 

"All right. But first I want you to watch this" and I handed her a copy of the tape of her gangbang. "I'm staying at the Jefferson, room 312 and I'll be there until noon tomorrow. Call me if you change your mind about talking to me." 

The next morning the phone rang and I looked over at the bedside clock and saw that it was seven-ten in the morning. It was Gwen. 

"Just what is it that you want to talk about Brian?" 

"I want to talk about what we are going to do about it." 

"We? I already did it Brian. I walked away and then I planted a seed that will grow in your mother's mind until the day she dies. You can go back and tell her there is no baby, but I know that scheming bitch now. I know that she'll never believe that there isn't a baby. She will go to her grave just knowing that I'm keeping her from seeing him." 

"That might be enough for you Gwen, but it isn't enough for me. My own mother drove the only woman I ever loved away from me. I want to drive a stake through her heart, but for what I want to do I need your help." 

"Why should I help you Brian. You turned your back on me when I needed you most." 

"Get real Gwen. Put yourself in my place. Suppose I had come to you with something bad. Let's say that one morning you picked up the paper and saw me on the front page being led naked from a motel room and the headlines screamed "House of Prostitution Raided" and suppose I came to you and told you that your father got me drunk, took me there and paid for the hooker so we could do some male bonding. You would have laughed in my face and thrown me out of the house. Preposterous you would have said, but would that have been any more preposterous than what you told me? That my mother drugged you and got you gangbanged?" 

She was silent and then she said, "What do you want me to do?" 

"I want you to find a boy that would have been about the same age as our son and I want to have a picture of the three of us taken." 

It was a scorched earth, take no prisoners, burn your bridges move on my part and the only one who was going to get hurt that I didn't want to hurt was my dad. He didn't deserve what was coming, but I convinced myself that he would better off when it was over. 

On a bright sunny Monday afternoon, special messengers delivered a copy of the gangbang tape to my father, Anne and Mary's husbands where they worked and to Joyce's fianc‚e at the gym where he worked out every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I almost backed away from sending copies to Anne and Mary's husbands because after all, it was my mother and Joyce who did the deed. But then I thought about it. They knew what was going to happen and they did nothing to try and stop it so fuck them. 

That night I stopped by my parent's house and walked in to find mom and dad in the middle of a screaming match and I stood looking at my mother for almost a minute before taking a tape out of my pocket. 

"I hate to do this to you dad, but this came in the mail today and I think you need to see it." 

I went to hand it to him and he said, "I don't need it. I got my own copy in the mail today." 

"Then you know." 

"Unfortunately I do." 

I turned to my mother and said, "This should go without saying, but since I want things to be perfectly clear I'm going to say it anyway. I don't ever want to see you or hear from you again." 

It turned out that Anne's husband knew all about what she was doing and in fact, he encouraged her. He was one of those guys who got off on his wife fucking other men. 

Mary wasn't lucky enough to have a husband like that and she came home from work on Tuesday and found all of her stuff piled in the driveway and the locks on the house changed. 

Joyce's fianc‚e walked into the office were she worked and when she stood up and walked around her desk to give him a hug and a kiss he grabbed her left hand and almost ripped a finger off as her pulled his engagement ring off her. 

The biggest surprise was my dad. I expected that he would quietly divorce mom and then get on with his life, but there wasn't anything quiet about what he did. He made copies of the tape and flooded the town with them. Her garden club, all the civic organizations she belonged to got a copy, he left a copy in the mailboxes of all their neighbors and every friend he could think of and all the relatives on her side of the family got a copy and then he tossed her out of the house and divorced her. 

Is there a happy ending in here some where? I don't know, it is too soon to tell. I arrived at Gwen's for the last piece of my revenge - a picture of Gwen, the borrowed boy and me - and I found her ready and waiting. She was fusing over the little boy and trying to make him smile for the picture that I was going to send my mother along with a short note - "I found them." I would have Ilene mail it from San Francisco. 

"How much time do we have?" 

"For what?" 

"I want to take several pictures from several different angles to make sure that I get the one that will crank her the most. When do we have to get him home?" 

Gwen looked at me for a very long moment and then she picked him up and kissed him on the cheek, "He is home, aren't you Mark." Report_Story
