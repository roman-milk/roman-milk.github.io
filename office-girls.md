"No! Damn!" Katrina exclaimed. Hitting keys at random on the laptop didn't unfreeze it. At least there didn't appear to be any damage to the keyboard. "What am I going to do now?" She said sinking back onto the chair. This was the tenth time of switching it on and off; the damn machine still wouldn't work. 

 "Bloody men. They made the damn things that's why they're so complicated." She complained. The phone rang startling her from thoughts of what she was going to tell Margaret about the computer. 

 "Yes. Oh! No it's OK. Sue I'm fine. Yes. This computer that's all." Katrina half listened to the inevitable gossip trying to calm down. "I'm not sure. Well if you think so. Thanks a lot." The offer of help with the laptop wasn't the relief it should have been. She wasn't looking forward to returning it to Margaret in this state but it was dangerous to let someone loose on it. What if they found the photos? That would be more embarrassing than a tongue lashing from Margaret. 

 The doorbell rang. "Hello Jason." 

 "Mum sent me to look the laptop over. Shouldn't take long." He murmured, pushing past her into the house. 

 Before she could object he disappeared into the small bedroom they used as a study. 'What is it with men and toys? They will spend hours playing or watching others play then in the bedroom a minutes too much bother.' She thought. Looking over his shoulder watching his hands fly over the keyboard she realised it would be impossible to stop him if he discovering the sordid little secret. 

 'What happened to the nerdy kid from next door?' She wondered. 'When had those broad shoulders, cute bum and long legs developed? I guess he's just been the neighbours kid all these years. How old is he now? I'm thirty four so he must be nineteen.' She mused. 

 "Mrs Kent?" 

 "Oh! Sorry. I was just thinking. Wondering if it's going to, err, live." 

 "Yea. Funny. Well it's dead. Whatever you had on there is lost but I can re- install Windows and have it back to you in an hour. It'll be a new blank machine though." 

 He was expecting her to be crestfallen at losing valuable work whereas the smile was quit genuine. It was a relief, a rescue; she could kiss him. Perhaps not, especially being from Sue's household. His mother the town gossip would start beating the tom toms in seconds. 'Married neighbour molested my son!' The message would be there but mysteriously couched in Sue speak. 

 *** 

 Katrina prepared just a snack for dinner as Harry, her husband, was out of town on a health and safety course. While lavishing Marmite on a piece of toast the doorbell interrupted this evening's culinary delight. 

 "There's good news and there's bad news." Jason stated. "I'll give you the good news first." He added while leading her into the study. "The system is up and running and all the files, word documents, spreadsheets, photos have been recovered." 

 'If that was the good news why wasn't he smiling?' Katrina asked herself. 

 His hands skimmed across the keyboard. Jason could see he had her attention. "The bad news is I've got backups on CD." 

 "Backups? That's good isn't it?" Her voice trailed off remembering he mentioned photos. Clearing her throat she asked. "I guess I should have made them just in case. Can I have the CD? Jason." She tried to stand tall over him, mustering the authority of a neighbour and a married woman. He sat there looking smug and amused. Over his shoulder she saw the naughty photos of her and her three friends playing in succession on the monitor. In this dire situation they looked so lewd no longer the innocent little games they had played. 

 "The CD's are safe at home. Didn't have a chance to look at them all yet. Very interesting photos though. Would look good on the Internet. I wonder what mum would make of them?" 

 "No!" Katrina interrupted. "Please Jason, just bring me the CD and forget about it. I'll pay for your time." 

 "That's OK. I'm sure the photos will fetch a lot posted on an amateur site." 

 Katrina sank to her knees holding onto his looking him straight in the eyes. "You mustn't do anything with them. Don't show them to anyone. You must promise me. Please! I beg you. It would be a terrible thing to do Jason. You don't realise how much harm it would do to me and the others." She stopped suddenly realising the others shouldn't have been mentioned. 

 "I could promise. I might." He said, looking down her cleavage. 

 Her thoughts raced. 'It's not just me. The others are in those photos too. All the naughty things we got up to. I've got to stop him right now, settle it now. I can't let him go back home with the chance of his mother finding out.' 

 "What. What do you want Jason. What will it take to make you promise? How much?" 

 He reached forward cupping her breasts in large hands. With his thumbs he kneaded her nipples watching them harden. 

 Katrina whimpered. She knew what he wanted, had known it would be this all along, but tried not to think it. 

 "That's a nice dress but it would be better on the floor." 

 "I can't. Don't make me do this. Please!" She pleaded; the poise from being a responsible elder was completely lost. 

 Pushing her up by her breasts he told her. "I've seen it all anyway. I just want to see it in the flesh now." 

 Hoping he just wanted to look, hoping he was underneath just a naughty schoolboy she pulled away from his grasp. She tried to reassure herself that he didn't have much experience of women, wouldn't demand too much. 

 Seeing her stand there subdued gave him confidence. He reached forward lifting the hem of her dress to see the colour of her panties. White sensible knickers and nothing else of interest except what they concealed. 

 For a moment she felt so naughty letting him see her knickers but before it could overwhelm her she straightened her shoulders prepared to tell him off. There was no escaping it. He had her in the palm of his hand and knew it. 

 "Carry on then." He told her. 

 'Oh No. This can't be happening.' She felt so humiliated and stupid, especially that it was her fault getting into this mess. 'Just get it over with. Give him his little bit of a thrill to masturbate over at bedtime. It's just so crude and demeaning. Show him then show him the door.' Turning around she quickly pulled the dress over her head dumping it onto the floor at his feet in some sort of gesture of defiance. 

 "Now the rest." 

 With her face close to the wall it still wasn't far enough away from him in the small room. What did he think of her body now! A thirty-four year old wife couldn't compare with a teenage girl. Hadn't he humiliated her enough? 

 "Turn around. Arms down to your sides." He looked her over not seeing the worn slippers, the only thing she wore 

 "Very nice. The pictures don't do you justice. You should get a professional photographer." 

 "No I couldn't. I." What was she saying? Standing here stripped before this young man discussing photography while he examined her naked body. 'Why do I feel so relieved he likes my body? It's awful.' He obviously liked what he saw and became more afraid of where this was going. 

 "Back down here." He said pointing between his knees. Watching her breasts swing forward as she bent to her knees was too tempting. Jason took hold of them lifting them, smoothing them in his palms, rubbing the nipples. 

 Feeling her nipples reply to his caresses changed her opinion, he was more experienced than she imagined. Trying to think of something else wasn't easy. No one had ever paid so much attention to her breasts and they were enjoying it. From simple fumbling with boys to being married had been too quick. Anyway it was only since being married and putting a little weight on that they had grown. Not huge, just nice. Well he seemed to like them. It was no good the rest of her body was joining in the fun too. Any moment now her throat would give in and start to moan. 

 Guiding her with a firm hand she turned and moved, as he wanted her. 'I'm not putty in his hands; I'm a plastic doll. He's moving my limbs around as though I weren't here, and I'm letting him. Oh! No. That has got to stop.' She thought. 

 Hearing her at last moan out load he knew she was his for the taking. With her bent over the desk he was kneeling between her open legs. Continuing to lick her lips and probe her with his tongue until it ached. He finally sucked everything into his mouth. 

 It was as though he had sucked her insides out. A blaze of fire erupted into fireworks crackling out along every nerve fibre to her toes. 

 Sliding off the desk she collapsed onto his lap where he held her tight while the fire cooled. The chair rocked with her shivering for a little while then subsided. He lowered her to the floor with her head in his lap. Guiding the head of his cock into her mouth he watched her suckle it until he couldn't resist and it was his turn to close both eyes tight and moan. 

 Coughing with a mouthful of come she looked around for a waste bin. 

 "Just swallow it." He told her, while closing her mouth with a hand to her chin. 

 With all resistance striped away she did as he told her. 'The first time ever.' She thought. 'That other thing was a first too. My god! Wow! So that was oral sex.' 

 *** 

 Still naked she wrapped the dress around her and sat at the foot of the stairs holding onto herself, afraid to let go. 'Who paid who?' She wondered. 'At least its over.' A twinge of guilt thumped her between the shoulders knowing she had come so much, enjoyed it too much. The dress tucked between her legs was sopping wet. It was her body not her mind that enjoyed it she told herself. "I had to do it. I had to pay the price. For June, Carol, Margaret and Harry too." The idea still didn't sound right even spoken out loud. 

 "Damn! He still has the CD." She whispered. 'I'll have to tell them. No I can't, I just can't tell anyone.' 

 The phone rang and she looked at the clock. It was only nine o'clock. It seemed nearer midnight. She hadn't made love this early for ages. 'No.' She thought. 'I'm not going to dignify it. It wasn't making love it was having sex. Damn. That sounds even worse.' 

 "Hello?" 

 "It's me. Thought I would let you know. The CD's are safe. I'll call round tomorrow with one of them. You get home about six don't you? I'll see you then." 

 Katrina was too stunned to say anything, just nodded her head; she was always home by six, cooking tea for seven, in bed by ten. He just assumed she would be there waiting when she didn't answer. His words sank in. He was bringing one of them, one of them! 

 Katrina ran upstairs to the shower and when finished headed straight to the washing machine. As she was about to throw it in she changed her mind and took the kitchen shears and cut the dress into shreds. The smell of his sperm was still on it and in her nostrils. 

 *** 

 Next day in the canteen Margaret took her to one side. "You look terrible Katrina. What have you been up to?" 

 "I just didn't sleep well last night. That's all." Katrina murmured. 

 "If there's something bothering you just tell me. We've been friends since school; I know when you're in trouble. What is it?" 

 "I'm in trouble alright. I need to talk about it. I need your advice. I need your help." Katrina said trying to keep a neutral tone in case someone overheard. Looking round furtively Katrina saw there was no one near and told her best friend almost everything. 

 "Tonight then. I'll support you. He won't try anything against the two of us. Well demand the lot back. I'm glad you told me, it's my problem too don't forget. We'll see how it goes then tell the others about it once it's sorted. Don't worry. I know that rolling pin in your kitchen is just for decoration but maybe this is the time to use it. Only joking. We had better get back to the office." 

 *** 

 On seeing Jason at the door Katrina's confidence took a dive. "This is Margaret. Margaret, Jason." She introduced them not knowing where to go from there. 

 "Well it's nice to meet you. I've seen a lot of you all ready but those photos certainly don't do you justice. Who took them?" 

 Margaret could see now why Katrina had been so confused and was even surer her friend hadn't revealed all. He had the confidence of youth and good looks. He was still holding onto her hand and just from this small contact knew she would have to try hard to keep a clear head. "Now you've mentioned the photos, where are they?" 

 "Don't worry, they're safe. It's an unexpected pleasure that you're here. You can help Katrina pay for the first CD." 

 "You said you would bring it over, where is it?" She asked. What had happened to Katrina, she was standing next to her but seemed to have withdrawn into herself. 

 "After payment, that's the rule. Another rule is no surprises. I wont forget this surprise of you turning up, so you had better be good." 

 "What did you have in mind as a payment?" Margaret asked. 

 "I can just leave now or you can start by undressing. No more discussions until you do." He said with a smile. 

 Such was the tone of authority Katrina awoke from her reverie. 'I can't let him go now, not after last night. If he posts those photos on the Internet last night's ordeal would be for nothing.' She fumbled with the buttons on her dress managing to pull it away from her body. 

 Margaret was astonished at how quickly her friend had caved in. Standing with her arms folded across her chest she tried to look defiant. 

 "Please Margaret. Just do as he says. He's seen us naked in the photos so now won't hurt. Please Maggy! Just the dress." Katrina pleaded. 

 This wasn't the kind of support she had in mind but he did look as though he would carry out the threat. If they kept him talking they had a chance and there was always the rolling pin. Sweeping the hem of the dress up over her head she struggled with her hands caught in the short sleeves. 

 "Here don't struggle you'll tear it." He told her. 

 Feeling him close with hands around her was unnerving. Katrina had told her how he had manipulated her like a doll, gently moving her into all sorts of positions, but what else had he done to her. She began to see why her friend had given in to him. With his breath pattering on her cleavage and her neck she couldn't help thinking it was a long time since a man had undressed her. Before she could protest the bra was released with a quick pinch to the catch. 

 A tug at the dress released her long dark hair and with a quick flick it cleared free of her face to see his close smiling face. Her arms were still enfolded in the dress above her head where he held it tight. If he had attempted to kiss her she might have bitten him but he turned his head and kissed her ear, licked it and whispered. 

 "Your beautiful. Delicious too." He told her. 

 The matter of fact tone of his voice implied he meant it. The sensations of his breath tuned her nerves leaving them tingling enough for her to believe it. Opening her mouth to say something in defence he sucked her top lip and nibbled it. Deeply kissing her it felt as though her whole body were being assaulted by writhing sensations leaving her weak. It was as though she were being held up by him, her knees too weak to support her. 

 A hand pressed a breast pulling on a nipple. Her hands were trapped, wrapped in the dress unable to stop him. The wicked hand slid into her panties cupping her there. Not delving or probing just holding it. Feeling the reaction to his hand forced a word of protest from her mouth only it emerged as a whimper. 

 Her arms stayed stiffly where they were when he released them to kneel before her. Pressing his lips against her erect nipples he sucked them hard. Unable to move she had no choice but let him devour them. Having her ears caressed had always been a turn-on, having her nipples bitten was a new addition to a deficient list of irresistible sensations. 

 Completely unaware he had moved her to the sofa she sank back with him pressing his face between her legs. With a finger probing each hole she laid back with trembling legs spread wide, unable to move. With him giving her the same treatment Katrina had experienced the night before, Margaret would understood why her friend had capitulated so easily, once rational thought had returned. 

 Breathing heavily Margaret slumped back into the sofa with eyes tightly shut slowly coming too, still in the afterglow of a shattering orgasm. 

 Jason looked down at Katrina on her hands and knees staring at her friend spellbound, unable to look away. "Your turn. On the sofa." Jason commanded her. 

 She shook her head unable to move. He took her by the scruff of the neck and guided her onto the sofa and pulled her legs apart. Without preamble he dived into her wetness with two fingers another probing her bottom. With lips and teeth he chewed her lips then sucked her into his mouth the fingers all the time teasing her swollen bud. Arching her back she came long and loud. 

 It was Margaret's turn to watch her friend being taken. Hers had been a quiet long drawn out affair whereas Katrina was noisily moaning while shaking her hips into Jason's face. Not attempting to free herself she simply laid back, not enjoying the spectacle and not repulsed by it, just accepting it. When her friend was at last sated she watched her eyes slowly open, disorientated as though waking from a dream. 

 Jason had disappeared to the bathroom leaving the two women to recover. 

 "Have you ever experienced anything like that before?" Margaret hummed the words between pursed lips still unable to regain control. 

 "Only once. Last night." Katrina whispered, her throat thick with emotion. 

 Margaret nodded her head in understanding. 

 Jason appeared before them and knelt. Margaret hadn't recovered enough to even close her legs. She heard the sound of a spray can. Startled on feeling her lips being pulled she looked down to see a hand holding a razor close to her pubic hair. 

 "Hold still." Jason commanded her. 

 Pulling her cramped arms from over her head she meant to stop him but they were still trapped. 'What would she tell Jim?' How could she explain this to her husband was the first thought to race through her mind, not that a complete stranger was doing this awful thing to her. With the razor scraping away foam with curly black hairs she stiffened with fright afraid of being cut. When he blew upon a bare patch it was all she could do not to shiver with delight. She watched in dismay her bald pussy emerge under his fingertips. Smoothing the sensitive skin with a light touch together with puffs of air from his lips brought a whole new set of sensations to an already overwrought body. 

 Without a word he moved over to Katrina who at least had witnessed what was about to happen though it was still a shock. Inner feelings were being reawakened. Throughout the shaving it was an ordeal not to react, not to let go, as she needed to. Having held back it was all the more eruptive when she came a second time in a raucous orgasm. 

 "Another rule. You will call me sir. Whenever no one else is around of course. Now its my turn." Jason commanded while looming over them large and bold, smiling a self satisfied throaty laugh. He sat between them putting his arms around their shoulder to guide their heads into his lap. 

 He watched their first tentative laps around the head of his cock. Both tongues explored it, competing for it. Margaret licked its length while Katrina sucked on its head. As it disappeared into Katrina's mouth Margaret was reduced to sucking on his balls. When he came they were so intent on his cock they were unprepared for his withdrawal for it to spurt come into their faces. Like kittens at a milk bowl they enthusiastically licked him clean. 

 "Well ladies that was a good start. Remember the rules and I won't punish you. You can stop now or you'll wear it away." Jason took them both by the shoulders and squeezed them tight, kissing each in turn. Neither knew whether to cry or laugh, their faces betraying the confusion at what they had done and why.  

 

 

===

Jason pulled one then the other from the sofa to look down at them on hands and knees below him. "What do you say? Thank you sir." He prompted. 

 In unison they said the words surprised at how much they meant it. 

 "Sit up on your bottoms. Knees apart. Hands open on your knees. That's it. Sit there a moment to think about how much you enjoyed making me happy. I won't be back tonight with the first CD after all. I'll phone when I'm ready so make sure your ready for me." 

 Squatting on the floor naked they watched him leave and heard the front door close behind him, still unable to move. Like a deflated balloon Margaret collapsed forward in a heap. Katrina helped her up then untangled the dress. Walking back from the kitchen with tea she handed her friend a cup. Margaret hadn't moved from where she had left her. 

 "Another?" Katrina asked. 

 "Another what?" Margaret giggled. 

 Katrina looked at her then realised the giggle was close to a hysterical outburst. "Don't Maggy. We're in deep trouble and getting deeper all the time. We need help. We had better tell June." 

 "Tell her what? Shall we tell her that we're getting it deep. Really deep. The size of him! There was enough for two of us yet I haven't had him yet." Margaret said looking at her friend with envy. 

 "Neither have I." Katrina said defensively. "You were supposed to have helped me tonight." 

 "I think I did that alright. Not as intended sure." She giggled again. 

 "You had better go. Don't forget to wash the come off your face." Katrina scolded her. 

 With a defiant sweep of her hand Margaret found some and sucked it off a fingertip. Prancing up the stairs she made her way to the bathroom to wash and dress. 

 "I'll see you tomorrow in the office. Drive safely and don't do anything foolish." Katrina lectured her. 

 "Me? Do something foolish like sleep with a perfect stranger. Too late my dear." She replied at the door. 

 "We haven't exactly done it, have we?" Katrina asked reaching for some small comfort. 

 "Oh, I think that counts as adultery. Just ask our husbands." Margaret threw back at her. Seeming to revel in the idea. 

 Watching the car disappear into the night Katrina worried about her. Margaret seemed too wired, too manic. She hugged herself for comfort. How did she get into this? They did need June's help she would tell her tomorrow. They say a trouble shared is a trouble halved. That obviously doesn't apply to a young mans cock.  

 

 

===

Katrina wondered how Margaret would feel tomorrow knowing she would suffer after everything went so badly this evening when the situation had gone way beyond their control. It was admittedly her fault to begin with and as soon as Jason entered her home this evening she had capitulated to him leaving Margaret to stand up to his demands. When she too had given in they were reduced to a couple of kittens purring at his feet. 

 They needed help desperately. They had hoped to settle the problem without telling the other two friends but they would have to be told now and in any case they were involved as much as she was. He had naughty photographs of them too. Carol wouldn't be much help whereas June was an older woman, their office supervisor, with a greater experience of life. She wasn't the type to take any nonsense from Jason. 

 It was June's home they used to meet and play where those dreadful photographs had been taken. The one's he was using to blackmail her and now Margaret. June's husband had died two years ago and the four had met together to cheer her up until one evening they had all been a little drunk and started a game. A naughty little game had started out so innocently where one would tell a fantasy scene from a novel and each would add to it. It had all been just a laugh, until now. 

 The stories often ended up in complete farce creating a lot of merriment and did cheer June up but they had taken it all a stage too far. On Halloween night they dressed up and after a few glasses of wine June had taken photos. After a few more glasses they became more daring. Katrina always found being dared was hard to refuse and June knew how to push each of the friends from working with them as their supervisor. Bending over to show her panties had been easy for they felt it was a safe place to play out silly fantasies or so they had thought. 

 Over the months the weekly sessions had formulated into a routine of escapism with stories being written on the computer together with photos of them posing, illustrating the story. Dressed as a gorilla Carol had reached around Carol dressed as a schoolgirl grabbing her breasts. With a little more wine they were pulled out for the first of many bare breasted shots. Ordering saucy books over the Internet, for none of them had been brave enough to buy one in a shop, they read the stories out loud often laughing at the ludicrous scenes. 

 June too would join in and end up being subjected to small humiliations like standing in the corner with her hands on her head or over someone's knee while they pretended to smack her bottom or serving the drinks with the skirt tucked into the back of their knickers. When a bondage book arrived by mistake things did get out of hand a little when whoever drew the short straw was lightly bound. They were always just a tease but the photos didn't reflect that. 

 June had suggested they pose nude to record themselves while they looked young and beautiful, as a reminder for when they were her age. Katrina remembered remarking that June was good looking for forty-eight. June had a large pair of breasts over a slim waist and looked fabulous in a bustier. Her legs were long and slender and strong from dancing. A hobby she shared with her husband. Somehow they all agreed to strip off for a group photo and from then on it was easy to pose naked for ever more raunchier scenes. 

 Katrina remembered Carol squealing with a mixture of fear and delight when a dildo was held against her pussy. She was tied up for a pose and couldn't stop June from teasing her while she pleaded for her to stop. With tears of laughter she collapsed on the floor with all four of them in a heap laughing. 

 No one said anything but all suspected June had started using the thing, as it was never seen again. Other props were bought with an understanding nothing would actually be used; nothing too embarrassing would be done to each other. Yet it didn't always look that way in the photos if you hadn't been there. 

 Everything was photographed and saved on the computer and now that young man had a copy. Unfortunately it didn't look so innocent anymore when a young man had a hold of them. They looked lascivious, indecent even. 

 **** 

 Katrina made arrangements to meet on Wednesday instead of the usual Friday night by sending emails to each of the other three. Nothing was mentioned, no emergency or difficulties, just that they should meet up. Just in case Jason turned up at her house Katrina drove straight to Margaret's from the office. Over a quick coffee they tried to make sense of what had happened last night and what they should tell June. Carol wasn't even mentioned for they knew she would be a push over and go along with whatever they decided. 

 **** 

 Jason waited outside for the right moment to pounce and exactly on time he saw her leave the house, hesitating to check the front door was locked she turned toward her car. The twenty-five year old woman was slightly built and pretty. He remembered seeing the pictures of her dressed as a schoolgirl acknowledging how well the little outfit had suited her. 

 "Hi, Carol." He said, while raising his hand. She took it into hers automatically. He shook it with a gentle but firm grasp. "Katrina told me to pick you up. Here I have a note somewhere. Are! It must be in the car." He said while patting his pockets. "I'm to drive you both over to June's house. We have to hurry because they're meeting early. Katrina's directions weren't very good and it's taken me time to find you. By the way I'm Katrina's cousin, Jason." He lied, while holding the door to his sports car for her. 

 Carol sat quietly on the short journey wondering what this meeting was all about and why the sudden change of plans. If Katrina's cousin was driving them there and home again it must mean a special evening with a lot of wine on the menu. 

 A little tingle of excitement flushed her cheeks. Under the light raincoat she wore a nice flowery summer dress. Nothing outrageous, except under it she wore sheer stockings held by suspenders with the tiniest pair of panties she had ever worn. The white suspenders and panties were in bright contrast to the smooth tan of her skin. 

 She inherited her beautiful features and skin tones from her parents, who were born in Kuching in Malaysia. The suspense was thrilling too as she wondered which one of them had something special to share with the others, and what was it? 

 "Here we are safe and sound. Katrina practically ordered me to drive slowly for you. Katrina!" He shouted, walking straight into the kitchen while Carol waiting in the hall. "Hi Katrina. OK. I'll tell her." Jason said into the mobile phone pressed against his cheek. He didn't want Carol to see it wasn't even switched on. He smiled reassuringly at Carol with a conspiratorial wink. "She's on her way there, couldn't wait. She says to get changed and I'll drive you to June's house. Does she order everyone around like that or just me?" He asked. 

 "I'm afraid the three of them do it to me too." She said. 

 "Upstairs in the spare bedroom. She's left something for you. Here let me take your coat." Ignoring the ineffectual resistance he had her coat off and hung it on the coat rack. "Hurry up. It's the second door on the left." 

 Holding onto the sides of the dress with both hands she scampered up the stairs taking no chances of showing off the suspenders. He could see the sheer stockings and she could feel his eyes looking up at her from the hall. What he couldn't see was the embarrassment on her face simply from what she was wearing underneath the dress. It seemed so naughty to wear this saucy outfit with a man so close, even though he was young and didn't suspect a thing. 

 In the room she quickly shrugged off the dress and grabbed the garment off the bed. She gasped in surprise. It was a little bunny girl outfit. The tiny skirt was far to short. What was she going to do? She would have to make some excuse for taking it with her for she couldn't change into it while he was down stairs with her coat. Carol wasn't daring enough to wear it even with a coat over it. 

 "Come on we have to go." Jason told her. 

 Hearing his voice right outside the door startled her into a greater panic. 

 When she didn't answer he asked. "You OK?" 

 She nodded then realised she hadn't spoken. "Yes, OK!" She managed to croak. He must have assumed her reply meant he could come in and here she was wearing nothing but this insubstantial underwear. Despite herself she was becoming aroused from this handsome young mans presence. 

 "Your not dressed yet. Come on! Get a move on." He scooped up the dress she had worn to drop it into a shopping bag. It was the same bag he had purchased the bunny girl costume in. It had been easy leaving it here in Katrina's house as his mother had a spare key. She used it when Katrina was on holiday to water the plants. 

 He flashed her a big reassuring smile. He had a right to feel satisfied as he had conquered two of the four friends and now had a third stripped down to her underwear. It had been a well-planned deception where he had practically kidnapped her. 

 "Quickly slip that on and I'll zip it up." He told her. 

 The feeling of humiliation at him seeing her in the naughty underwear was confusing her. Not wanting to face him, unable to ask for her dress back, she quickly pulled the outfit over her head desperate to cover a near naked body. She let him turn her body to be zipped in to it with his hands upon her shoulders. Jason was a large well-built man, well able to man handle her, yet he hadn't taken advantage or made lewd remarks. Still she found his presence overpowering. The thought crossed her mind that he was gay and Katrina had set her up in this embarrassing situation. 

 The spandex top was a perfect fit, like a second skin. He had her measurements from the computer where the four of them had ordered outfits on the Internet. All their measurements, purchases, photos, addresses and more were his. 

 She trembled while he fiddled at her neck. In the mirror she saw a collar around her neck with a short leash dangling from it. What was happening, she had no idea. Was this all a plot by the others to humiliate her? 

 "Here, down on the floor. You have to practice crawling." He told her. 

 On hands and knees she crawled next to him out of the bedroom onto the landing. She didn't see the phone in his hand videoing the event for his collection. The feel of the little hem fluttering upon her bare bottom was so mortifying she kept her eyes shut knowing it was working its way to flop around her waist. This very scene had been enacted in the privacy of June's home where even there it had been almost too much for her, but then she had worn sensible knickers. 

 With this young man in charge it was so much more intense and she was wearing practically nothing between her legs. Carol was humiliated, devastated and turned on all at the same time. The confusion of emotions was so overwhelming there was no option but to retreat into a little world in her mind leaving him to guide her. She had lost control and let him control her body. 

 He looped the leash around the banister and descended the stairs. Looking up at her he said. "You'll have to stand up to walk down the stairs or you might fall. Come on we need to hurry. Take hold of the leash." 

 She stood trembling with humiliation looking down at him knowing he could see up the tiny skirt. It only covered her hips so he would be able to see the suspenders and most embarrassing of all the minute patch of white moulded to the lips between her legs. Looking down at each step she descended carefully avoiding his stare. Still she hadn't noticed the phone videoing the sway of her hips with the pulsation of that white triangle in rhythm. 

 "No! Please. I need the raincoat. I can't go like this." Carol pleaded. Desperation had overcome fear bringing her back to the reality of what she was doing; or rather what she had allowed him to do to her. 

 "You'll be fine. I'll look after you. Now do as your told and get into the car." 

 Feeling his hand gently slap her bare bottom brought a spurt of energy propelling her out of the door onto the drive. Eager to get in out of sight she fell into the passenger seat trying to sink out of view. When he got in she looked down to where his eyes were drawn. She had squirmed down into the seat leaving her legs uncovered to the crotch. Pulling at the hem did no good she would have to put up with it for the short journey to June's house. 

 When a van pulled up beside them at traffic lights she felt so dreadful she wanted to wake up willing it all to be some kind of nightmare. At last they arrived. 

 "We'll just wait a moment, their car isn't here yet." Jason told her. 

 Carol wasn't in a hurry to expose herself to any passing stranger so sat with eyes shut tight and with the small consolation he hadn't touched her much. He was a well-built man and could easily have his way with her, especially as those naughty panties were so flimsy. He had a slight excuse too for she had just stood there in a bedroom in her underwear, letting him take the lead. Her friends would protect her, so it would all be over soon. 

 The two friends didn't see them sitting waiting. They left the car, still arguing, walking up to the front door of June's house. Katrina fished in her handbag for the key June had given her, at last finding it. Right behind them Jason led Carol on a tight leash. 

 "Hello girls." He announced as they walked into the hallway. 

 Katrina and Margaret were stunned. They stood with open mouths staring at Jason then took in the sight of Carol. The cold air had swollen her nipples for them to be displayed like candles on cup cakes, through the thin spandex, ready to be set on fire. They knew how sensitive she was and the slightest touch would set them aflame. 

 "Now we are here you two had better follow the rules. Down Carol." He ordered, with a hand on her head. Carol sank awkwardly to her knees then on to all fours. The young man did the same to Katrina who gave in with a little whimper. 

 

 Margaret watched mesmerised as he strapped a collar around her friend's neck sickened by the way she had capitulating so easily. His smile seemed so all consuming, the struggle to tell him 'No' was lost. She thought at least June would save them form this humiliation. The idea that she was enjoying this was firmly filed away in the back of her mind. Before she could adjust to what was happening she too was on her hands and knees while he fastened a collar around her neck. The three women crawled beside him along the hallway into the lounge. 

 

 'At least the carpet is soft on the knees.' Katrina thought. 

 "What do you think of this then?" June said while turning slowly around showing off a spectacular new outfit. The black latex suit lifted her breasts into two impressive globes. It creased tight between ample cheeks, pulling tight at the waist and between her legs. Completing the turn she faced her three friends. Whatever she was going to add was choked off on seeing her friends on hands and knees beside a stranger. Like them she was stunned into silence. 

 "Your friends have something to tell you. Come on Katrina, confess." Jason told her while pulling on the leash forcing her to look up at June. 

 Still on hands and knees Katrina looked up at her friend who's smile was replaced by a look of shock. While she stammered out a sorry tale of woe about the computer and how Jason had the photos, June looked at her not wanting to acknowledge Jason's presence in their secret playground. 

 He circled the room casually examining the fine furniture recognising it from the photos. On a piece of furniture here and there he placed a miniature camera. At last he stood beside June examining the outfit. She hadn't moved from the spot where she had given the slow twirl. He bent to her ankles quickly snapping the clasps together and stood upright, close to her. 

 "What have you done to them? This has got to stop now young man. We won't submit to blackmail. You will hand over the photographs or I will phone the police." June stated. She was quick to recover but not quick enough. Taking a step away from him she began to fall when her foot refused to leave its companion. 

 Jason took hold of both arms gently lowering the woman to the floor. Unlike her friends she couldn't support herself on her hands as the wrists were clasped to a tight belt about her waist. 

 "What do you think you are doing? Let me go. Get out of here now!" June protested. 

 "So this is the toy box." Jason said. He rummaged through it until he found a large vibrator. "So who wants to play a game then?" He asked. 

 "No you don't. We want nothing to do with you." June told him while squirming on the floor. 

 He sauntered over to her and knelt. "Until you learn the rules of this game you had better be kept quiet. For your own good." He told her. From a bag he pulled a gag and fitted it around her head. Carefully pulling the long blond hair away from her face he slipped it into her mouth while she gathered more words of protest. 

 The muffled shout convinced her of its effectiveness. She at last lay still, exhausted from the ineffective struggle, flat on the floor sucking in air through flared nostrils, glaring at her friends. 

 "So. Now we are all together let the fun begin. Who wants to be first?" Jason asked, with a glint of mischief to his voice. The three women cowered on the floor staring at the carpet not wanting to catch his eye. "Katrina." He said, the single word making her tremble. "You had better get changed from your office attire into something more comfortable." 

 Katrina kicked off her shoes, undid the white blouse quickly twisting each button. Unzipping the side of the black skirt she let it slip to the floor. At a look from him she twisted the white bra to unclip it and let that too drop to the floor. She wasn't to be spared; the tights and black panties were pulled off each leg. She wanted to reach out for the outfit he held to cover her body but cuddled her naked body instead. 

 "Hands to the side girl." He told her. "You arranged this meeting so you must be punished. Go stand in the corner like a naughty girl. Count to thirty silently then place your hands on your head. Count another thirty and put them to your sides. Then start over." He ordered. 

 She nodded obedience and started counting. The others had watched entranced at seeing their friend capitulate to his whim. Who was going to be next and what was in store for them? 

 "Margaret your next. Stand up girl, quickly." 

 She hurried to obey not wanting to be punished, not daring to look at the others. 

 Carol was in her own little world pretending it was the usual Friday night game and that he wasn't there. 

 June lay where he had left her galled at seeing her friends reduced to playthings of this young man. How had he reduced them to this state? It was more difficult for them having husbands to consider but even she shuddered to think what friends and neighbours would think if their secret was revealed. 

 Margaret stood perfectly still with arms to her sides while he examined her naked body. Her breasts weren't large but they were firm and her legs were shapely. At first she was highly embarrassed but he seemed to enjoy the look of her body and was surprised at how much this pleased her. Her mind became filled with thoughts of what he had done to her last night and how much she had enjoyed it. 

 "Lie on the floor face down over here." Jason told her. He directed her until her head was between June's knees. 

 On his knees beside June he carefully unzipped the outfit from the back to her belly. She protested through the gag a meaningless stream of sounds while he held onto her breasts squeezing the nipples harshly until she held still. For a moment he simply tingled her thighs with tender strokes of his fingertips then suddenly sucked on her lips. Pushing his tongue in to explore he felt her thighs relax, opening a little.  

 

 

===

June tried to fight it until his tongue began to wriggle between her lips when her body gave in the struggle. Feeling her pussy opening up to him like a flower in bloom she flopped back on the floor a little more aware of how he had achieved her friends submission. The little groans of satisfaction as he hit the right spot were thankfully muffled and distorted. 

 Pulling Margaret into position he directed her to suckle on her friends pussy. With the leash he guided Carol between Margaret's legs. Close to her friends bare pussy Carol watched with wide-open eyes the young man sucking on the lips only inches from her face. 

 "Like that. Keep doing it until I give you more instructions." He told her. As an added incentive he stroked her nipples, playing with them rubbing them hard. 

 

 Carol felt as if they would burst into flames. She reached up with her face to Margaret's recently shaved pussy and sucked. With that first touch she felt Margaret press down seeking more, slathering her mouth with wetness almost suffocating her. Startled by a touch between her own legs she stopped sucking and licking. Quickly she continued before the pussy above her pressed down too tightly and suffocated her. 

 Feeling her panties pulled to one side was startling but the feel of fingers and a tongue exploring her was shocking. It was a delirious pleasure her body needed desperately after being so fiercely teased. 

 Jason turned Katrina around from her corner of the room. She staggered when her knees went weak at the sight of her friends on the floor. She had heard mutterings but blocked it all out by counting. The three friends were laying in a row with their heads between the others legs noisily sucking. June was on her back with Margaret's head between her legs. Margaret was lying on her stomach with Carol between her legs face up. 

 He guided Katrina down on her friend Carol. With a little guidance she picked up what she was to do. To each of them in turn he gave the same instructions. "Lick or suck where your pussy is licked or sucked. What ever you feel do the same to the one in your mouth." He told them. 

 Looking up at Katrina's clitoris he pulled her hips down. Penetrating her with his tongue she sighed a deep satisfaction. A split second later he heard Carol whimper, then Margaret, then a muffled sound from June's gag. A wet finger penetrated Katrina's brown puckered hole and she nearly came. The gesture went from woman to woman eliciting a fresh round of groans and whimpers. He thought of playing a tune with them but instead carried out a steady rhythm. For half an hour he carried on the game until they were all moaning in desperation. 

 Jason moved from under Katrina telling her to carry on probing with her tongue. Taking hold of her hips he slipped his aching cock into her and with a few strokes she came. The motion of her head bucking to and fro from the motions of her hips on his cock travelled from one to the other. 

 Holding back from coming he moved on to Carol. Lifting her bottom off the carpet he entered her. With the first stroke she was aflame with passion and her head rose up into Margaret's pussy as she came forcefully. 

 He pulled Carol from under her friend and entered Margaret for her to buck and gyrate on his cock so he didn't have to move a muscle. Quickly sated she deflated upon June in a heap. He had to drag Margaret off June still rubbing herself on Margaret's face. Between June's legs he felt them almost crushing him as they wrapped around his middle. Thrusting into her, he rode her hard and furiously now desperate to come after holding back for so long. 

 She cried out a long wailing orgasm. Thankfully for the neighbours it was muted by the gag otherwise they might think someone was being tortured or killed. At last the five bodies lay at rest upon the floor. 

 Jason lay upon the prone body of June in silence except for the thumping of his heart and the deep breaths sucked into his heaving chest. Each of the women, in their own way, savouring the moment, held on to the feelings of satisfaction. 'This is just the beginning.' He thought. Looking them over he whispered. "So where do we go from here?"  

 

 

===

The four women knelt upon the carpet with heads bowed before the young man, each in turn taking his cock in their mouths in a demonstration of their position of fealty to him. Margaret enjoyed the sexual contact making the most of it so that he had to pull away from her. Katrina's embarrassment became obvious as her cheeks blushed and he watched the flush spread down her neck to her bare breasts. Carol's eyes were shut tight as he pierced her lips using her compliant mouth for just one slow stroke. 

 June watched her friends abuse with astonishment; it was their submission to this humiliation as much as the audacious act they were being forced to perform that shocked her. She was struggling to gather the words to admonish this stranger who had invaded her home and her body. The words came to mind too late as his deflated member was quickly pushed into her open mouth. When she found herself sucking it like a comforter, consternation reigned in her mind. The feelings of sexual gratification were kindled again overcoming her natural reluctance to submit to this arrogant young man. 

 As soon as Jason left the house the four friends pulled themselves together, each disappearing upstairs to a room for privacy. June made an effort in the kitchen sink to freshen up. Anger flared inside and subsided just as quickly as she thought about the three of them upstairs. It wasn't their fault. He had seduced her too. Too easily, too completely. Holding on to the edge of the sink she took a moment to wonder at the way he had taken her, taken all of them. It had been unexpected, outrageous, catching them off guard so they just let it happen. She trembled a little at the memory of that powerful orgasm. 

 In the lounge they readied to leave. Nothing was being said obviously wanting to run away from the sordid episode. "Just wait a moment." June told them. "Sit down. We've got to sort this out. We can't just give in to him. We can't just let him have sex with us whenever he wants. Its blackmail, dirty blackmail, and we must do something to stop him." 

 "Should we go to the police?" Katrina asked. Margaret and Carol shook their heads. 

 "That won't work now. We've given in to him and there isn't proof he coerced us. Which is worse, having the photos revealed or continuing with this debasement?" 

 "Why not just play along with him?" Margaret asked. "Do what he wants until we get the opportunity to destroy the photos, then we'll be free. Don't try to pretend you didn't enjoy it June." 

 June was taken aback. There hadn't been enough time to work out how she felt about it, except shame. Margaret had a point, which she didn't want to face right then. "What do you think Katrina?" She said, trying to ignore Margaret. 

 "I don't know what to do about it. I'm sorry June; I tried to get the photos back that first evening. I really did! I shouldn't have given in to him that first time, it gave him such an advantage. He has such a way about him it was difficult, impossible to resist him." She shook her head trying to clear it of the naughty thoughts. She explained what had happened that first evening and the second with both her and Margaret giving in to him. 

 "Good grief. You let him shave you? Both of you? I must admit he seems to know a lot, too much, for such a young man." She said quietly. This was the closest she was going to come to admitting she had enjoyed that evenings sexual escapade. 

 "What about me?" Complained Carol. They looked at her seeing the hurt expression creasing her face into almost-tears. She explained how he had brought her here on the pretext Katrina had made the arrangements. "I can't tell Luke, he must never find out, he will kill me. We must keep it a secret." The others nodded silently each with similar reasons for keeping the photos a secret and now there was the added problem of having had sex with him. 

 "It's not just the photos now. What if I'm pregnant? My husband will know it's not him. I pretend it's my fault but we both know he can't produce children." Carol looked like a young girl sitting there wringing her hands rocking back and forth. 

 Both Katrina and Margaret spluttered tea over the kitchen table. "Oh! No! I hadn't thought of that. It was only this evening that he actually. Oh! No!" Katrina wailed. 

 "Calm down!" June demanded. 

 "It's all right for you. Your past, well you know. I mean." Margaret ground to a halt. 

 "He didn't fill you up, either of you, did he? Well he did me." June stated. The expression upon her face revealed to her friends a secret thought, a thought that had been pushed away ever since she had felt him coming. At that moment she had wanted him and his sperm so badly she was willing to submit to anything. 

 "I'm not passed it if that's what you mean." June glared back at Margaret. 

 Katrina waved her open hand between the two of them. "Listen. Can you get some morning after pills from that friend of yours in the pharmacy?" June nodded. "When that's taken care of we can deal with the photos and blackmail. None of us can afford to let him carry out the threat so we will have to come up with a solution." 

 "In the mean time we do as he says, yes?" Margaret added with a sly smile upon her face. 

 "Yes! We must, all of us. He said that. We must all do as he says. Please! My husband mustn't find out." Carol pleaded. 

 Margaret was forming a quip about being sleeping with a stranger to help her friend out, when June recovered her composure to say. "I could take him on. You three have husbands to consider. I could demand he leaves you alone. Make a deal with him." June leant back from the looks of angry suspicion on the three faces. Even Carol gave her a stern look over the proposal. June dropped the idea wondering at their reaction questioning her motives behind the suggestion to. 

 They hugged and said good night agreeing not to decide anything until after a good nights sleep. Katrina drove the two friends home and reluctantly entered her empty house. On opening the fridge she became aware of a ravenous hunger. With her husband away there was little there, no tasty leftovers. An overwhelming desire for chocolate sped her across the kitchen for the car keys. "Oh! No! Not a craving for chocolate. She relaxed a little knowing pregnancy urges were a long way off. Even if she was pregnant, which she wasn't! She stroked her stomach smiling with the thought of it. Was it worth the risk? 

 *** 

 Waddling into the prenatal clinic a nurse asked Katrina her name. "And who is this." The woman was obviously experienced enough not to assume anything. The young man didn't appear to be her husband but you could never tell. 

 "He's the father. Jason." Katrina purred contentedly, as he helped her down onto the cushioned mat where she would attempt some exercises. Jason turned to help the next woman, swaying a large belly through the door. 

 "That's OK! I'll see to her." The nurse exclaimed. She was alarmed at seeing this young man about to man handle another of her new intake. 

 "Its alright, Jason can help me. After all it's his lump too." Margaret grinned. 

 The nurses' eyes swivelled between the two women in astonishment not knowing what to say. Carol entered the sparsely decorated room and lifted her arms for Jason to wrap her in a grip ready to be lowered to the floor. She sat gently on another blue cushioned mat and looked up at him. "Baby says thank you, Daddy." Carol smiled. 

 He turned to June and wrapped his arms around her unable to get a grip then dismissed propriety to hold her large swollen breasts, lowering her too onto a mat. 

 The nurse looked as though her eyes would pop. All four women looked at her expectantly while she pulled herself together. Clearing her throat she said. "There's four more booked in for this session, perhaps we should wait for them." It would at least let her regain some composure. She looked at the young man fussing over the four pregnant women. She thought she had seen it all but this was astonishing, that he should be responsible for all four was just astonishing. 

 Katrina introduced each of the pregnant women as they entered the room and Jason helped them to a mat. "It's OK these belong to Jason too. This is my neighbour Jessie, and Cousin Aggie, and Aunty Mildred. Oh! Mom!" 

 *** 

 Katrina sat up in bed shaking. She looked down at herself half expecting to see a pregnant lump but her tummy was still flat. Her feelings too were flat. The sigh of relief left her lips pouting while she thought about the contentment felt in the dream. On impulse she stuffed a pillow up the baggy tee shirt used as a nightgown and tried to sleep, all the while stroking the stretched shirt. Was it a nightmare or a wish fulfilment dream? Still feeling hungry she got up to feed the microwave with whatever was found open from the fridge. Still half a sleep it took a few moments to realise she still had the pillow tucked up the nightgown. Reluctantly she pulled it free. 

 *** 

 Next day was hectic in the office, preparing for an audit, leaving the four women too busy to discuss what they must do to rid themselves of this perverse situation. When a colleague appeared from another department with a baby shower list it caught Katrina and Carol off guard. Katrina watched Carol's eyes wide with desire, her fingers stroking the tiny romper suit comparing the blue and the pink her eyes filing with a misty far away glow. Katrina wondered if she too shared that wistful look. 

 The colleague patted Carol's stomach and asked her. "Are you going to be next then? I'll start a collection shall I?" She laughed, gathering everything up to stride off on her rounds of the building. 

 Carol gave Katrina a near-tear simper and hurried out to the bathroom. Katrina knew how she felt and decided to carry the pillow again tonight; it might help. 

 All four women peered over the computer monitors across the office at each other. The look in their eyes said it all; each had received a message from him with instructions for tonight. They had been summoned. 

 *** 

 In the car, on their way to June's house Katrina wondered out loud to her two friends. "He must have access to our office systems to send a message like that. One of us must have left their Id and password on the laptop. I wonder what else is on there?" She murmured. 

 "It doesn't matter does it?" Margaret asked. "I mean it's the photos we want back. With them in our hands our lives will be our own again. I'm not saying I haven't enjoyed some of it, but I would rather have the choice of what to do. Whose to say what he will do to us next." She commented, turning from the front seat to look at Carol. 

 Carol grimaced. " I don't want to think about it. Lets just get to June's and try to figure a way out of this. I just hope June has thought of something." 

 Katrina wondered about Margaret. She seemed to find it all just some wild adventure as though re-living her adolescents. Katrina was feeling sick thinking about what she had done and how she would cope when her husband returned home. 

 *** 

 They heard him arrive and quickly put down their drinks listening to the even tap of his leather shoes on the hall tiles. When the door opened they dropped the dressing gowns in unison. "Wonderful. Absolutely ravishing." A small part of each of the women wanted it to be them he was lavishing praise upon yet feeling sullied being naked before this young man. Standing with heads bowed was a sign of their submission though Katrina rationalised they were too embarrassed to look him in the eye. There just hadn't been long enough to mount a revolt or agree to a plan of mutiny. 

 "Katrina, go and wait for me in the hall. Margaret, wait in the kitchen. Carol, go stand in the corner." June couldn't believe they were being treated like this. Four grown women had stripped themselves naked and were being ordered around like servants. She had had just about enough of this ridiculous situation. 

 Before June could protest the audacious young man placed a belt around her waist trapping her arms to her sides. "What are you doing?" She complained. He slipped a blindfold around her eyes. 

 Holding her close he whispered. "You like this don't you." She mouthed a protest in answer at the same time nodding her head betraying more truthful feelings. When she opened her mouth again he popped a gag into her mouth. While she gasped for air trying to get used to this surprise attack s let him lead her across the room with little hesitant steps. Gently pushed over the back of an easy chair she lie there shrinking into a little dark world of her own knowing what was to come. A little whimper escaped her throat as she wondered if perhaps it wasn't the obvious but something horrid, something painful he had planned for her. Was she going to be punished or had she something more frightful to endure. 

 She felt his fingers playing with her pussy and it was a relief. The irony of this made her chuckle. A stranger had her helpless in her own living room and she was grateful that he was playing with her pussy. At least he wasn't greasing her arse. In such a vulnerable state she needed to encourage him and with relief felt her body responding. He was good; he knew a woman's body surprisingly well. She felt him entering her and frowned, it felt wrong. She heard a hiss and the thing inside her expanded filling her up feeling huge, leaving her whimpering. 

 When she felt him lubricating her bottom she struggled only to feel the thing inside her wriggle. Every movement was felt as it touched nerve endings she hadn't known existed. On feeling another device gently eased up her anus she exhaled round the gag, sucking and blowing air in fear. He stroked her hair and spoke reassuringly into her ear until she quietened. Feeling the thing expand like the first one she whinnied like a nervous pony. 

 She was left to her darkness concentrating on the strange feelings, trying carefully not to move, not wanting the sensations to overwhelm her. Her pussy and her bottom were full and the ends were swinging between her legs. She concentrated on keeping still and keeping sane, under control. It wasn't easy when such conflicting feelings were coursing through her body, of sexual tension and fear and above all a need to orgasm. She didn't hear the others being brought back into the room and if she had it would have been some comfort to know they too were blindfolded not seeing her disgraceful condition. 

 Jason positioned the four women in a line close to each other one behind the other. Taking a tube from between June's legs he eased it into Katrina's prepared bottom. It had been well greased yet she still protested by rising up on tiptoe. It was no good the tube reached and the two women were pulled together. Pressing the nozzle of an aerosol can to a valve in the tube it immediately grew and stiffened. One end was firmly buried up Katrina's arse the other deep in June's pussy. Expanded as they were with compressed air there was no way of pulling them free. 

 Carol was next inline then Margaret. Margaret had the tube from her bottom attached to the wall. Each of them was coupled together, from bottom to pussy, like a string of carriages and Jason was about to become their engine. To complete the chain Jason moved into position before Katrina with his own pipe ready to couple. 

 The women were already steamed up moving slightly then stiffening their bodies trying to avoid the slightest movement where each transgression elicited a little whimper of pain and pleasure. The women's perfume was overpowering with sweat and hormones from their excited bodies. Each woman was straining with the dual need to hold on and let go. Holding onto Katrina's hips he slowly eased himself in while she breathed out in a whoosh of air, cooling his chest. 

 He started a gentle rhythm, which Katrina refused to accept until with a grunt she met his hips with hers, all restraint gone she began to buck her hips. The tightly fitted tube up her arse pulled June's pubis forward, and so too Carol and Margaret. For a few strokes they were all out of step with one another feeling the objects movements in vagina and arse to the maximum. A steady writhing rhythm gave them the appearance of some strange caterpillar getting nowhere faster and more urgently. Jason arrived first coming into Katrina who squealed as though applying air breaks urgently. She shuddered to a halt quivering with excitement the tubes movements extending the feelings with every thrust from June. Each of the women in turn came, June shaking her head from side to side, Carol silent and intense, Margaret still bucking furiously back and forward impaling herself on both phalluses, unintentionally punishing Carol's arse. 

 The sound of badly leaking air brakes brought them to a halt. The four women stood perfectly still pressed up close sharing the objects presence, trembling on it, living the last vibrations together. They knew better than to sink to their knees, couldn't anyway, unable to escape the terrible thing inside them. He lifted the blindfold and undid the gag on each woman in turn. Releasing June's arms she swayed threatening to tumble to the floor but Jason held her until she recovered. With June leaning against Carol she looked to be squashed against Margaret with her head between the woman's breasts breathing heavily against June's back. 

 "I need a drink after that. We all need a large glass of water. Off to the kitchen with you." He laughed. "Be careful, move slowly." He said. Each in a world of their own, unable to think for themselves, they obeyed his order shuffling across the room like members of a chain gang. Orgasmic post tremors rippled through their bodies as they made their way to the kitchen. The torture to their bodies was both pleasurable and appallingly embarrassing and it showed on their faces as they shuffled back into the room. 

 "Please, let us go. Undo us. Please!" Katrina pleaded. 

 "I might keep you like that all weekend. It will teach you not to misbehave and to do as you are told." He firmly threatened. 

 "Please sir. We'll do as you say. You don't need to keep us like this. We'll behave. We promise to do what ever you want." Katrina pleaded. She wriggled her bottom in response to a ripple effect starting from Margaret. Jason watched the looks of suppressed pleasure and discomfort cross the four faces. It was amusing to watch so might try this again some time but enough was enough. He didn't just release the tubes he played between their legs until they were lying exhausted upon the carpet. He had been tempted to leave the annul tube in to see the effect of them parading around with tails but let them off this humiliation. 

 "On your knees slaves." He cajoled them. They were compliant like well-trained dogs with Margaret attempting an imitating of an eager pup seeking his approval by sitting up on her knees making little whining noises. Katrina looked at her friend with a look of contempt. Before she could say anything Jason reprimanded her. "There's no need for that. You're all in this together. Take it, you know what to do." He told Katrina. She turned to face the front as though on parade, arching her back and pulling her shoulders back thrusting out her breasts at him at the same time shuffling her knees apart. The others adjusted themselves, squatting on the floor in a row displaying their naked bodies to him. 

 Jason was impressed with the size of June's breasts and they still felt firm. Next to her Carol looked so small and cute it was no wonder they had dressed her up as a schoolgirl on their naughty evenings together. There were quit a few photos on the computer which had given him clues on how best to treat each of them. On the end was Margaret always eager and ready for more. A nice figure but it was her vivacity that beamed out from her entire body straining at him to take notice. He looked back at Katrina. Her thin waist made her breasts look large too but knew by their feel they were smaller than June's.

From their last encounter Katrina knew exactly what to do. She lifted his flagging penis in one hand while cupping his balls with the other. A first tentative kiss to its eye followed by a lick along its length and back, then with a gentle suction it disappeared between her lips into her mouth. All the while she tenderly pumped his balls. She wasn't used to so much physical stimulation, none of them were, but Katrina found it impossible to resist however hard she tried to maintain a detached aloofness. 

 After a short moment he pulled back and moved sideways to stand before June. She repeated the action as mechanically as Katrina had. She had enjoyed him from the very first perhaps because she hadn't had sex for so long. On occasion he caught her staring at his penis with a look of lust in her eyes. She wanted to let go of her inhibitions and pull him on top of her but all the time held back before her friends not wanting to let them down. 

 When Carol took hold of him it was a different feeling altogether. It was as though she revered his penis lavishing it with all her attention, her tongue not resting even when it was in her mouth she worked it hard. Her slim brown fingers were cool on his hot sack continuously moving his balls around without the slightest discomfort to mar the exquisite feelings. 

 Margaret had a similar effect upon him only it was from her own desire to have him erect rather than a concern for his pleasure. She revelled in being a sex thing as long as it led to her own satisfaction, and if he enjoyed it too, it meant more pleasure would be coming her way. 

 With his penis bouncing before him their eyes followed it as though mesmerised by a snake. If he stepped any closer it would tap Katrina on the forehead. Placing bags before them he said. "Here's your clothes for the weekend. Get showered and changed then back down here. Quickly, come on, move." They reached for the bags and struggled to their feet almost as stiff as he was. 

 Katrina realised the significance of what he had just said. They were in for a session lasting the weekend, the whole weekend. After this last humiliation could it get any worse? With a shudder she knew it could and would.

The four friends met early at June's house desperate to discuss their predicament. Giving into a young man's blackmail was leading to ever more degrading sexual acts. With the drinks poured they sat back on the sofa and easy chairs ready for a difficult decision. 

 "We have got to do something about this. I was going to say 'before it goes too far' but it already has. Maybe we could simply refuse to play his games and see what happens." June said. 

 Margaret interrupted. "It was my fault I got you into this so maybe I should confront him." 

 "No! Margaret we're all in this, together. He's blackmailing us all. We must decide together." 

 "He has photos of our naughty evenings here, nothing too bad but very embarrassing. Holding that over us he's pushed us into sleazy games; his games not ours." Taking a deep breath she continued. "I admit enjoying some of it. I never dreamed of doing such things before. I wouldn't think of suggest something so sordid even to a long time partner and here we've being doing, 'things', with a stranger. For me the decision to call his bluff is easier. I don't have a partner to consider whereas you three do. So, Margaret, what do you think?" 

 When young Carol chirped in it was a surprise as she usually just followed the others lead. 

 "If anyone sees the photos of the silly games we played it will be embarrassing but what will happen exactly? My husband doesn't want me. He blames me for not having children. His family are against me. They want him to leave me anyway. In this country I would have the house so I won't be on the streets. At work I'll have you three. We'll have each other as friends to stand up to the ridicule. Lets just tell him to sod off!" 

 They laughed at the fierce delivery and she joined in. They shared another drink still nervous though more confident after their chat. 

 Jason walked in. The conversation abruptly stopped and the three looked to June. 

 "Well June. It looks as though you've been appointed spokesperson." He was prepared for this; even surprised it hadn't happened before now. Slipping a disk into the player he reached for the remote control. "Just a minute June. You need to see this first." 

 The television flickered with images then settled to a shot of the four women on their knees before him. Seeing the look of shock on their faces almost made him laugh out loud but he didn't want to distract them. They were absorbed in the scenes of them playing his games on the wide screen. They each in turn were paying homage to his cock, caressing and kissing it. At least that's how he saw it. What was most disturbing to them was the evident acceptance of their place at his feet. 

 He clapped his hands loudly for their attention. "Now ladies. Take these clothes and get changed. I don't want any more backchat or insubordination. Just do as I say and do it quickly. In case you're wondering, I placed micro cameras around this room. Everything, and I mean everything, is on record. I'll leave that copy for you to enjoy. Now get going, get changed." Jason ordered. 

 In separate rooms they changed into the clothes he provided and nervously applied makeup. The women timidly emerged from bedrooms and bathrooms to meet in the lounge. June and Katrina looked each other up and down and shrugged at the unexpected image, somewhat surprised and mystified but unwilling to contemplate what it was all about. June silently poured drinks wondering why they were dressed up as they were. 

 Katrina and Margaret wore a little black dress hugging their figures over black sheer stockings complete with a pair of shiny black high heels. The hem only just covered stocking tops, stretched tight by a suspender belt. The white of their thighs flashed when they walked. 

 Carol was clad in a black leotard stretched revealingly thin over the bumps of her body. A little bolero jacket revealed, where the leotard thinned, a pair of small breasts every time it swung open. The micro skirt hardly covered her bottom meaning it was more lascivious than protective. Carol thought the little high heel boots cute though. 

 June looked once more into the mirror at her outfit. The long black dress with a deep cut front and back was almost an evening gown, only it revealed as much as it covered. Without panties the slits up to her hips were very daring. 

 None of the women wore panties and Carol relied on the leotard to hold her breasts. Jason had at least allowed the three older women some support, providing a half-cup bra. 

 "Well ladies you do look gorgeous." Jason announced with a wide beam lighting his face. Despite themselves they couldn't help preening in his presence, brushing back hair or adjusting stocking seams. He took each one by the hand turning them with a look of admiration. "Such a beautiful long neck." He said, while kissing June below an ear, then blowing gently into it with a promise of more to come. 

 The clothes would have been sluttish if they hadn't been so obviously expensive. Was he intending to take them out on the town looking like high- class hookers? Someone was sure to recognise them in the neighbourhood. What would friends and neighbours think? What would the gossip be after the exaggerations of wagging tongues? 

 Their protests were silenced by his reassurances. "You're looking too wonderful to waste on this neighbourhood. I don't think there is anywhere around here that deserves you. So I have a special surprise. Tonight will be my treat to you for being good girls and obeying my instructions. No questions. Just follow me." He ordered them out of the room. They wiggled their hips on high heels out to a waiting limousine thankful for the cloak of darkness, then again relieved the windows were heavily tinted. 

 June found it too easy joining the others in obeying his wishes. She understood how he had captured the friends into this compliant role but was still mystified as to how easily she too had given in to him. They spread themselves out in the back of the limo, sinking into the leather, as it silently moved off. 

 When Margaret let him kiss her deeply June was shocked to see her responding so wantonly to his wandering hands. The hussy was spreading her legs without a trace of reserve. When he turned to Carol, June had to look out of the window, ignoring the girls imploring eyes. June couldn't help the young friend knowing she had lost the will to resist him. Although angry June knew that when it came to her turn she would give in. She gulped at the champagne and poured another. 

 With a guilty look at Carol she saw the young woman had closed her eyes no longer afraid yet still reluctant to give in completely. A furtive glance at Katrina sitting across from her revealed a pose of defiance, the only one of them prepared to resist him. 

 Carol clamped her thighs together not wanting the shame of showing herself up before her friends. There was nothing she could do about his teasing hand pulling at a nipple while his caresses worked on her neck and lips. Unused to such attention it aroused her more quickly than her defences could be raised. It was a shock when his fingers slid up the fine material covering her thighs. Too late she clamped her legs shut on his hand. Those devilish fingertips flicked against the thin material covering her bud sending shock waves through her legs. They tensed and relaxed in spasms as though operated by him through her sensitive little button. The press-stud parted and he was into her creating more unmanageable patterns of sensations; her legs parted, thrust outward, quivering to the rhythm of his fingers. 

 Margaret stared at the two of them clearly wishing she was the centre of his attention. Katrina looked out into the night trying to distance her self from them. June downed another glass of champagne embarrassed at being a forced witness to her friend's seduction and feeling guilty for not helping the young woman. 

 The limo cruised to a halt without a discernable movement. By the time the chauffeur had opened the door June was sitting adjusting what little skirt there was, perceptibly clenching her thighs. "Come on girls a night out will do you good. I don't suppose you will relax but a little adventure is good for the spirit." Jason laughed as he guided them out into the dark night. Lights flashed in multi coloured neon brightness revealing this to be an entertainment district for tourists and hustlers. 

 Carol kept close to her companions walking straight legged afraid of revealing an open crotch now cooling in the night air. She helped her friends tottering in high heels all struggling desperately to keep up with Jason not wanting to be left out on the streets dressed as hookers. 

 Into a club they tottered, past a door leading onto to the dance floor, continuing along a corridor into a more secluded room. A bar top was set into a wall, obviously adjoining the dance floor from the sound of music seeping in. At this end of the room stood a sturdy looking pool table. Peering past it they saw a serious game of cards being played, obviously serious from the players expressions and piles of chips stacked high. The card players were the only other customers and ignored them, concentrating on the game instead. 

 Carol looked around desperate for a ladies room needing to pop her modesty securely back into place. The body stocking had been rude enough pulling tight between her legs, though now her lips were pouting crudely from their lair. She tried to lean forward in an attempt to lower the hem of the skirt knowing if she stood up straight and raised her arms all would be revealed. 

 Not wanting to sit they shuffled to the bar as though tethered to him, needing to be close under his protection. Still no one took any notice of them concentrating instead on the game. Perhaps their outfits weren't so outrageous here. With drinks in hand Jason announced. "Ladies we are going to have a game of pool." 

 They looked relieved for a moment. Katrina choked on a Gin and Tonic, while Margaret looked across the table knowing that meant bending over it. Carol blanched pale on following Margaret's eyes. Reaching and bending over the green baize would mean revealing all. 

 "As an added incentive the loser has to pay a penalty. The loser will be given a token. That token will be placed in the pot on the poker table. Whoever wins the pot takes the loser. They will own the loser for the weekend." Jason smiled. 

 The four women were aghast at the idea that some stranger might win them in a bet. If they hadn't been so sexually excited with their wits dulled by alcohol they may have railed against the idea. Instead they stared at each other wondering at each other's ability. Who was the best player or more importantly who was the worst player? 

 "Heads or tails?" The women looked at Jason wondering if this was another torture then realised it was to see who played first. 

 "We can't do it Jason. You can't do this to us it's too squalid to contemplate. Please Jason." Katrina begged quietly holding her friends close for support, knowing if she upset him he might do something even crazier. Dressed the way they were and without money it was going to be difficult getting home without him. The feeling of vulnerability kept them dependent on him but it was the video of those dreadful games that brought them to heel so effectively. 

 "Play the game and I'll think of something else. Something private, between us." He smiled with a frown revealing they needed to show willing or else. It was enough. They started playing. 

 Bending over the table for a shot Margaret knew what she was showing and tried desperately to keep her legs together. The card players were quiet, the pot was too valuable not to concentrate on the game. They were men and couldn't help glancing every time a woman bent to a shot. 

 Carol had run off to the rest room to press the popper back at her crotch only it had a terrible habit of popping when stretched, always at the wrong moment. June avoided the card player's side of the pool table, taking the chance of doubling the ball across the table, even if it meant losing. Even Katrina was subdued revealing how humiliated and frightened she had become. 

 Jason looked on ensuring they put on a show, muttering his disapproval if one of them tried to avoid a shot on the card players side of the table. The four women had become cowed enough to follow through with his suggestions even if it meant stretching out over the table. Eventually the game was over, all four had played and the loser was Carol. The four women watched Jason expectantly hoping they had earned the alternative task; hoping it was less terrifying than being given away to a stranger. 

 "Ladies, finish your drinks and follow me. I have a surprise for you." Jason told them. On seeing his friend's pile of chips had grown considerably there was no need to hang around. The guy had his back to the pool table which Jason was sure had saved his concentration as planned. Despite their preparations even he wouldn't have been immune to distraction from such a show. 

 Tottering on high heels they clipped along behind Jason whispering their fears. Two doors down he stopped and knocked at a storefront, closed and shuttered for the night. Four scantily clad women trying to be unobtrusive on a brightly light and crowded street was impossible. Whatever was in store for them behind that door would be a relief from the catcalls and lewd offers from passers by leaving them eager to follow him. 

 The door opened enough for them to squeeze through one at a time. The lights were off leaving the place in darkness except for the neon of advertising signs slanted through the iron shutters. They had walked into some kind of workshop at peace for the night. 

 "Wait here. Katrina, you come with me." Jason demanded. She followed him through a bead curtain leaving the others huddling together for comfort. Along a narrow corridor with squeaking floorboards only heard in the dead of night, away from the noise of the street and late night revellers. In the gloom she saw a row of barbers chairs covered by dustsheets. 

 "Sit there." He ordered, after clearing one of the chairs. She looked around for the man that had let them in but it seemed he had disappeared only hanging around to open the door. In the large shabby chair she hefted herself up feeling the leather upon her bare arse. Behind her Jason popped a gag into her mouth, reached over her and clamped both wrists to the arms of the chair. "Quiet!" he hissed. Scared and angry she sat still and silent. Before he left he whisked a dustsheet back over the chair and Katrina. 

 "Your next June." He said and waited until she had passed through the curtain. Sitting her in a chair furthest from Katrina he did the same to her. She sat there glowering at him until he covered her like a parrot in a cage. 

 Carol didn't want to be left on her own in the creepy shop so walked forward as soon as Jason appeared at the curtain. He shrugged and guided her to a seat between June and Katrina. She had her mouth clamped shut to stop her teeth from chattering with fear. He kissed her lips and told her. "Open wide." So used to doing as she was told he slipped the gag into her mouth without a hassle. She sat supine while both wrists were clamped to the chair arms. 

 Margaret sat guessing her three friends were either side of her. What was she to do but follow their lead? Pulling the sheets off the chairs he now had the four victims seated before him. Feeling no better with her friends beside her Katrina watched in trepidation as Jason fiddled with the chair at her feet. She felt him pull the stilettos from her feet but when she tried to stretch found her ankles had been tethered. 

 Now the four women were firmly attached to the chairs he went back to Katrina. A lever behind the chair winched the back down at the same time raising leg rests. Katrina's legs were lifted up and outward. Each in turn Jason adjusted them until all four ladies were lying back with legs spread, helplessly tied to the chairs. 

 They looked to left and right squirming and signalling messages to each other with wild eyes flashing. It was no good they were trapped. With the hem of the dresses and skirts tucked around the waist everything was on show leaving it obvious what the centre of attention was to be. They hoped this alternative plan wasn't worse than the original. Perhaps one of them should have been sacrificed for the others safety. What they hadn't guessed was this had been planned from the start and the pool room merely a diversion in payment for the use of a friends workshop. 

 "Just relax ladies. You must be used to showing me everything by now." Jason reassured them with a laugh, and then settled on a stool between June's legs. He began to trim and shave her. With a brush he tickled her most sensitive places applying lather over lips and her entire crotch. "Now keep still." He warned. After a rinse he leaned forward and kissed her naked smooth lips. Sucking everything into his mouth he nibbled upon her inner lips and licked as deeply as he could. 

 He moved the stool over to Carol. She mewed through the gag pleading for him to stop. What was she going to tell her husband! The others couldn't fully see what was going on but guessed. Katrina and Margaret had already been shaved bare and were used to it but were wondering if this was all they were to be subject to. When he bent forward to kiss his handy work Carol became silent then. Again she started up a keening noise only with an obviously different meaning entirely. Eventually he stopped and so did Carol as she came. 

 He moved over to Margaret. She felt his fingers working their magic over her now engorged lips. The sounds from her two friends and anticipation of what was to come had set her off on the road to craven desire. 

 Taking the cloth off a tray Jason looked at a set of instruments prepared for him by a friend. The same friend playing cards who was now a winner for a change. That is, if he had walked away when the women left the pool hall. Jason wondered if he could do this. After practicing with a banana he had become proficient but this was very different. 

 Being so wet it was easy to ease a Chinese egg into Margaret's vagina. She was usually up for anything but this was obviously a surprise. He sprayed her lips with a mild anesthesthetic followed with an injection. Neither of which brought a reaction so he quickly worked away while she was still getting used to the trembling egg. 

 Katrina strained to move her head forward to see what was going on between her legs but the gag was attached to the headrest preventing movement. She stopped squirming on feeling the egg invade her. 

 Carol hardly moved seeming to have given up. She lay back with legs splayed letting him get on with the task. 

 June hissed at him through the gag obviously angry and wanting out. He wondered at this having already worked out she liked to be tied up. He didn't stop to think she might be worried about her friends. She soon stopped fidgeting on feeling the egg slide deep into her vagina. 

 Jason finished the task on the four women and lowered their feet knowing they were feeling the strain of the ordeal. He fitted a belt round each of their waists and unclipped each wrist from the chair arm to clip it to the belt. Now free of the chairs he helped each of them up and ushered them out through the bead curtain. They had no time to think or find out what he had been up to. What was the purpose of all that other than shaving them? With each step they felt the Chinese egg quivering inside. 

 Walking back out onto the street they were more anxious than ever; with wrists now attached to their waists they were so very vulnerable to passing strangers. They looked at each other seeing the fear in the eyes but they couldn't talk to reassure each other. Still wearing the gags they were attracting attention so were glad to hobble into the waiting limo.

It sped off from a gathering crowd before the celebrating crowd could gain confidence enough to close in. Ten minutes wasn't enough to get their breath back but they had to alight, ushered out by Jason. Fortunately there were no stairs to negotiate in the high heels. Straight along a ground floor corridor into a large lounge. 

 The house was as large as June's with a more modern décor. Posters of bands and one of Che Guevara lined the walls down the corridor. The lounge had four large sofas around a Persian rug with sets of four watercolours on each wall, by modern artists. The house wasn't exactly minimalist, it was comfortable. 

 "There's a bathroom through there, large enough for the four of you. I'm sure you'll want to freshen up." Jason knew it would be terribly frustrating for them not being able to talk to each other though it would be plain what had happened as soon as they got in there. He listened to the anguished muffled cries. It was hard not to laugh. 

 The anaesthetic must be wearing off now so the cries would become more urgent. He had sewn loops of a cotton thin wire into their pussy lips then slipped a tiny padlock through them. Their pussies were effectively locked up. Not so much theirs as his now, for he had the keys. 

 Before that he had slipped in a Chinese egg, which would be impossible to extract now their vaginas' were locked up. It was no wonder they looked cross- eyed walking out of that store into the limo. Any movement would cause the ball to vibrate inside them and now they knew it would be impossible to extract the devilish device. 

 Each of the women had a small bell clipped to the padlock that clasped their pussy shut. Each time they moved in tinkled. When they became excited the tiny bells would ring like a kittens convention. 'An appropriate gift for his pussies.' He thought. 

 On bare feet the four women trailed, stepping delicately, into the lounge. "I guess you tried to cut the wire? Its a titanium alloy and cant be cut, at least not by anything you would trust that close to your sensitive parts." 

 They were looking at him with imploring eyes wanting to be set free. Each of them wondered what torment he was going to deal out next. Had it been Margaret who said it couldn't get any worse? Well it had. Report_Story
