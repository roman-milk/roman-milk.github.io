One Man's Fantasy

On the way to my condo Kristal said, "I don't know how you did it, but you really put Jerry's panties in a twist. He's all upset over you not going along with the program." 

"I owe it all to you. Your phone call is what got me going." 

I explained to her my getting with John and the outcome of our talk. 

"What I don't understand is what caused you to get on the phone and clue me in?" 

"Simple sweetie. You seemed like a nice guy and Jerry was getting ready to do to you what Hollywood always does to nice guys. Screw them. They have stuck it to me a time or two and I saw it as my chance to get a little payback. That and you are kind of cute." 

"Me? Cute?" 

"Don't sell yourself short sweetie. If it was just the money I would have taken a pass on this deal. You might not think so, but you do have something going for you. So, tell me what we will be doing this week." 

I laid it all out for her and she told me that what she had packed would work for most of it, but if I was doing a tux and a limo for the symphony she was going to have to come up with an evening gown. 

"I guess that will be the first order of business in the morning." 

When we got to my condo I carried her bags in and showed her to her room. I showed her where everything was and while she was in the bathroom freshening up from her trip I got the pitcher of martinis out of the fridge and poured two glasses. I had checked with Jerry and found out some of her likes and dislikes and her favorite drink was a martini with the little onion. I had it ready for her when she came into the room. She took it, sat down on the couch next to me, tucked her legs up under her and asked: 

"What's the plan for tomorrow?" 

"Get up when we get up. I'll fix breakfast and then we will go shopping for your evening gown. Have lunch and then I'll expose you to some of my friends and hope that you won't come away thinking too badly about me." 

"That should be interesting. Just what are they going to do that might cause me to think poorly of you?" 

"Just be themselves. They can be a pretty crude bunch when they have had a beer or three." 

"So if you are afraid of what they might do why are you going to take me to meet them?" 

"It is one of those rock and hard place things. Before I had a clue that my fantasy would come true or that it would happen this week I organized a 'guy's afternoon out'. I arranged a skybox for tomorrow's Rockies game. It is my outing so I have to go, but now that you are here there isn't anyway I'm not going to make the most of every minute I can spend with you." 

"Well sweetie, for your information I can do crude so don't worry about me." 

She finished her martini and said, "I'm beat sweetie. It has been a long day for me and I'm going to turn in." 

She stood up, leaned down and kissed me on the cheek and then went to her room. I went to bed thinking that I might never wash that cheek ever again. 

x-x-x-x-x 

The morning was a revelation. I had never seen Kristal without her make up and her hair done just right. All of her photos were glamour shots and in all of her films she was made up to look her best. The night we had dinner and when I met her at the airport she was perfection personified. 

When she wandered into the kitchen in an oversized Michigan State sweat shirt, flip flops, no make up and 'bed' hair she looked totally different. Put a picture of her the way she looked that morning next to one of her glamour shots and you would never know that they were the same person. Even though just out of bed and not at her best she was still breathtaking beautiful. I fed her scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, fried potatoes and sourdough toast and after three cups of coffee she got up to shower and dress. 

She poured through the sports pages of the Rocky Mountain News while I drove us to Park Meadows Mall and then we spent the better part of the morning and early afternoon hitting shops. She eventually found the dress she wanted and on our way out to the car we passed a sports shop and told me to wait and she would be right back. She went into the store and came out ten minutes later with a package. I gave her a questioning look and she smiled at me and said "Later." 

We hit a Red Robin for lunch and talked some more about what we would be doing that week. She was especially nervous about having dinner at my brother's on Wednesday because my parents and older sister would be there. 

"What is your family going to think about you being with me?" 

"Don't forget that it was John's plan that took care of Jerry. He knows about you and he thinks it is fantastic. As for mom, dad and my sister what are the odds that they watch porn films? Even if they do would I have proposed doing what we are doing if I cared about what other people would think? Besides, my parents are too well mannered to make you feel uncomfortable even if they do know who you are." 

"What about your sister?" 

"She has always considered her little brother a dork. If she knows who you are and sees us together it will knock her back on her heels." 

"I'm not worried about me sweetie. I've had a long time to get used to how some people look at me. I know you don't care about your buddies, but family is different." 

"Thank you for worrying about it, but I know my family and I'm not concerned." 

We went home, changed clothes and headed for Coors Field. Kristal was wearing jeans, tennis shoes and a windbreaker even though it was fairly warm outside and I asked her why she had it on. She smiled at me and told me that she had heard that Denver turned chilly in the evenings at times and she wanted to be prepared. 

When we walked into the box the guys who were already there turned to the door and you could see the jaws drop when I walked in with Kristal. "Guys, this is Kristal" and then I introduced her to the guys and said: 

"I know this is supposed to be a guys outing, but Kristal flew in from Los Angeles to spend a few days with me and I couldn't just leave her alone at the condo." 

I could tell from the looks on the faces of Charlie and Troy that they knew who Kristal was and I wondered how the afternoon was going to play out. It didn't take long for things to get interesting. The Rockies were playing the Giants that day and as the Giants took the field Kristal put her fingers in her mouth and gave a loud whistle. The she hollered "Kick ass guys; kick some Rocky Mountain ass" as she shed her windbreaker and displayed the Giant's jersey that she had apparently bought at Park Meadows. She looked around the room, gave a 1000 watt smile and said: 

"What can I say guys. I'm a California girl." 

The tight jeans and jersey did nothing to hide or disguise her 34D-23-34 body from the guys and I'm sure that baseball was the farthest thing from their minds at that moment. I saw Charlie and Troy looking at me with dumbfounded looks on their faces as I moved up to Kristal and put my arms around her and hugged her. 

"You should have warned me about this." 

"What?" she laughed, "And spoil the surprise?" 

She pulled my head down and kissed me on the lips, winked at me and then we settled in to watch the game. 

They was a lot of good natured ribbing between Kristal and the guys and Kristal gave better that what she got. All in all it was a fun afternoon made better by the Rockies winning. The guys ragged on Kristal about the Left Coast Losers and then Kristal surprised the hell out of everyone there, including me, when she went up to Jonas who was the only one there wearing a Rockies jersey and took her Giants jersey off. She handed it to Jonas and as everyone stared at her tits barely contained by her bra she said: 

"Here. Trade you." 

Jonas stared at her cleavage for several seconds before grabbing her jersey and taking his off and handing it to her. He held it to his nose, sniffed it and said: 

"I'll never wash it and I'll sleep with it under my pillow for the rest of my life." 

Kristal kissed him on the cheek and then she slipped on the Rockies jersey. Jonas was 6 foot four and his jersey fell below her knees and she laughed and said: 

"I have a new nightgown." 

She picked up her windbreaker and said "Thanks guys; I had a good time." Then she turned to me and said, "Take me home Rob; I'm horny." 

We walked out leaving nine guys looking at each other and shaking their heads in disbelief. As we walked to the car Kristal said: 

"How did I do sweetie?" 

"You were magnificent." 

"Yeah, I was, wasn't I." 

x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

We had dinner at a Denny's and then we went back to my condo. I pored her a martini and we curled up on the couch and watched TV until she yawned and said she was going to turn in. I watched the idiot box for another half hour and then I went to bed. I spent some time staring up at the ceiling reliving the day and wondering how it might change my life. I knew one thing for sure. There were nine guys who were never going to look at me the same way again. 

The next morning I woke to the sounds of noise coming from the kitchen. I got up to find Kristal rummaging in the cupboards. All she had on was the Rockies jersey and she still looked fantastic, sleepy hair and all. She heard me come into the room and without turning she asked: 

"Where do you keep the Bisquick? I'm going to make pancakes." 

I showed her where it was and then I went and took my morning shower. Kristal stuck her head in the room as I was toweling myself dry and asked me how many hotcakes I would like and I saw her looking at my exposed penis as I told her three or four and since I had never seen her in any of her videos with anything less than huge I wondered if she was thinking: 

"Poor guy. Only six inches. No wonder his wife wanted to try a bigger one." 

Thankfully I had long ago realized that there was nothing you could do about what you were born with and having a big dick just meant that you were born lucky, I thought of the joke about the hooker who laughed at the small cock on her customer and asked him who he expected to satisfy "with that tiny thing." The customer looked her right in the eye and said "Me." That was my attitude. I would always do my best to get my partner off and if that meant burying my head up to the neck in her pussy and licking it from the inside I'd go for it, but when it came to getting me off what I had did the job just fine. Besides, if Kristal felt sorry for me for only having six and five eights inches it didn't matter since I'd already made it clear that sex was not part of the deal. 

Then I looked in the mirror and thought "Get a grip Rob. For all you know she might have walked away pissed because you didn't get an instant hard on as soon as you saw her walk in." I finished in the bathroom and walked into the kitchen and she set a plate with four hotcakes down in front of me and then sat down across from me. As she nibbled on her lone pancake she asked: 

"What's on for today?" 

"The limo will pick us up at six-fifteen. Until then the day is yours. What would you like to do?" 

"My cousin used to drive in the race to the top of Pike's Peak, but I have never been there. Is it close enough that we could go there and be back in time?" 

"We can be there in an hour and a half. If we leave in the next half hour we can make it." 

It was a very enjoyable day. I'm lucky that I didn't kill us on the drive because I kept taking my eyes off the road and looking over at Kristal sitting next to me. I know it was silly of me. I mean she was there and I knew she was there, but I had to keep looking to confirm that it wasn't a daydream -- a figment of my imagination. 

We spent an hour on the top of the Peak and she bought a couple of souvenir t- shirts at the gift shop. While we were there I led her over to one of the telescopes that were mounted on pedestals and pointed it southwest. 

"If you look real hard you can see the roof of the little cabin I have over by Evergreen Station." 

"A cabin? Can we go there?" 

"Not this time, not and get back in time for the symphony, but I'll take you there on one of the next weeks you are here. I'll warn you ahead of time that you will be roughing it. There is no electricity, no running water and an outhouse for a bathroom." 

"I can rough it. I want to go. Can't we go now? Do we really have to go to the symphony?" 

"No honey, we don't have to go to the symphony, but I didn't pack for the cabin. I don't have any of the things we will need if we are going there. I promise you that we will go there the next time you are here." 

"I'm going to hold you to that. I like the mountains." 

x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

The limo driver knocked on the door at exactly six-fifteen and I called out to Kristal that it was time to go. My jaw dropped when she came out of her room. She was stunning. It was a good thing that the symphony was a listening event because if it was a visual event no one would see any of it. All eyes and I do mean all eyes -- male and female -- were going to be on my date. 

It started as soon as we stepped out the door. The driver of the limo could not take his eyes off of Kristal. He stumbled a couple of times on his way to open the rear door for us because he wasn't watching where he was walking and instead kept glancing at Kristal. I wasn't sure that I wanted him to drive because I knew he would have his eyes on the rear view mirror instead of the road. By the time we reached the car I knew for sure that I didn't want him to drive and I got a big grin on my face. 

It was silly of me, but the whole thing was silly. My idea and Kristal's acceptance of it were off the wall to begin with so why not a little more weirdness. When we reached the limo he opened the door for Kristal and then I told him to get in back with her. He protested until I slipped him a fifty and then he got in back and took the seat opposite Kristal while she looked at me with a bemused smile. I got in, started the limo and drove away. 

When we got to the auditorium the people on the sidewalk saw a man in a tux get out of the limo, walk to the rear door and open it. A stunningly beautiful woman got out followed by a man in a chauffer's uniform. The man in the tux offered the beautiful lady his arm and then they walked into the building. At least sixty people saw it happen and I'm sure that most of them are still trying to get their minds around it. As we took our seats Kristal asked me: 

"Why in the world did you do that?" 

"He couldn't take his eyes off you. He would have been looking in the rear view all the way here and God only knows who he might have hit. Besides, just imagine how it will play in the movie after Jerry and his producer buddy read about it in your diary." 

The evenings performance was a dual program of Beethoven's First and Fifth symphonies. I was totally knocked on my ass when just before the start of the Fifth Kristal leaned to me and said: 

"You should pay particular attention when the opening measure introduces the piccolo, contrabassoon and three trombones at the same time. That is quite a departure from Beethoven's usual style." 

I don't know jack about classical music other than know I like to listen to it so I sat there and looked at her open mouthed. She smiled at me and said: 

"What? You think all I am is a hot body and a pretty face?" 

There was a cocktail party at the Brown Palace after the performance and Kristal shone. The men and women in attendance could not take their eyes off of her. The men looked at her with lust in their hearts and the women looked at her with hatred in their eyes and all of them, men and women alike, wondered what a woman like that was doing on the arm of a guy like me. 

I was waiting at the bar waiting on the bartender to build us two fresh drinks while I watched Kristal in conversation with Riccardo Muti who was the visiting conductor who had conducted the evening's performance when Bill Thomas walked up to me. 

"I never knew that you had that large of a dick." 

"Why would you say that?" 

"Why else would Kristal Summers be with you?" 

"She likes my smile." 

"Yeah, right. You have to let me in on your secret." 

Before I could say anything Kristal walked up to us and I handed her her fresh martini. I introduced her to Bill and then Bill said: 

"I just have to ask this. What is a drop dead gorgeous woman doing with a guy like Rob? I mean he is a really great guy and all, but....." and before he could finish what he was going to say Kristal interrupted him and said: 

"He is great in bed." 

Bill's jaw dropped and Kristal took me by the arm and said, "Come on lover, there is someone I want you to meet" and she led me over to Muti. As we walked away from Bill she said: 

"I think your stock just went up a few points. Hope you don't mind." 

"Not in the least. Just having him hear you call me lover made my evening perfect." 

After we settled into the limo I said, "There is something I have always wanted to do. Will you give me your panties?" 

"Are you that kinky? You want to sniff my panties?" 

"No, nothing like that." 

She lifted her dress and took off her panties and I saw her pussy live for the first time. Before then I had only seen it on my downloaded videos. I had to tear my eyes away from it when she handed me her panties. I rapped on the partition and when the driver lowered it I handed him the undergarment and told him to put them over the rear view mirror. He did what I told him to do and as the partition slid back up Kristal asked: 

"What did you do that for?" 

"For the same reason I drove earlier. I want to arrive alive at our destination and he just can't take his eyes off of you. For that matter I can't either, but I need for his eyes to be on the road." 

"You know what he will think is going on back here don't you?" 

"It will give him something to tell his buddies." 

When we got back to the condo I tipped the driver handsomely and then we went inside and changed out of our evening clothes. I put on sweats and Kristal joined me on the couch wearing her Rockies jersey. We sipped martinis and she filled me in on Hollywood gossip and I filled her in on my career as a civil engineer. She wanted to talk about Joan, but I shut that down in a hurry. 

"It is still a very raw open wound and I don't need to go there." 

She told me that she knew how it felt because she had gone through something similar. 

"I didn't get to see it like you did, but someone who did see it told me and when I confronted him he didn't even try to deny it. He just shrugged his shoulders and acted like it was no big thing." 

That made no sense to me. Why would anyone who had a woman like Kristal be playing around with someone else? We talked a little more and then called it a night. 

x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

Wednesday I took Kristal out for breakfast and then we spent a good part of the day lying around the condo complex's swimming pool. Spending a good part of the day looking at Kristal in a bikini was almost enough in itself to make the week worthwhile. Because of the major, major wood that it caused I spent a good part of that time lying on my stomach and don't think for one second that Kristal didn't know why. 

We arrived at John's house at five and found that my sister and her husband were already there. John swore to me that he didn't tell his wife Nancy anything at all about Kristal other than I would be bringing a date to the family dinner and when Nancy and Kristal were introduced I saw no sign that Nancy has a clue as to Kristal was. It was a different story with my sister Rachel and her husband. There was no doubt from the look on Kevin's face that he knew who Kristal was. I couldn't read the look on Rachel's face. It could have been that she knew who Kristal was or it just could have been shock and surprise that her dork of a brother could even know a woman like Kristal. I know Kristal read the faces the same as I did, but I had no way of knowing what she was thinking.  

===

We sipped martinis and talked for a while and then Nancy got up to see about dinner and Kristal got up and said she would give Nancy a hand. Rachel looked from me to Kristal and then back to me again and then she got up to join Nancy and Kristal in the kitchen. Kevin was just bursting to say something, but he couldn't because John was there and he didn't know that John already knew about Kristal. John could read people and he knew what was roaring around in Kevin's head, but he wasn't going to say anything. He just smiled and said: 

"When you told me about her and described her I thought you were probably on drugs, but now that I've seen her I can honestly say that your description did not do her justice. Where in the world did you meet her?" 

I gave him the cover story that Kristal and I had agreed on. "I was in Los Angeles on business a month or so ago and I met her while I was out there." 

Before I could say anymore mom and dad came into the room. Mom looked around and then said: 

"Okay, where is she? Where is this girl who is so special that we are having a family dinner in the middle of the week just so we can meet her?" 

John laughed and said, "Get real mom. We set this dinner up before we even knew about Rob's new lady friend. Anyway, the girls are in the kitchen." 

Mom headed off for the kitchen and dad sat down and as was usual with him the talk immediately turned to sports and stayed on that subject until mom came back into the room with Kristal and introduced her to dad. I saw his eyebrows rise as he looked at her and then at me. I read the look. 

"You're shitting me! You and my boy? No way! Just what the hell is going on here?" 

But dad was too well mannered to say what he was thinking and so he just shook Kristal's hand and said "Nice meeting you." 

At that point Nancy called us all to dinner. Naturally, mom being mom, the table conversation started off with mom asking: 

"And just how did you two meet?" 

We knew it was coming and we were ready for it. Kristal said "I was walking down the street in Beverly Hills when one of my heels got caught in a crack in the sidewalk. I stumbled, twisted my ankle, started to fall and luckily Rob was there to catch me. He helped me to a seat at a table at one of the outdoor cafes and one thing led to another and we had dinner that night. When I knew I was coming to Denver I gave Rob a call and he offered to show me around while I'm here." 

"What have you seen" Nancy asked and as soon as Kristal said that I had taken her to a Rockies game my dad jumped in and it was sports talk again and Kristal wound dad up when she told him that the Rockies were a second rate team compared to the Giants and the conversation that followed was lively indeed until dinner was over and it was time to clear the table. Kristal got up to help Nancy as did mom and Rachel and the men moved to the living room. 

The funniest part of the evening for me was watching Kevin. He was just dying to say something to me, but didn't dare in front of John or my dad. The women finished in the kitchen and joined us in the living room. After everyone was seated Nancy said: 

"The reason for this little gathering tonight is that John and I have an announcement to make and we wanted everyone to hear it at the same time. There is going to be a new member in the family." 

Everyone turned to look at Kristal and me and my mom gasped. Nancy laughed and said, "I'm not talking about Rob and Kristal. I'm talking about what will be joining us in a little over eight months." 

There were congratulations and the talk was off sports for the rest of the evening. After a bit I said that Kristal and I had to be going and as everyone was saying goodbye to Kristal my dad looked me in the eye and said: 

"I sure as hell hope you know what you are doing." 

Mom and Kristal walked up to us before I could ask him what he meant. Was it his way of telling me that he knew who Kristal was or was it a "She's out of your league son; make sure you don't get burnt" kind of thing? As we got in the car Kristal said: 

"I think that went well. You have a very nice family." 

"They seemed to like you." 

"Your mother and Nancy invited me to go shopping with them tomorrow." 

"What did you tell them?" 

"I said that I wasn't sure what your plans were and that I would call them and let them know." 

"I had planned on going back up into the mountains and spending the night at the cabin, but I would never come between a woman and her chance to go shopping." 

"And this woman would never choose shopping over going to the mountains so I guess that settles that." 

When we got home there was a message from Kevin on the answering machine. 

"Call me Rob. It is important." 

I called him and put the phone on speaker. 

"Hello? 

"Its Rob Kevin, I got your message. Whatcha need?" 

"Jesus Rob, do you have any idea who you brought to dinner tonight?" 

"Of course I do." 

"You mean you know that she is a porn star?" 

"Who? Kristal? Where did you get an off the wall idea like that?" 

"Not shitting you Rob. Her name is Kristal Summers and she is in porn videos." 

"Now I know you don't know what you are talking about. Her name is Kristal Grabowski, not Summers." 

"Trust me on this one Rob. I've got two of her videos. No mistake Rob; she is Kristal Summers." 

"Oh wow. How lucky can you get." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Have you got a porn star sleeping at your house?" 

"No." 

"I guess I have and how lucky is that. Talk to you later Kevin. Bye." 

I smiled at Kristal and said, "Wait until I tell him we are getting married." I saw her face change and quickly said, "I'll just be pulling his leg honey; just jerking his chain." 

"How long before all of your family knows?" 

I told her what my father said as we were leaving and then told her that by then all of the men probably knew. 

"And you don't care?" 

"Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately? What man wouldn't give an arm or a leg to have you on his arm? All it means is that some people will be looking at me now and wondering just what it is that I have that makes me desirable to a porn star. Tell you what. From now on I want you to answer the phone when it rings. When they ask for me say something like "Let me see if he has his clothes back on yet." It will drive them all crazy trying to figure it out." 

"You really don't care." 

"Not a bit." 

"What should I tell them if they ask me point blank?" 

"You tell them anything that your little heart desires." 

"You are sure about this?" 

"Absolutely. But for right now you need to pack for a day and a night in the mountains. Sweatshirt, jeans, tennis shoes, sweater and your windbreaker. It can get pretty chilly up there this time of the year." 

x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

The aspen leaves were changing color so the drive to the cabin was colorful. On the dirt road on the way up the mountain we saw several deer and a couple of elk. Kristal spotted a hawk and just after she saw it it dived and that signaled that some poor rabbit or other small creature had become dinner. 

Kristal was surprised when we pulled up at the cabin and she looked around. She must have been thinking of something like the lodges at Lake Tahoe so a small stone cabin with a small wooden deck caught her by surprise. 

"I'll admit that it isn't much to look at, but as a weekend get-a-way it works just fine." 

I unlocked the door and she went in while I unloaded the water, ice, food and propane tank for the Coleman stove. While I was doing that Kristal was looking around and shaking her head as I said: 

"No electricity, no running water and the heat comes from that wood burning pot-bellied stove over there in the corner." 

She pointed to the stairs at the end of the room and I told her that they went up to what served as the bedroom in the loft. She went up the stairs, looked around and came down. 

"There is only one bed up there." 

"I know. That is where you will sleep. I'll take the couch down here." 

We went out onto the deck and sat down and I pointed out the landmarks. "That cone shaped breast looking mountain straight out in front is Mount Pisgah. Just to the left of it is Cripple Creek. You can't see it from here, but at night you will see the town's lights reflected in the sky. That large lump to the far left is Pike's Peak." 

"What do you do when you come up here?" 

"Take walks, sit on the deck and read or just sit and look at the scenery." 

"That's it?" 

"If you like peace and quiet it is enough. Come on, I'll show you around." 

We went for a long two hour walk and when we got back I fixed us some lunch and we took it out on the deck to eat it. She spotted another hawk, but this one just circled looking for prey and not finding any it moved off to the south. We sat there and talked for about a half hour and suddenly I became aware that we were holding hands. I've no idea of when or how it happened, but I was not about to do anything that would break the spell. Maybe another hour went by and I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. 

"Sit still and don't move" I told Kristal, "And watch the tree line just to your right." 

A doe stepped cautiously out from the trees and moved out into the open and seconds later three more followed her and the four of them slowly meandered across the back of the property. 

"I've got a couple of salt blocks down in that little dip about a fifty yards down from the deck and just to the left of those dead aspens." 

The lead doe came up to where the salt blocks were, glanced in the direction of the deck and then lowered her head to the salt. The four stayed there about fifteen minutes and then wandered off. 

"Cam we follow them?" 

"We can, but we have to be careful to stop when they stop and not make any sudden moves or loud noises or we will spook them." 

We followed the four from fifty yards back for about an hour and a half as they wandered around chewing grass and eating the bark off of aspen trees. We started losing the light and turned and went back to the cabin. I fixed dinner and then we sat out on the deck and looked at the stars. I pointed out the North Star, and the Big and Little Dippers and a couple of bright spots that I thought were satellites because they never appeared to blink. 

The shocker came at bedtime. I started making up the couch and Kristal said: 

"No couch for you tonight fantasy boy. Tonight you share a bed with me." 

It was a good thing that I didn't have my hopes up. All she meant was that we would share the queen size bed. She wore sweats and I wore pajamas. One thing about that pot bellied stove. When it burned down and the ashes cooled it got downright chilly up there on the mountain. I woke up around two in the morning and found Kristal spooned up against me for warmth. It was very, very, very hard for me to behave. 

On the ride home Kristal said, "This is not turning out the way I expected." 

"And just what did you expect?" 

"I expected that each night would be a party somewhere so you could show off to as many people as possible." 

"My fantasy was to be with you. Just that, to be with you. Alone or with a bunch of people, just to be with you. I couldn't help the ball game because that was already planned before I knew you were coming. Ditto with the dinner at John's house and with Ken's retirement party tonight. To be absolutely honest here I never expected even in my wildest dreams that this would ever happen so I've just moved on with my life. However, I do plan on taking you out and showing you off on Saturday. We will be going out to dinner and then dancing. I hope you like Mexican food and country western dancing." 

"You are full of surprises sweetie. Symphony on one end, country music on the other and peaceful quiet mountains in the middle." 

I shrugged and paid attention to my driving.

Sexy and elegant. That is the only way to describe Kristal as she came into the living room ready to go to Ken's retirement party. A simple little black dress, a lone string of pearls and heels. She took my breath away. One thing was sure and that was no one at work was ever going to see me in the same light again. No more would they think "hard working, nose to the grindstone, stick in the mud Rob." 

You could hear the momentary hush as Kristal and I walked into the banquet room at the Hyatt. I had no idea if and of the men -- or women for that matter - - recognized Kristal, but I didn't care if they did. She was on my arm and all was well with my world. I got Kristal a martini from the bar and then we circulated and I introduced her to my coworkers. I didn't strut and I wasn't all puffed up like a peacock, but I have no doubt that everyone there knew how pleased I was over the attention that Kristal and I received. 

Then Barry, president and CEO of the company, called out that it was time to eat. After a prime rib dinner we had a drink and sat and listened to all the speeches and applauded when Ken received his going away gifts -- fly rod, creel and an Atlas to use for planning fishing trips and of course, the proverbial gold watch. After that it broke up into a cocktail party. 

I was surprise when Barry came up to us. I had been with the company six years and in all that time Barry had only spoken to me once. After some small talk Barry said: 

"I hope you aren't going to let this one get away Rob." 

I was even more surprised when Kristal laughed and said, "I've been trying to nail him down, but I can't get him to commit." 

Barry gave me an appraising glance and then moved off to talk with others. I turned to Kristal. 

"Can't get me to commit? We can be in Vegas in four hours and Elvis can do the honors." 

"Don't you wish." 

The silly part was yes, I did wish.

Saturday was a sleep in day and I didn't roll out of bed until a little after nine. I was making coffee when Kristal came into the room. Barefoot, tousled hair and nothing on but her Rockies jersey. I thought that I could stand seeing her like that for the rest of my life. She smiled at me and said: 

"In or out?" 

"In or out what?" 

"Breakfast here or out?" 

"Which would you prefer?" 

"Out. This is a lazy day and neither of us should do anything except lay around the house or pool." 

So that is what we did. We had breakfast at a Village Inn and then took the sun by the pool. I'm sure that Kristal in her bikini was the center of attention, but I've no way of knowing for sure since I couldn't take my eyes off of her long enough to see what other people were doing. 

After a light lunch we had to go shopping. All Kristal had packed were tennis shoes, flip flops and high heels none of which were suitable for country western dancing. She didn't want to go the boot route, but we did find a nice pair of flats with leather soles that would work just fine. 

We hit Three Margaritas for dinner and then we went to the Wagon Wheel. The live band there that week was Little Jimmy Hansen and the Barnyard Stompers. There were several people there that I knew and we ended up shoving several tables together and I introduced Kristal to everyone. I had gotten out of the habit of checking faces to see if anyone had a clue as to who my date was because I just didn't care. 

Kristal could two-step and waltz, but she didn't know any of the line dances and she didn't know western swing so we had a fun evening as we danced and I tried to teach her what I knew. There was a bit of a dark spot when Sally Fortner nudged me and said: 

"Don't look now, but your ex just walked in." 

Kristal heard her and asked "Where?" 

Sally pointed and I saw Joan sitting down at a table with two of her girlfriends. One of her girlfriends must have seen me and mentioned it to Joan and she looked our way and then quickly turned back to her friends. Kristal and I got up and went over and joined the line for a Tush Push and when it was over and the band moved into a waltz Kristal pulled me out onto the floor. 

"When we go by her tabled I want you molded to me." 

"You are evil?" 

"I know sweetie; it is part of my charm." 

We made a dozen turns around the floor and every time we went by Joan's table Kristal would be nibbling on my ear or nuzzling into my neck. I've no idea how Joan was taking it because I never looked her way. The waltz ended and we went back to our table and after a couple of minutes I got up to use the john and when I came back to the table I saw Josh Billings walking away from the table and everyone at the table laughing. Josh and I had never been friends. In fact, we couldn't stand each other. 

Before I could sit down Kristal stood up and pulled me out onto the floor for a two-step and as we went by Joan's table for the third time Kristal said: 

"She can't take her eyes off of you." 

"So?" 

"Nothing sweetie; it was just a comment." 

"It is you she is looking at and she is trying to figure out what a bombshell like you is doing with me." 

"It is you she is looking at sweetie. Trust me on this one. I know when someone is looking at me and she isn't." 

"No, you trust me on this. She isn't looking at me. She had me and I wasn't enough for her. All she is doing is wondering what a woman like you is doing with a guy like me." 

Kristal just shrugged and made no reply. 

About ten minutes later Ben Fortner asked Kristal to try a two-step with him and when they got out on the floor Sally pulled me up off my chair and we moved out on the floor. 

"Where on Earth did you find her Rob?" 

I told her the same story that Kristal had told my family. 

"And she flew here just to spend a week with you?" 

I shrugged. 

"Not that you aren't worth the trip baby, but she does seem to be a bit more than you.....oh never mind. I'm happy for you. I like her. We all like her and we love what she did to Josh." 

"What did she do to Josh?" 

"When you got up to go to the bathroom he came over and asked her for a dance. She politely said no and said her man -- that's what she called you, her man - - might not like it and to come back when you were there so you could either approve or not. And then Josh, asshole that he is, told her that she was wasting her time on a loser like you; that you weren't even man enough to hang onto your wife. She looked him right in the eye and told him that it wasn't your fault that your wife wasn't woman enough for you. And then she said, and this is an exact quote, "Do you think that I would fly here from LA to spend a week with a guy who couldn't get the job done? Fuck off asshole!" Everybody started laughing and Josh slunk off licking his wounds." 

"Go back to the point where you said "never mind." What were you going to say?" 

"Don't take this wrong Rob. You know that I love you like a brother, but I don't think the two of you could make it for the long haul. There is just something about her. I don't know what. Just a feeling, but she isn't wife material." 

"Maybe that is a good thing. Maybe I'm not husband material so maybe we would be a good fit." 

"Whatever baby; have your fun while you can." 

We were there another hour and then Kristal said we needed to be going. 

"I have a noon flight to catch lover and I still have to pack." 

We said our goodbyes and as we left I saw Joan watching us leave and I wondered what she was thinking. Sorry that she had fucked it up for us or wondering how a little dick like me ended up with a woman like Kristal. 

Kristal was quiet on the ride home and when we got there she kissed me on the cheek and went to her room. I undressed and was lying there looking up at the ceiling and going over the week in my mind when the bedroom door opened and Kristal came into the room. With the hallway light behind her I could see that she was naked. She walked over to the bed, pulled the covers off of me and got on the bed. I started to ask her what she was doing but before I could get a word out she placed a finger across my lips and said:  

===

"I know that this isn't supposed to be part of the deal, but I want to do it. I want your fantasy to be perfect." 

She took her finger from my lips, lowered her face and kissed me. 

It was incredible. We did everything but anal. She sucked my cock and I ate her pussy. We did it in the missionary position and when she had me back up for the second time we went cowgirl. We went sixty-nine and the third time was doggie and the forth was reverse cowgirl. The fifth was going to be anal, but my little guy just could not answer the call to duty. I do have to admit that the sex was not physically any better than the sex I had enjoyed with Joan and Annalise, but emotionally it was mind blowing. I actually got to make love to my fantasy woman and that in itself gave me an unbelievable high. We fell asleep wrapped in each other's arms and I slept like a baby. 

x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

The ride to the airport was silent for the first half of the trip and then Kristal said: 

"Your ex would kill to have you back." 

"Where did you get that silly idea?" 

"From her." 

I glanced over at her. 

"I followed her into the bathroom last night. I asked her why she was dumb enough to let you get away. She told me that it wasn't dumb; it was just plain stupid. A phone call sweetie and she's yours." 

"She was mine once before and I wasn't enough for her." 

"Don't give me that sweetie. You were more than enough for her and you know it. The problem here is your ego, your pride, your sense of self worth or whatever. She let someone else borrow something that you considered yours alone and it pissed you off. Let me tell you something lover. There isn't a woman in the world who hasn't heard that bigger is better and there isn't a woman who has heard that who hasn't wondered if it is true. Most never get the chance to find out and almost all who do get the chance take it. I know at least a dozen married women who have taken the chance, satisfied their curiosity without their husbands knowing and then have gone back to being loving and faithful wives." 

"You know a dozen?" 

"You've seen who I work with lover and you've seen what they have. We travel in the same circles so I see who they date and run around with. But here is the thing about huge cocks. The guys they are attached to are pursued by women who want to "know" and they don't have to work for their pussy the way guys like you have to. They don't have to go the 'wine and dine' route. They don't need to buy the flowers, cards and candy. They don't need to do any romancing so all the girl gets out of the deal is fucked. She finds out that bigger is indeed better, but that all the guy has to offer is a big dick and for most women that just isn't enough. They need love and affection and they need to be treated as a person and not just a piece of willing meat. 

"Your ex took the chance and satisfied her curiosity and if you hadn't found out it would have been over and done with and believe it or not your marriage would have been a lot stronger for it because she would have realized just what she had in you and what you brought to the table. You were the complete package and not just a large piece of meat. 

"But you did find out and pride and ego got into it. One more thing lover and then I'll shut up. I saw it and I know that one or two others at our table saw it. Any time you thought no one was looking your way you were looking at your ex. Deny it all you want, but something is still there." 

By then we were at the departure area and I pulled over and got Kristal's suitcases out of the trunk. She put her arms around me and gave me one hell of a hot kiss and then she said: 

"I had a blast lover and I'm glad I did it, but the bad news is that this is all there is going to be. No three or more weeks. One is all I can give and I hope it was memorable. Goodbye lover and good luck." 

She kissed me again and then I watched her walk away. 

x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

The following weeks were full of phone calls from people asking, "Do you have the slightest idea of who that was?" I couldn't stop for a drink after work without someone saying "You lucky dog you. How in the hell did you meet her?" Some women that I had been interested in at one time or another, but who hadn't been interested in me were saying "Call me. Maybe we can do lunch." 

I spent my nights reliving my week with Kristal and wishing that it could have lasted longer. If it would have it wouldn't have led to anything and I knew it. Kristal hadn't hidden her nature from me. One of the nights we sat on the couch and sipped martinis she told me why she was in 'the business.' 

"I love sex, I love variety, I love size and I get it all and get paid for it. For me it just doesn't get any better than that." 

Still, I could fantasize about a life with her and I did. 

Three days after Kristal flew back I got a call from Jerry. After his commission was taken out I would receive $16,560.00 for my idea. It wasn't lost on me that the amount covered what my week with Kristal had cost and then some. 

x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

But the fantasy had one more act to play. It was two months after my fantasy week had taken place. I was fixing dinner when the phone rang. My hands were busy so I pushed the button that put the phone on speaker. 

"Hello?" 

"Hi sweetie, miss me?" 

"You know I do." 

"Enough to want to see me again?" 

"What do you have in mind?" 

"An all expense paid week in Hollywood and a week's work in the entertainment industry." 

"Go on." 

"You know what a fluffer is in my business?" 

"She's the girl who gets the guys ready to perform, right?" 

"Right. I need a fluffer sweetie. Someone to warm me up and get me ready to take on the male star of my next video. I thought of you sweetie. Would you like the job?" 

"I'm sure that he would love the job" Joan said, "But I've got him back and I intend to keep him so thank you, but no thank you" and she pushed the button to disconnect. 

"That was rude. Shouldn't you have let me do my own talking?" 

"No way lover. No way could I trust you to say no to that sexpot. You are mine and I'll do whatever I have to do to keep you to myself." 

"A bit possessive are we?" 

"Damned straight lover, damned straight." Report_Story
