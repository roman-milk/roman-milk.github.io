FAWC 2: "We Gotta Stop Mom!" 

 (Author's note: This story is a submission to the second Friendly Anonymous Writing Challenge (FAWC).

 (The mystery ingredients for this story were: Ambition, Time of Day/Year, Ignorance, Color.) 

 * * * * 

 "I don't like that fuckin' bastard," Tiffany said, storming into my room. 

 "Knock much?" I snapped. 

 "Whatever, numb nuts. What're you worried about? Afraid I'm gonna walk in on you spankin' the monkey again?" 

 "What the fuck's your problem, Tiff?" 

 "That asshole boss from Mom's work. Why's he sniffin' around all the time now? And why does Mom let him get away with the shit he does?" 

 "What shit?" 

 "Fuck, Bret. You are so clueless. Don't tell me you haven't noticed." 

 I had no idea what she was talking about. Then again, for the last several years it seems I never did. 

 I don't know about this 'special bond' that twins are supposed to have. My older sister - by about 8 minutes - Tiffany and I fought like cats and dogs. She knew how to irritate me, just as I knew how to press all her buttons. Sometimes we went weeks without speaking. Ever since middle school. 

 I'd been getting the silent treatment for over a week now, which made this outburst all the stranger. The truth was, I didn't mind the silent treatment. I liked being left alone. It gave me time to work on what really mattered. For now, that was maintaining the GPA that would make me Valedictorian. Finish out this semester, and there'd be only one more to go. 

 "What was I supposed to notice?" I said, closing down the browser, since I wasn't gettin' any more studying done until she was dealt with. 

 "Mom's fuckin' around. With that ugly fat fuck." 

 That's my sister. Mouth like a sailor, and always jumping to conclusions. "You know that? You caught 'em?" 

 "If I did, don't you think I'd be talkin' to her instead of you? I wish. You must have noticed how she walks out of the room to take the calls on her phone. Disappears for hours with about a dozen different excuses. Started dressin' slutty. C'mon, are you that fuckin' stupid?" 

 Come to think of it, I had noticed the change in Mom's dressing habits. Skirts, heels, tighter shirts. Kind of embarrassing. Not that Mom's bad looking, or looks skanky, but some of my friends had been dropping the MILF bomb. Sick. 

 "So she dresses up? What's the big deal?" 

 "The way he stands so close to her, touching her. Whispering. The way she looks at him. Fuck, why am I talking to you? Class virgin. You wouldn't have a clue what flirting looks like." 

 "As the class slut, I'll have to defer to your expertise on this." 

 "Fuck you, dickless. I'm not a slut." 

 "Dickless? That's not what you said last time you came in unannounced." 

 She blushed. It had been out of character for her, to say the least. She walked in on me, squeezing one off, and stood staring in my doorway. I was so pissed at her, I didn't stop. I just glared at her, and stroked away. 

 She had blushed then, too. "Sorry," she had mumbled. Then she'd given me a little grin. "Guess I can't call you 'little' brother anymore." She'd actually left with a modicum of grace. Of course within the week she was giving me grief about it. 

 "What are we going to do about Mom, Bret?" She came in and sat down on my bed, and I could see this really bothered her. "Dad may be as clueless as you, but even he's going to figure out sooner or later. That won't be pretty. You want to spend our Christmases in two different houses? Dad has to pay for two households, there won't be any money for us or for college. Not like Mom makes more than chump change working for that asshole." 

 I turned my chair, facing her directly. "You really think it's that bad?" 

 She nodded sadly. "I do. I can't believe she'd do this to him. To us. She must know she's got it good. Why would she fuck up everything? I'm so pissed at her I could spit!" 

 "Alright, I believe you. Tell me again, why you think something's going on. I need details." 

 Tiffany and I were the opposite sides of a coin. I was the logical, calm, brainy one, a lot like Dad I guess. Pretty average looking, and not much of a socializer. Tiff was the explosive, emotional, wild one. Even though she's my sister, I can't deny she's good looking, a lot like Mom. Huge social network, tons of friends, always on twitter, facebook or messaging. Never pulls her face out of her phone; it's a miracle she noticed anything. 

 She was surprisingly detailed, giving it to me lock, stock and barrel. 

 1) Three times now she'd seen the bastard's - her words - car in our driveway when she came home from school early. She had PE last period, and often cuts, or leaves early, instead of cleaning up at school. He'd leave as soon as she arrived. 

 2) Mom's been secretive about her phone calls, sneaking off to answer them. She's been texting, which she never did much of, now it seems to be all the time. 

 3) She's been working extra hours at her part time job, about two times a week. No big deal, except she never worked late once, until the last 5 or 6 weeks. 

 4) The clothing. New, tighter, nicer. Heels. Makeup. Hair done every couple of weeks. Nail polish. 

 5) The way that Mom behaves around the bastard - again, Tiff's words - the few times she'd seen them together. All chummy and close. Too close. 

 6) Passwords on her phone and computer, which were never there before. 

 7) Way too good a mood, most of the time. 

 Now I knew she was really worried. She must have been hashing this out in her own brain for a while, to be able to give me an organized, point-by-point breakdown. 

 Afterward, she sat there anxiously. "What do you think? I'm not crazy, am I? I wish it weren't true." 

 I sat down beside her on the bed, looking at the list. "I don't know, sis. A lot of circumstantial evidence, but nothing solid. Doesn't look good though." 

 "What're we gonna do, Bret? Seriously. You've gotta be able to figure out something. Put that damn big brain of yours to some good use for once." 

 I gave it some thought. "Cracking her passwords shouldn't be any trouble. Tapping the front door video monitor would let us know who comes in the house. If I adjust the camera, we can probably see enough of the driveway to see when she's coming and going." 

 "Hard to do?" 

 "Nah. Tap the feed, and save it to hard-drive, I imagine. If anyone was lookin' for it, it'd be easy to spot, but around here?" 

 She nodded. "You don't think I'm nuts do you?" 

 God, for a moment she seemed like the Tiffany of old. Vulnerable, caring. I put my arm around her waist, and gave her a brief hug. "No, not at all. I'm glad you noticed. You're right, I probably never would have until it was too late. A little wrapped up in my own concerns at the moment. 

 "Let me see what I can do about tapping her phone GPS. I'll need to borrow your cell." 

 "Mine? Why?" she looked nervous. 

 "Yours is the same as hers, just the newer version. I can test it on yours. Don't worry, I'm not going to snoop on you." 

 "That's not what I was thinking," she snapped angrily. "I just don't want you messing with it." 

 Always so difficult. That's my sister. 

 I grabbed her hands in mine, and I noticed her palms were sweaty. She looked at me in surprise. 

 "Listen. This is serious. You're right about that. I know you don't like me, and you get on my nerves, but we don't have time for that right now. Truce, Ok?" 

 "Truce?" she mumbled. 

 "Please. At least until this is over. Then you can go back to torturing me. Truce?" 

 She nodded slowly. "I don't mean to torture you, Bret. I swear I don't. It's just, I don't know, the way you don't seem to care about anything, other than your grades, it drives me nuts. Like you're too good for everybody else." 

 I chuckled, giving her hands a squeeze before releasing them. "I get it. The way you care about everything, except your grades, does the same to me. This time it paid off. If it really is a problem, and we can stop it, I'll owe you." 

 She grinned. "Term paper, owe?" 

 "At least. It's our family, Tiff." 

 "Yeah. This is really fucked up." She stood. "Sorry to barge in on you. And you're definitely not dickless." She gave me a parting smile. 

 "Sorry I called you a slut. I know you're not." 

 She turned at the door. "Do you?" 

 The enigmatic comment had me wondering. What did I know about any of my family, including my sister? Shit, she was right, I was clueless! 

 * * * * 

 I got up, long after everyone had gone to bed, and went to work. I booted her computer from my OphCrack LiveCD. Twenty minutes later I had cracked her password. More complex than I would have thought from her, she must be a little paranoid. I logged in, testing it, and enabled the Windows Remote Desktop Connection. Pwned. 

 The Pattern lock was even easier. Took all of about 10 seconds to recognize the smudge pattern on her screen protector. Had it in two tries. 'M' for Mom I guess. How original. 

 Tapping the front door camera looked like more work than I wanted to get involved with, once I'd researched it. I went the lazy route and put my webcam in the window. Yawcam let me record a still every 3 seconds so it wouldn't eat up my hard-drive. Not the greatest resolution in the world, but more than enough for my purpose. 

 Now with that information, what to do with it? 

 The PC was easy, with Remote Desktop Connection enabled and her password. For the Phone, I needed to get it out of her control for a bit. There might have been other ways, but I don't know of them, or they cost money, and I don't have that much to spare. Webcam pics were timestamped, I'd just have to review them to see the comings and goings. 

 Enough for the night. I needed my rest. Third period AP Calculus exam. 

 * * * * 

 Tiffany popped into my room the following afternoon. Surprisingly she knocked first. Didn't wait for a response, but it was progress. 

 She shut the door behind her, conspiratorially. "When are you going to start?" she asked. 

 I sighed, closing my textbook. Studying was becoming nigh impossible with my sister on the rampage. "Done. Stop by tonight after everyone's in bed, and we can review everything on her PC and the camera pics." 

 "Done?" 

 "Yeah. Last night, late. We'll want to grab Mom's phone after she goes to bed. Can you manage that?" 

 She nodded. "You really did it that fast?" 

 "Sure. Around midnight?" 

 She grinned. "I guess all that time studying is good for something." 

 * * * * 

 It was midnight when she slipped into my room. Grandma's grandfather clock started its distinctive striking of midnight, deep and ringing. People sleeping over for the first time always commented on it. When you lived with it every day of your life, it was no big deal. It became part of the background. 

 The sonorous reports covered the noise of her moving around. She slid in the door, closing it behind her. Without knocking of course. I had the bedside light on, and a towel across the bottom of the door so nobody could see the light. 

 "Put the towel back," I told her nodding toward the door. 

 She didn't give me any lip, or ask why. She leaned over and stretched it across the gap. The t-shirt she slept in gave me a peek at her pink panties. She might not be a slut, but she certainly had the body of one. Nice butt. 

 Eeew! Did I really think that? 

 I scooted over on the bed, and patted the space beside me, shifting the laptop in my lap. "Bring the phone?" 

 She held it out to me. 

 I unlocked the pattern and gave it back. "Check her messages. Call history too." 

 I was reviewing Mom's emails. They were pretty damning. I looked over at the phone to see how sis was doing. She was sitting cross legged, her phone in her lap. I had a pretty good crotch view. That pretty pink swatch called out to me. I reached over and tugged her t-shirt down to cover it. 

 "Hey!" she snapped, slapping at my hand. 

 "Shhh," I whispered. "Sorry about that, but I don't need the distraction." 

 She looked at me oddly, then grinned. "You little sicko, you were checking out my cooch!" 

 "Cute," I said, scanning the emails. "But not something you need to be showing your brother." 

 "I wasn't showing..." 

 "Truce, remember? I had an accidental eyeful, Ok? I thought it appropriate to cover it. No big deal. I probably should have just told you, I wasn't thinking, alright? Sorry." 

 She adjusted the bottom of her shirt. "No, I overreacted. Kind of cool, really. My brother the fuckin' gentleman. Most guys would have enjoyed the view." 

 "Most guys didn't bathe with you naked for years." 

 "Pervert," she whispered, but she was smiling. "Bet you wish you still did." 

 "Wouldn't get much washing done," I teased. 

 "Oh my God! You didn't! You really are perving on me!" 

 "Just teasing, Tiff. I may be clueless about women, but even I can't help but notice you have a smokin' hot bod." 

 "You think so?" 

 "Duh." 

 She was scrolling through the texts. "This is bad. You got anything?" 

 "Some pretty raunchy emails, mostly from him. But she just laughs him off. I don't think Mom's doing him yet, but from the looks of these, it probably won't be long." 

 "Yeah. Same here. The bastard's telling her how hot she is. How smart and pretty. Misunderstood. He'll be there for her, whatever she needs. What a team they'll make. Yuck." 

 "I know. Listen to this reply. 'Greg, don't be so naughty! You'll get me all hot and bothered!! Then what am I supposed to do? Wait another two weeks before he does his duty?'" 

 "Did he reply?" 

 "Yeah. 'Why wait, when with one little yes, you could get two hours of serious satisfaction, with a real cock for once.'" 

 "Fuck. What a jerk! What could she possibly see in him? Dad's a lot better lookin' and from the sounds of things coming out of their bedroom, they don't wait two weeks between rounds." 

 Tiffany was still reading. "Fuck me! This is bad." 

 "What?" 

 "'Can't stop thinking about those amazing tits of yours. Are you sure you're 43? You have the titties of a teenager. And those nipples! Don't get me started. Sweeter than gumdrops. When am I going to get to taste the rest???' The bastard's been playing with Mom's tits. What the fuck is wrong with her?" 

 "Her reply?" 

 "'Behave you sweet man. You know that was an accident. Should never have happened. (giggle) I do have to admit, that's some nice lumber you're packing away in your Jockeys. Don't you DARE whip it out like that again. I don't care HOW hard I make you.' I think I'm going to throw up now." 

 "FUCK! I'm blind!" Tiffany whined a few seconds later. 

 "What!?" 

 She turned the phone so I could see. "'This is how hard you make me, sugarnips. All the time.' That's lumber? Skinny ugly dick like that?" 

 The picture wasn't all that flattering. Disturbing that he sent it. More disturbing that Mom kept it. 

 "Shit. If Mom thinks that's lumber, she'd have a heart attack if she saw the Giant Sequoia you're sporting, bro." She scrolled through more texts. "You're not raging one now, are you?" 

 She said it casually, but I saw her glance over. 

 "No, but if you keep talking about it, it won't be my fault." 

 She giggled. "Big sister gettin' you all hot and bothered, talking about big hard cocks and tasty nipples?" 

 "Truce? Remember?" 

 She pouted. "I'm not being mean. Think it's kind of cool that little bro ain't so little. You hard yet?" 

 I sighed theatrically. "Yes, happy?" 

 "Prove it." 

 "Tiff!" I hissed. 

 "You saw my cameltoe. Let me see your lump." 

 "No way." 

 "C'mon, Bret. I never got a really good look that one time. You wouldn't stop beatin' it long enough. I'm just curious." 

 "Curiosity killed the cat," I told her in my infinite, lust shrouded, clichéd wisdom. 

 "That curious thing might not kill the pussy, but I bet it could do some serious damage to it." 

 "Enough Tiff. We've got work to do here. This is really bad. Dad gets wind of this, and we're talking serious trouble." 

 "Spoilsport." She reached down and pulled her t-shirt back, exposing her naughty pink panties. "I don't mind." 

 I moved my laptop to the side, and turned to face her. "Seriously. I can't think straight. Please don't tease me." 

 She turned partway, and put her hand on my knee. "Sorry. I wasn't teasing. I would like a look, but if it bothers you so much, I'll drop it." She looked disappointed, maybe even sad. "Do I disgust you that much? Is it 'cause you think I'm a slut? Because I'm not." 

 "You don't disgust me at all. Just the opposite. That's the problem. And I don't think you're a slut. Popular, yes. Slutty, no." 

 "I'm not a virgin, but I don't sleep around." 

 I could feel my face burning up. 

 "Two guys, neither very good, to be honest. Johnny four times. Dave twice. That's it. Your slutty sister's had sex six times. Hasn't had a good fucking yet." 

 It was her turn to blush. "Pretty small dicks, too. I guess that's why yours has me curious." 

 "Jeez, Tiff! It's not huge or anything." 

 "A lot bigger than the ones I've seen. All five." 

 "Five? Suddenly we've gone from two to five?" 

 "Two handjobs, and a blowjob. I'd just as soon forget the names." 

 "Slut," I teased. I nudged her knee so she knew I was joking. 

 "Geek," she responded. "Big dicked Geek. How big, bro?" 

 "I don't know," I said. 

 "Bullshit. All guys measure them, then add at least an inch." 

 "I haven't. I swear." 

 "Liar." 

 I got a little irritated. "Not everyone is as concerned with their sexual apparatus as you." 

 "'Sexual apparatus.' God, you're fuckin' unbelievable." She got up from the bed, and walked out of the room. 

 Great. Well, at least I should be able to finish reading the emails. 

 Or not. She returned after just a couple of minutes. She sat down next to me again, facing me this time. "We're going to measure it." 

 "No." 

 "Yes. You can fight it, but if you do, truce or no truce, I'll torture you 'til I get my way. You know I always get my way. Let me measure it, and I swear I'll leave you alone for the rest of the night." 

 "The rest of the night?" 

 She nodded, grinning. "Best offer you're gonna get. Don't make me get physical with you." Memories of us wrestling together as kids flooded my brain. Good memories. We'd been so close once. Sad, that we'd lost that closeness. 

 Fuck. I put the laptop to the side, and slid my shorts down. I was already standing tall. Truth be told, I'd been working with one hand while she was gone, the other in my shorts. 

 She grinned, and before I knew what the hell she was up to, she shed her t- shirt, letting me see her full tits uncovered, for the first time since before they were big enough to dent her shirt. Damn, she had some fine titties. 

 "Little reward for participating. Thank you. Now take off yours, it's in the way." 

 I sighed grievously, but pulled off my shirt, leaving me naked, next to my sister, who was only wearing very small panties. Simple pink triangle, that looked almost innocent. Almost. 

 She unrolled the measuring tape with a flick of her wrist. She leaned over, pressing the end to the base of my cock, just below my stomach. Her hand moved under my cock, pressing my balls back, while her thumb held the end of the tape in place. She slowly stretched it out, her delicate hand cupping the head of my cock, while her thumb and forefinger held the tape stretched out. The sensations were driving me nuts. 

 She moved her face closer, until I could feel her breath on my aching hardness. "A little over 8 inches. Maybe 8 1/2. I thought it was bigger, like 10 inches. It looks huge." Her hands were moving slightly, not letting me go.  

 

 

===

"Not so big," I said. "The average is around six, right? So I'm only a couple of inches longer." 

 "And twice as thick." She released the tape, stroking my cock firmly once, from base to tip. "Messy boy," she teased, as I started to leak from the end. 

 "We done now?" I pleaded, trying to stifle any moans. 

 "Not quite yet. Need to see how big around you are." Tiffany stretched the tape around the middle, getting even closer to read it. That pretty face, inches from my cock, full tits, hanging down, rose colored nipples poking out. Damn. 

 "Six and a half. I don't know what the average is, but I know it's a lot less than that. Jesus, bro, 6.4 divided by 3.14... that makes you over 2" across." She wrapped her fingers around the shaft, and moved them up and down slowly. She giggled. "Little 'big' bro's sportin' a 2x8 in his pants. Impressive." Her hand gave a little squeeze, and continued its travels 

 "Stop," I gasped. "You have to stop now." 

 She smiled mischievously, thrusting her chest out. "Stop this? Why?" she asked, her hand moving just a little faster. 

 I groaned, thrusting back against her hand, trying to hang on. 

 "Still want me to stop, 'big' brother?" she teased. 

 I shook my head, my hand reaching out to touch her. 

 "Say it. Tell me what you want me to do." 

 I groaned when her hands stopped moving. "More," I pleaded softly. 

 She inched closer to me, her leg pressing against mine. I put my hand on her soft thigh. So smooth and soft. Her hands moved a little faster, and I was a goner. 

 "Gonna..." 

 "...come for me?" she asked, her voice filled with excitement. 

 "Uhhn," I moaned, and erupted, shooting high into the air, two large and messy volleys, followed by a few more that didn't do much more than clear the head, and spill over her hand. 

 She was giggling, her head leaning against my shoulder, while her hand milked me dry. 

 When I was done, I was surprised by a little kiss on my neck. "How do you usually clean up?" she asked. 

 "Paper towels, under the bed," I sighed, leaning back against the headboard. 

 She climbed off of me, one hand cupped under the other to catch any mess, and was soon wiping her hands dry. When she was done with that task, she pulled off several sheets, and started cleaning me up. She chuckled as my cock twitched and started to expand. 

 "Naughty boy. Coming all over me like that. Looks like he wants to go again." 

 She dumped the messy paper towels in the trash, and left the bedroom again, returning a short time later with a wet washcloth, which she used on both of us. "Didn't know you'd make that big a mess," she said quietly, washing my now very hard erection. 

 "Don't usually," I confessed, embarrassed. 

 "That was because of me?" she teased. 

 I reached out and gave her tit a squeeze. "You know it, trouble-maker." 

 She pouted. "You're not mad at me, are you?" 

 I pulled her close, hugging her. "You know I can never stay mad at you, Tiff." 

 She hugged me back. "I didn't mean to take it that far. Sorry, I... I got carried away." 

 "It's Ok." 

 Her eyes bugged out in surprise, when I tilted up her chin and kissed her on the lips. "We used to be so close. What happened?" I asked. 

 "I don't know," she whispered. "We lost each other. Me with all my friends, and you, always self-sufficient, nose in the books." 

 I kissed her again, and she responded, her mouth opening, her tongue tracing my lips and teeth, parting them, reaching into my mouth. I remembered my first real kiss with her. Seventh grade. When we would practice with each other. When she pulled away, she rested her head on my shoulder, next to mine. "We're going to have to work on that. You're a lousy kisser, Bret." 

 "Sorry. I've never had much opportunity to practice." 

 "None?" 

 "Not really. Not like that one." 

 I grabbed her leg and lifted, pulling her sideways, onto my lap, straddling me. She shifted forward, until her warm crotch was pressed against my hard-on. Little pink swath of cloth all that separated us. "I want my twin back," I told her. 

 "I never went anywhere," she whispered, kissing my chin. 

 My hands caressed her back, as she leaned against me. "You better go soon, or I won't be responsible for my actions." 

 She gave me a little nip on the shoulder with her teeth. "Perving on me again?" 

 "Still," I told her. 

 She giggled, pressed her lips to mine quickly, then climbed off. "I'm going to put Mom's phone back and get some sleep. We'll talk again tomorrow night, alright?" 

 I nodded. "I'm going to read the emails for a while longer. We can decide on a plan tomorrow night. Think about it between now and then, Ok?" 

 She pulled her shirt back on, casually, adjusting it. "Thanks for believing me, and doing all the work here." 

 "No problem. I have as much vested in this as you do." 

 "Good night, big bro." 

 "Night, big sis." 

 * * * * 

 The next day I was in a fog. Thinking about Tiffany, and what had happened. What it meant, if anything. About what Mom was up to, and what we could do about it. What would happen if we failed. Thank God I had no serious work to do that day. That's the last thing I needed. I already had my Merit Scholarship, and had to choose where to use it. Letting the grades slip at the last moment wasn't in the cards. Valedictorian, baby. Number one. I'd sacrificed my high- school social life to ensure that. I wasn't about to screw it up now. Not for anything. 

 I'd been trying to play it cool, but Mom noticed something was wrong. 

 "What's wrong, Bret? Did I forget to bathe today?" she asked, as I moved past her in the kitchen, avoiding contact. 

 "What?" 

 "No hug, no 'How's it going,' no talk about your school day. No nothin'." 

 I gave her a quick hug, wondering if "Greg" had beaten me to it that day. "Just distracted, I guess. Loads of school work." 

 "Mmmm, that's better," she said smiling, when I released her. 

 She was dressed nicer again. I decide to start pushing a little. "You look really good. You and Dad going out somewhere special?" 

 I could tell she was surprised. "N...No, I thought it would be nice to dress up a little more. Don't you like it?" 

 I nodded. "All the guys do. Believe me, they noticed. You're becoming the number one MILF, from the sounds of things." 

 She turned red. She definitely knew what a MILF was. "They said that?" 

 "Sure. Always dressing up like you're going out on the town, nice makeup, new hairdos, sexy clothing. You trying to spark up the marriage?" I didn't wait for an answer, taking my snack and heading for my bedroom. I leaned in and gave her a kiss on the cheek. "Dad's a lucky guy, married to a hottie." 

 In the bedroom, I was curious, because of her outfit. I checked the camera pics, and sure enough, she'd come home from her work around 1:00, and at 1:36 that afternoon, she'd gone out in her outfit, and hadn't returned until 3:52, only a few minutes before I got home. I doubted she was with him the whole time. He certainly didn't look like the kind of guy who could go for 2 hours, but then again, what did I know? Probably did some shopping. She had bags she brought in when she returned. I couldn't make them out on the pictures. Wish I could afford a better camera. 

 A quick perusal of her email, showed nothing new, to or from the Fat Bastard. 

 I realized I needed to know more about the guy, and started investigating. 

 Tiffany walked into my room, casual as can be, and flopped down on the bed. "Any news?" 

 "Nothing firm. I think she met him for a late lunch. She went out for a few hours, dressed up. No emails," I explained. 

 "I hope it wasn't funch," Tiffany said. 

 "Funch?" 

 "What? A word 'Mr. Vocabulary' doesn't know?" 

 "It's not a word. Definitely not in the Scrabble dictionary." 

 She rolled her eyes at me. "Funch. Fucking plus lunch. Funch. Jesus, we gotta get you a life." 

 "Got one, thanks. One that'll pay off in the long run," I smirked. Remembering our truce, I continued. "We'll have to wait 'til tonight to get her phone. She was on it when I got home, and walked out to the back porch, practically whispering." 

 I told her about what I'd done, the comments about Mom's outfit. Tiffany grinned. "Hopefully that got her thinking, and not in the wrong way. Don't need to come home to see her getting gang-banged by your nerd friends." 

 I ignored the slam. Truce. "What do you think we should do?" I asked. 

 "I'm thinking we keep monitoring her, do what we can to make her nervous, and start interfering where we can. Maybe with enough guilt and fear of getting caught, she'll kill it before it goes too far." 

 "I'm thinking the same, plus I want to find out everything I can about Fat Bastard." 

 Tiffany giggled. "Fat Bastard is right. Jesus, what does she see in the ugly fat fuck? I don't get it." 

 "Me either," I agreed. 

 "So we don't confront her?" Tiffany asked. 

 "With what? Suspicions? Some emails and text messages that will tell her we're spying on her? I don't think so. Not yet at least." 

 She nodded. "Going out. I'll be back for dinner. See you tonight," she said. She acted as if nothing had happened between us the night before. 

 "Later," I replied, trying to keep it cool. 

 I finished my schoolwork and worked on the GPS situation. Couldn't find anything free, but for about $4.00 a month, I found a program on Google Play that would monitor the GPS, track SMS and call logs, and a bunch of other stuff. Now if only I had a credit card. 

 Rather than try anything crazy, I thought I'd be just a little sneaky. 

 Mom was making dinner, and Dad had gotten home, and was parked in front of the TV, already dressed down for the evening. Mom was still dolled up, and I started to wonder how Dad couldn't notice. I had a sudden surge of fear. What if he had noticed? What if he was doing what we were? I had a sudden urge to research Dad as well. 

 I hunted down Mom. 

 "Mom?" 

 "Yes, honey?" 

 "Could I get a prepaid credit card? I could use it to pay for my tests and college applications, without bothering you guys all the time." 

 "You know you can have my card, whenever you need it," she said absentmindedly. 

 "I know, but I thought it would be good to start learning how to use one, budgeting, tracking my expenses, all that stuff. I'm going to need one when I go to college." 

 "I don't have a problem with it. Why don't you ask your father? If he's Ok, I think that would be great." 

 Damn, the old 'if your mother/father doesn't mind' ploy. 

 I planted myself next to Dad, and during the commercial I gave him the same pitch. 

 "I can just put you on my account," he said, thinking it over. 

 "I know, but then I won't be responsible for my own bills." 

 "How much would you need?" 

 "Each college app, including sending SAT and AP scores looks like it averages just under $100. CLEP tests are about the same, a hundred bucks." 

 "How many you plan on applying for?" he asked. 

 "Maybe half-a-dozen colleges, and four CLEPs that I know of." 

 He whistled. "A thousand dollars?" 

 "It will let me skip four classes. With my AP courses, that's close to a year and a half of college saved." 

 "You starting, soon?" 

 "In the next few weeks. A prepaid card is reloadable, so I can start with just enough to get going, and add to it as needed." 

 "Let me look into it. When do you need it?" 

 "As soon as possible. I was hoping to start some of the applications this weekend." 

 He seemed surprised by that. "Really? We haven't talked about it." 

 "The school adviser thinks I can go to a lot of schools free. I want to start checking on that." 

 Dad laughed. "Free would be good. Think you can get a free ride for your sister?" 

 "I can only work small miracles, Dad. That's beyond me." 

 "Alright. I'll see what I can do." 

 * * * * 

 On the ninth stroke of midnight I was getting anxious before Tiffany showed up again. She was already scrolling through Mom's text messages. "Miss me, bro?" 

 "You even miss a headache when it's gone," I teased. 

 She stuck her tongue out at me, and hopped on the bed next to me. "Bingo. You were right. Lunch with Fat Bastard." 

 "Messages?" 

 "Before and after. Confirming their plans, and then revisiting all the kissy- face and fondling afterward. Mom's such a slut." 

 "How bad?" 

 "Bad, but not horrible. Listen to this: 'Do you have any idea how badly I wanted to tear off your shirt, seeing your nipples hard like that? No bra? You can be such a tease.'" 

 "That's not too bad," I said. 

 "Oh yeah? 'You were a beast! I told you no marks. How am I supposed to explain a hickey on my boob?'" 

 "I got an email. She says that she'll meet him on Monday at 6:00. Wonder what kind of excuse she'll give Dad?" 

 "I don't know. Want to mess it up for her?" 

 "How?" 

 "I don't know. Shouldn't be too hard. Commit her to something she doesn't know about until either Sunday or Monday. You're the guy with the big brain, you can figure it out." 

 "Alright. At least we have a little time. I should have the GPS locator on her phone this weekend with any luck. I want to review all her old emails, see what I can find out about Fat Bastard, as well as when and how this started." 

 She finished scanning the phone. "Three calls with him today. He called twice, she called once. One was more than 30 minutes long." 

 "Wish I knew what they were saying, but that's a lot more difficult. Expensive from what I've been researching." 

 She put the phone aside, and moved close to me, her arm around my waist. "I've been thinking..." 

 "Mmmhmm?" 

 "You're right. I want my twin back too. Sorry I've been such a pain for so long. Forgive me?" 

 "Of course." 

 "You gonna be reading those emails long?" 

 "Tiffany..." 

 She giggled. "C'mon, you know you loved it." 

 "We shouldn't be doing this. You know that." 

 "Just fooling around a little. I have to see it. See if I can make it shoot like that again. We can be more careful about making a mess." She tickled my ribs. "Besides, you need some serious training in the kissing department." 

 Truth was, I'd been hoping for a repeat. "Nothing crazy, Ok?" 

 She grinned, then pulled my head down for a quick kiss. "I promise. Now get undressed for me." 

 I put the laptop away, and stripped off my sleeping shorts and t-shirt. Tiffany took off her shirt, and she was naked, except for those same pink panties. She started peeling them off. 

 "Tiff, you promised." 

 "Loosen up, Bret. It's not like you haven't seen it before. We're not going to fuck. I just figured if you're naked, I should be as well." 

 "Leave the panties on. They're cute," I said, hoping the little added comment would mollify her. It worked. 

 She grinned, tugging at them. "You like? Makes me seem almost innocent, doesn't it?" 

 "Except for that amazing body. Kind of blows the innocent thing all out of the water." I reached down and teasingly pulled at the waistband. "Aren't these kind of ripe, sis? I've seen the same ones for three days." 

 She stuck her tongue out at me. "I don't think so. Most of mine are the same. I like these. Why should I wear a different style?" 

 "You shouldn't. Trust me," I teased. 

 She climbed in my lap, arms and legs around me. "Kissing 101, to start." 

 Best class I ever took. She taught me what she liked, and by the time I noticed the clock it was after 1:00 and I'd been achingly hard for at least half an hour. 

 "Alright. Getting better. You were always a quick learner. Now just lay back and let me play with my new toy for a while." 

 She'd been stroking my cock for a few minutes when she asked me if I ever used lotion. I didn't, I confessed, and I lost her for a couple of minutes before she returned with a bottle of moisturizer. Brazen girl, running around the house nearly naked. The lotion felt heavenly and after only a few minutes, she had me ready to shoot. 

 "Getting close," I warned her. 

 "Good." 

 She rested her head on my hip, getting a good close look, while her hand repeated the tantalizing motion up and down my shaft. She pressed her lips against my skin, and looked up at me. "Come for me?" 

 "Uh-huh," I moaned softly, and bit my lip as she got her wish. 

 She was more careful with the outcome, leaving the mess on my chest and belly. She pulled out the paper towels, and cleaned me up. 

 "Did you like that?" she teased. 

 "You know I did." 

 "Kissing refresher?" 

 I pulled her up, and took my exam. She was half lying on me, her leg between mine, moving sinuously. She nibbled my ear. "My turn?" she whispered. 

 My hands had been caressing her skin, gently brushing her chest. I rolled her onto her back, and explored her breasts, squeezing, licking, kissing. 

 "You can be a little rougher. I don't mind." 

 I sucked her nipples powerfully, seeing how much of her tit I could fit in my mouth. Bit down a little to feel her squirm. "How big are they?" I asked. 

 She giggled. "It that all you guys think about? I'm a solid C-cup." 

 I slowly moved my hand down between her legs, wondering if she'd stop me. She opened them wide. "Gentler down there, at least to start. Touch me, Bret." 

 It was incredibly exciting, sliding my fingers inside her panties, feeling the satiny soft flesh inside of her, the moistness bathing my fingers. I was pumping them in and out of her, feeling how deeply I could reach. 

 "Not too much fingering," she whispered. "Touch all around. You might want to rub the top area a little." 

 "Your clit?" 

 "Yeah, not too hard on it. I get real sensitive." 

 For several minutes, my mouth enjoyed her tits, while my fingers played below. 

 She was started to squirm a little pressing back against me. "Kiss me," she pleaded. 

 Her tongue was in my mouth, brushing against mine, when her mouth opened and I felt the gasp that preceded her coming for me. 

 She nibbled my bottom lip. "You're much better at that. Thanks." 

 In that moment, I realized how much time we'd lost. I rolled onto my back, pulling her with me, until she was lying on my chest. I kissed her a while, my hands exploring her backside. 

 "You know I love you, right?" I told her. 

 She nodded, her lips leaving a trail of kisses across my face. "I know. Me too." She grinned. "No need to get sappy about it." 

 "Brat." 

 She giggled. "I'm going to do you again. Let's see if we can make it last a while. We need to teach you some staying power." 

 I did a little better. About 7 minutes according to the clock. She was pleased with that, as she cleaned me up the second time. "Better. When you can last 10 minutes, we'll see if we can't up the ante." 

 I didn't ask her what that meant. 

 Once she'd departed, I knew I needed more analysis. I connected Mom's phone to my laptop, and downloaded all her texts. Tiffany had been reading them, and it's not that I didn't trust her, but her thinking was pretty straightforward. I wanted to see if I could get anything else out of the messages. 

 I could still smell her on the pillow next to me, as I went to sleep, ridiculously content, considering Mom might be in the middle of blowing up the family. 

 * * * * 

 The analysis was worthwhile. I was jotting down the essentials, when Tiffany the Magnificent came bouncing into my bedroom. She bounded onto the bed. "What's up?" she asked. "You never, ever, come out of your cave anymore. Someone's going to get suspicious." 

 "I think I got it," I said. 

 "Got what?" 

 "Why she's doing it." 

 "No shit?" She leaned against me, looking at the computer screen. "Those are her texts," she said. 

 "Yeah. It's sneaky. There's hints, but he doesn't come out and say it. Not in writing." I flipped to the second tab. "More important, we didn't look at Aunt Tina's texts." 

 "Aunt Tina? Why?" 

 "She knows all about it, and I think she knows why." 

 "So you gonna keep being a dick, or you gonna tell me?" 

 "Being a 'dick'? I spent three hours reviewing this, and I'm still not finished." 

 "Big brainy dick." She giggled. "And I meant that in the nicest way. Now spill."  

 

 

===

"He's given her two raises. He's paying her for almost full-time work, when she really puts in 4-5 hours a day. Promising her one of the jobs when her co- worker retires in the next six months." 

 "So she's a whore. He pays her, she screws around." 

 "Not so far. He wants her bad. She laughs about it with Aunt Tina. She was just leading him on, but now she's feeling a little guilty, and considering paying him off. It sounds like the full-time job offer was the kicker he needed to land her." 

 "A whore in training. Slut-Mom," Tiffany said 

 "It's more than that. She was feeling," I looked up the text, "unappreciated, unloved, and unfulfilled." 

 Tiffany sat back, leaning against the headboard. She was wearing a skirt, and I leaned over and lifted the end, peeking. 

 "Bret!" she whined, slapping the material down. 

 "Just checking. Wanted to see if you'd changed the panties yet." 

 She stuck her tongue out at me. "Stop. Save it for later. This is serious." 

 "I know. I think she's close to doing it." 

 "She can't! We gotta stop her." 

 "Won't do much good if we do. If she's feeling like she is, anyone paying her enough attention would probably get to her." 

 "This sucks! What are we gonna do?" She cuddled up to me. "I bet you have some idea, don't you brainy bro?" 

 "Not yet. I'm still gathering info. Let me work on it." 

 "Tonight?" she whispered, her breath warm against my ear. 

 "Sure," I said, trying to act nonchalant. 

 She gave me a peck on the cheek. "You're not fooling me. You're looking forward to my visit even more than I am, and you know it." 

 I didn't answer. I didn't need to. We both knew she was right as rain. 

 The beginning of a plan was starting to form, an hour later. I shut everything down, and searched out Mom. The least I could do was work on her feelings. 

 She was in the laundry room, unloading the dryer. Dressed nicely again, wearing a skirt that was a little short for public, she was bent over at the waist, and I saw the tops of stockings. Not pantyhose, but stockings. I slid my arm around her waist. "Let me help you Mom." 

 She was startled, but smiled for me. "So you are alive." 

 I lifted the clothes basket on top of the dryer, turned and gave her a big hug. She looked surprise, but was grinning. "What was that for?" 

 "Because I love you, and don't tell you often enough what a great Mom you are. I appreciate everything you do, to make this family what it is. I know it must be a pain. Cooking, cleaning, and working." 

 She blushed, since I was still holding her. "We all share chores," she said. "Your father helps a lot." 

 "You need to offload some of this to Tiff and me. Make a little time for yourself. You and Dad both work too hard. Live a little, Mom!" I gave her a little shake. 

 "I don't know what's gotten into you," she laughed. 

 "Nothing. I just look at the families of my friends. Houses without love. Broken families. Parents working on their third marriages. And I think about what we have here, two parents who love each other, and love us. I'm so lucky. I wouldn't trade places with anybody." 

 "Well, I'm pretty lucky too. Such wonderful children." She had stopped leaning away from me, and let me pull her close. Her arms slid around my waist, her head pressed against my chest. 

 I kissed her cheek. "I got this. Go relax. Kick your shoes off. You deserve it." 

 She gave me a squeeze. "What did I ever do to deserve such a wonderful boy?" she whispered. 

 "The question is, what did I ever do to deserve the best, most loving, and hottest Mom in world." 

 She giggled. "I'm not 'hot' Bret." 

 "That's not what the guys are saying." 

 She raised one eyebrow, smirking. "And just what are the 'guys' saying?" 

 "MILFilicious. Eye-candy. Sexiest Mom in town. Cougar dream." 

 I still hadn't let her go. Her hands were resting against my chest, but from the waist down, we were still pressed together. She looked up at me, curious. "Cougar dream?" 

 "You know. Cougars. Mature women who date younger men. You're the fantasy. I think some of them would hit on you, if it wasn't so obvious how in love with Dad you are, and that you could never cheat on him. They get too crazy, I straighten them out." 

 "Crazy? How?" 

 "Crazy talk. Dirty talk. I won't let them talk about you like that. Dressing nice doesn't mean anything. You've got a great body, it makes sense you'd want to show it off a little. Doesn't make you a slut or on the prowl." 

 "They... they say things like that?" 

 "They're just jealous that their Mom's don't look or dress like you do. None of them." I let her go. "Go on. Get out of those sexy work clothes, and relax. I'll finish in here." 

 Mom nodded, and started to walk away. I saw one more opportunity to poke at her. Sexy little red lace panties. I lifted them. "Hey Mom, maybe you should talk to Tiffany. She's getting pretty wild. I mean, seriously? Panties like these? A little over the top aren't they?" 

 She turned red. "They're not that bad, Bret." 

 "You're kidding, right? She's advertising. Everyone's going to think she's a slut." 

 "I... I'll talk to her," Mom mumbled. 

 In the load of delicates were four different pair of pink bikini panties, and two more pair of racy, lacy, naughty ones. I was certain I knew which belonged to whom. Thank God for Tiffany paying attention to what was going on. I only hoped we weren't too late. 

 After dinner, Dad gave me a credit card. "Use it wisely. I'm going to trust you not to be wasteful. It's got a $1000 limit, prepaid." 

 I was a little surprised at the rapid response. Tiffany was watching and had a cow. "A credit card? How come he gets a credit card!" 

 "It's for his college applications, Sugar," Dad reassured her. 

 "What about mine?" she whined. 

 Dad gave her a knowing look. "You're thinking of going to college?" 

 She blushed. "Of course! Why not?" 

 "Did you even take your SATs? What about your grades? Where did you have in mind?" Dad asked. 

 "I figured wherever. Maybe UT, it's not like there's any rush is there?" 

 Dad looked over at me. 

 "Tiff, early admission has already ended for a lot of schools. I'd say that for about a third of them, and most of the better ones, the application deadline for fall admittance is January first. That's less than five weeks away. The last SAT test date this year is December 7th, and registration for that one is already closed." 

 She looked confused. "Some schools are later than January 1st, aren't they?" 

 I nodded. "A lot of them. I'll be honest. I thought you were going the Community College route. You never talk about university. You should have been taking your SATs long ago. It took me five tries to get my 2400." 

 "What about the ACT?" she asked. 

 "Test registration for the December test was November 22nd," I explained. A week ago. 

 "I... I can't believe none of you told me!" she whined. "Like I don't matter. Only Bret. Smart Bret, special Bret! It's not fair!" she finally screamed, marching out of the room. 

 I felt bad for her. She was right. Our parents never pressed either of us very hard. I worked at school because I wanted too. Somebody should have been lighting a fire under my sister's butt about six months earlier. 

 Mom and Dad were looking at each other with concern. 

 "I'll talk to her. I know what's going on. I'll take care of it. If she wants to go to college it's not a problem, is it?" 

 Dad shook his head. "No, we'll manage somehow. I don't know about a $50K a year private school, but we'll figure out something." 

 "Good. Let me deal with it." 

 Mom looked worried. "You can help her, Bret?" 

 "Yeah. I painted a pretty bleak picture. Lots of schools have later admission, rolling admissions, that kind of stuff. Worse comes to worse, we can get her into the community college, and fix her grades and test scores before working on a four year plan." 

 I knocked on her door, and opened it when she didn't answer. She glared at me. "Here to rub it in, Mr. Perfect?" 

 I closed the door and sat on the bed beside her. "How come you never said anything about college, Tiff?" 

 She pouted. "What, I'm too stupid for college now?" 

 "I never said that. Hell, you're as smart as me, you just don't apply yourself. You could get in anywhere you wanted, with a little effort." 

 "So it's too late now, I guess." 

 It wasn't. We talked. Talked about her future for the first time. What time constraints we were working with, what courses she'd need, the tests she'd need to take in January, what she wanted to do, all the stuff that should have been discussed a year earlier. 

 A week earlier, I might not have even cared. How sad is that? Now, after our time together, I wanted, no, needed to help her. 

 "Give me a few days to figure it out, Ok? We'll talk then, and I'll see what the best choices are." 

 "Can we even afford it?" she asked softly. 

 "Dad says yes. Heck, I'm probably going free wherever I choose. As long as you don't choose somewhere like SMU or Rice, we can probably swing it." 

 "You think so?" 

 "Pretty sure. We'll work it out, alright?" 

 She nodded, the tears she'd shed earlier all gone. That had surprised me. Tiffany was tough, rarely cried. "I gotta finish up some school work. See you later?" 

 She smiled. "You know it. We still have the big issue to deal with." 

 * * * * 

 The clock started striking, and I looked up from my laptop in anticipation. More news, I don't know how good it was. 

 The clock chimes were becoming Pavlovian. I felt myself hardening at the idea of my sister joining me. Sure enough, before it had finished striking, she was slipping in the door, closing it behind her. She had Mom's phone in hand again, and was undressing before the clock stopped. She looked up at me with a teasing grin, thumbs hooking in the sides of those teasing pink panties. Tugging at them, giving me a questioning look. 

 I shook my head and she pouted, crawling into the bed beside me. "News?" she asked, while her hand slipped under the covers, sliding up my thigh, coming to rest on my erection. She grinned mischievously. 

 "Plenty. Went through her other emails, text messages. Aunt Tina's trouble. She's encouraging Mom. Apparently she had her own little fling last year, and Mom knows about it. She's not the only one either. Mrs. Ellis is in on it." 

 Tiffany stroked me softly. "Shit. Are all these women crazy? I can't believe Uncle Tim would put up with Aunt Tina cheating. And Mrs. Ellis? It's hard to believe she even could cheat! I mean, seriously, who would want to, with her?" 

 I sighed, enjoying the stroking. "Not much new news, other than that," I said. "Text from the Fat Bastard, confirming Monday at 6:00. Wants to meet at the restaurant in the Marriott. That's not good." 

 She pushed my laptop out of the way, and pulled the covers aside, scooting down to get a better look at my cock as she stroked it. "That really sucks. What's your plan for stopping her on Monday?" 

 "No... plan," I said, getting distracted. 

 She hopped up and gave me a quick peck on the lips. Climbed across me, lying down and leaning over the edge of the bed. I couldn't resist fondling her cute butt cheeks, before she came up with the roll of paper towels. She unrolled a few sheets, folded them, and laid them across my belly. "Let's keep it neat." 

 She stroked my cock steadily, aimed up my body, and move upward, until we were face to face. "Wanna practice kissing?" she teased. 

 "W... While you're doin' that?" I gasped. 

 She nodded, and her lips descended on mine. She kissed me, and after a few seconds, bit my lips. "Pay attention, Bret! Kiss me back, and make it good, or I'm stopping." 

 She started up again, and I did my best to remember what we'd gone over before. It was kinda good, concentrating on kissing her, it distracted me a little from what her hand was doing. Not enough, and after a few minutes I was groaning in her mouth. 

 She pulled back, her lips a scant inch from mine. "Come for me, bro." 

 She got her wish, and I breathed again, as she folded up the paper towel, wiping the head of my cock clean, and crumpled it up, tossing it toward the garbage can by my desk. She grinned. "Not bad. You lasted pretty long, the kissing is better, and hardly any hassle cleaning up." 

 She rolled over and lay on top of me, her beautiful breasts pressing against my chest. "You really gonna help me with the college thing?" she asked softly, resting her head on my shoulder. 

 My hands were wandering rather freely, and found themselves in her panties, rubbing her butt. "You're my sis, Tiffany. Even when we were at our worst, you must know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you." 

 She sighed. "I know." Her lips pressed against my neck. "You know I feel the same, right? You may piss me off, but you're still my bro." 

 "It's gonna sound horrible, but I'm glad Mom started messin' around," I told her. 

 She giggled. "I was thinking the same thing. We still gotta stop her, but if she hadn't, we'd still be fighting, wouldn't we?" 

 "I imagine so." 

 "What do we do about her?" 

 I had been thinking about it. I rolled her over, lying on top of her. Moved down a little so I could play with her breasts. "I'm thinking three things," I said, squeezing her tits. 

 She pushed my hands away, gently. "Sometime I can't believe you're my brother. If you're gonna play with them, treat 'em right. Get me worked up a little, don't just go grabbin' and squeezin', numbnuts." 

 I cupped them in my hands, feeling their soft fullness. Gentler, rubbing my thumb across her nipples. She sighed. "Like your sister's titties, do ya?" 

 "They're perfect," I muttered, distracted from what we'd been talking about. 

 She pushed me off of her. "Come here, clueless. They're your first tits, aren't they?" 

 I nodded. "Pretty much everything's a first, Tiff." 

 Her look softened. She lay on her back, and tapped the bed beside her. "Here, on your side. You'll have free access. Touch and caress, but start easy for now. I guess some girls like it rougher, but I don't. Play with them but be gentle." 

 I did as she said, one arm underneath her head, cuddled in close, the other hand just grazing her skin, touching her all over. 

 "Better. Much better. Now tell me about the plan again. Three things..." 

 I leaned forward and kissed her cheek. "First, we convince Mom she's loved and appreciated. We have to figure out how to get Dad paying her more attention." 

 "Loved, check." 

 "Then we work on the guilt, happy family, the risk, divorce, all that scary stuff," I said. I saw her nipples were hardening. Pretty little things. 

 "Guilt, check." 

 "Finally we interfere with the troublemakers. Fat Bastard most of all, we gotta try to keep him from her. Stop Aunt Tina from encouraging her. Her and Mrs. Ellis." 

 "Interfere, check," she said softer, squirming a little under my touch. Her hand grabbed mine, and brought it back to her tit, after it started wandering along her belly. "I guess 'How?' is the real question." 

 "She doesn't see him on weekends. We'll have lots of time tomorrow and Sunday to start paying her attention. Still gotta figure out how to get Dad working on her," I said. My fingertips grabbed her nipple and tugged lightly, feeling the firmness. 

 "Mmm," she purred. "That's nice, Bret." She was quiet for a few seconds, and twisted her torso a little. I figured it was a hint to pay the other one attention, and I did. "What about interfering?" 

 "Still have to come up with a plan for Monday. I... I was thinking of something pretty radical, for the guilt." 

 "Scoot down a little, bro. Kiss my booby." 

 I pressed my lips to her firm flesh, shifting lower on the bed. Lots of little kisses. 

 "I wanna feel your tongue," she whispered. "How radical?" 

 I don't know how I was supposed to respond, licking and talking at the same time. I kissed her nipple. "Let Mr. Ellis now about his wife's infidelity." 

 "Wow. That would cause some serious trouble," Tiffany said. 

 "Let Mom see the risk, the danger. Also get Mrs. Ellis to stop telling her it's Ok, that there's no risk if she's careful." 

 My lips were hovering over her nipple, kissing, and tonguing it lightly. "Suck it," she whispered, huskily. 

 I did, softly, then a little more firmly. "How? How do we unmask her?" 

 "He's gotta have a work email. Most businesses use the same pattern, something like first initial, last name. I can figure it out, given a little time. Once I have it, I can forward some of the texts from his wife, hiding who they were sent to." 

 "She might blame Mom. What if she tells Dad?" 

 "Probably be trouble, but she hasn't really done anything. She doesn't talk about the things she's done in the texts. She could deny it. Like I said, trouble, but not that bad." 

 "Suck, bro. Less talking, more sucking." She turned a little, giving me access to both her tits. I shut up, and enjoyed them for quite a while. She eventually pushed me away. "We've got to shave you next time. That was like sandpaper there for a while." She pushed me onto my back. "Wait here." 

 She left, and returned shortly with the lotion. "Time for blast-off number two. I'm gonna try to make you come. Hold out as long as you can. We're shooting for 10 minutes." 

 She laid out her paper-towels, lathered up her hands and started playing with my cock. She didn't seem to mind when I started playing with her tits. She even giggled softly. "Takin' your chances, aren't you? Think that's gonna help you hold out longer?" 

 I realized it would have just the opposite effect, and leaned back, hands behind my head, and let her work. Tried to distract myself thinking of what to do. "I'm gonna upload a program on Mom's phone. It will let me monitor her GPS and see where she goes. It'll also forward her texts. I'll forward them to your phone, since I hardly ever check mine." 

 "Mmmhmm," she murmured, adding some more lotion and stroking. "God, you have a nice one, bro." 

 I watched her hands, and had to turn away before I got too worked up. Too exciting, seeing the way she was looking at my cock, stroking it. "Any ideas were you want to go to college?" 

 She shrugged. "Not really. I know a lot of people going to UT, A&M, Tech, UTD, and UNT." 

 "They're good schools, you know. All have their specialties. Not too hard to get into. I'm gonna need your transcripts." 

 "But I haven't taken the SAT, and my grades kinda suck." 

 "Entrance essay. Great essays make up for a lot. There's other things we can do. Don't sweat it, Tiff. I got this. I just need your info." 

 She stretched out, bringing her face in line with her hand. "You're doing great, bro. After the first couple of times, I never thought you'd last more than a couple of minutes. You gettin' bored with me?" 

 I chuckled. "Talk to me about schooling. If I think about what you're doing, it's all over." 

 She brought her face closer, until I could feel her breath. "This? A little handjob? If you can't survive a few minutes of this, how are you ever gonna make it through the next phase?" 

 "Tiff..." I moaned, her face so sexy, her teasing driving me crazy. 

 "Long enough. Come for me Bret. Now. I need it," she whispered, her hand moving faster. 

 I groaned, surrendering to her. I thrust against her hand with my hips, and erupted. The first blast cleared the top of the paper towel, making her chuckle. She continued jerking me off, milking me dry. When I was done she took her time cleaning me up with the paper towels. I got a nice little sister kiss, nothing crazy, and then she rolled over on her back, wriggling out of her panties. This time I didn't discourage her. 

 "Your turn, Bret. Let's see what you've got. Tease me, touch me, make me come for you." 

 Having free access to her body made my heart race. I explored her, caressing her, kissing her all over. Her hand brushed across my skin, through my hair, encouraging me. Her soft words did the same, letting me know what she liked. I stayed at her torso for several minutes, before moving lower. She opened her legs, making herself available to me, and I was lost.  

 

 

===

So damn sexy. The first pussy I'd seen, and the sight, the smell, the feel drove all reason out of my head. I touched her tentatively, wanting to see what her flesh felt like, opening her a little, tugging on the flaps of skin. 

 "Is... is it your first time, bro?" 

 "Seeing one? Yes." I confessed. 

 "What do you think? Talk to me," she said softly. 

 "Amazing. Beautiful. Sexy," I said, my fingertip piercing her softly, pulling downward, opening her a bit. 

 She giggled. "Now you know how I feel about your big thing." 

 "But you've seen others..." 

 "Not like yours. It's amazing. Big and beautiful. Sexy as hell." 

 Using both hands, I opened her wider, peering at the pink flesh within. An image passed through my mind, the pink of her panties hiding the sexy pink flesh inside. I leaned forward and was struck with her smell. It was almost like an ice-cream brain-freeze, less painful, almost as shocking. I breathed deeply. 

 "Kiss it?" she asked softly. "Please?" 

 I trailed a line of kisses up the inside of each thigh, until I was alternating kisses on each side of it. I kissed the soft folds on each side of her opening, letting the tip of my tongue draw across her skin after each one. I kissed in the middle, my lips meeting her naughty ones. 

 "Higher, kiss me higher." 

 A few more little kisses, slower, my tongue brushing her flesh, moving upward. 

 "Higher," she gasped softly. 

 At the top of her opening, I saw where the flesh folded and bulged. Bright pink on the inside. I pulled her skin outward, getting a good look, before bringing my lips down and kissing her tenderly, my tongue flirting with her skin, moving, brushing, teasing, in the way she'd been teaching me to kiss. 

 "There!" she moaned. "Kiss me there, bro!" 

 The feel of her response was exhilarating. I planted my lips on her flesh, firmly. Sucking and kissing, exploring and teasing, my tongue pushing around the little ball of flesh hidden at the top, making her gasp and squirm. 

 I may be clueless, but I'm not an idiot. I'd seen my share of porn. Read quite a bit. I knew it was her clittoris, knew the clinical names: her mons pubis, clittoral glans & hood, labia majora, labia minora, vagina, perineum. Hell, I was a teenage male; I'd studied the damn thing. 

 Trust me, the real thing was a whole lot better. 

 Her legs were shaking, the moaning more intense. I was afraid I was going to have to stop and gag her. Her thighs closed tightly around my head, and her hand grabbed me by the hair, and pulled me down. The strangest part of it was, it didn't hurt. I liked it. Liked what I could do to her. Make 'experienced' Tiff lose a little control. 

 Whatever I was doing, with the sucking and tongue teasing, must have been good for her. She slammed her hips up into my face, whimpering hard, her thighs trying to crush my head. When she finally relaxed, she was stroking my hair softly. I was still glued to the top of her pussy. 

 "Slow, easy," she whispered. "I'm tender." 

 I backed off, planting little kisses, my tongue brushing against her fleetingly. 

 "Jesus, Bret. You're a lot better at that. Not great yet. I'm going to enjoy training you up." 

 I wiped by moist face on the bedspread, gave her a last little kiss down there, and moved up the bed. She rolled over into my arms, kissing my face. 

 "What did you think? You like doing that?" she asked softly. 

 "Loved doing it for you," I confessed. 

 She grinned. "Just for me?" 

 I nodded. "Don't imagine it would be the same with anyone else. I mean, you're so pretty down there, smell so good. The way you reacted. Everything." 

 She kissed my chest. "Good answer bro. In case you didn't figure it out, I liked it a lot. I'm not freaking you out, am I? This is all kinda quick between us. I... I wasn't expecting it. Not by a long shot." 

 My hands caressed her soft body. "Yeah, it's weird. Never really thought of you in this way, until..." 

 She popped her head up, looking at me. "Until when?" 

 "The first night you came in here. You bent over to tuck the towel back at the bottom of the door. I saw your panties, the flash of pink, and realized you had a great butt. The whole thought of that almost freaked me out." 

 She pouted. "Not when I walked in on you stroking it?" 

 I felt awkward again. "Uh... I was actually kind of pissed then. Not thinking of you." 

 "I thought of you, after. A lot." 

 I gave her buns a squeeze. "That's 'cause you're a slut," I teased. 

 "And you're clueless," she reminded me. 

 "You're gonna fix that right?" 

 She smiled, and licked my chest. "Oh yeah. I'll fix that. Just like you're gonna fix the Mom thing, and my college future." 

 I chuckled. "Sounds like I'm getting the better part of the deal." 

 "You are. But you're my bro. My twin. I'll do anything for you." 

 "Except actually acknowledge my presence at school." 

 She blushed. "That's asking a lot. We'll see. Fix everything, and we'll see." 

 I made her leave Mom's phone, which I loaded the GPS tracker app on before replacing it in the parental unit's room. I couldn't help but notice they were sleeping about as far apart as they could, on the king mattress. Maybe the problem was bigger than we thought. 

 * * * * 

 I had scheduled my first CLEP for that Saturday. Didn't get home until about 3: 00, confident I'd earned a few more credits. When I got home, Dad was working in the garage. I saw he was pulling together his fishing gear. He'd stopped asking me to join him years ago. I wasn't into fishing. Maybe I should have tried it. I don't know. Seemed kind of late now. 

 Mom was doing her weekly ironing, and Tiffany was nowhere to be found. 

 "How'd the test go?" Mom asked, adjusting Dad's shirt on the ironing board. 

 "Good. Pretty sure I aced it. Where's Tiffany?" 

 Mom gave me an odd look. "Out with her friends. Surprised you would ask, you two don't seem to get along much anymore." 

 I tried to hide any evidence of guilt. "I, uh, wanted to talk about the college thing. If I'm gonna help her get into any schools, I'm gonna need a lot more info from her." 

 Mom smiled. "It's so good of you to help her. I want you to know that your Dad and I really appreciate that. You can use your new card for any of her applications. Let us know when it gets low, and we'll add to it." 

 I took the shirts she'd finished, and gave her a kiss on the neck as I passed by. I think I surprised her. "I'm gonna put these away for you. Anything else I can help with?" 

 "If you wouldn't mind doing some of the folding, I'd appreciate it." 

 I hung up the shirts, and folded the clothes beside her. We talked. It was good. I realized that for the last couple of years, I never really made time to talk to the family. I'd have to do something about that. 

 The second load was dry when I finished putting away the folded clothes. I pulled everything out, and when Tiffany's pink panties tumbled out, I found myself getting hard. Embarrassing. I did my best to hide it, keeping the clothing in front of me, and turning a little away from Mom. 

 "You don't have to do that," Mom said. "I know you have your studies to do." 

 "I don't mind. I'm caught up with everything." I turned toward her. "Dad's going fishing?" 

 She nodded. "Early tomorrow. Who knows, maybe he'll even catch a fish." Something in the way she said it made me feel that she wasn't very enthusiastic about the idea. I didn't stay on the subject. 

 I was carrying the last folded clothes to the rooms, when Tiffany arrived home. She took one look at my hands full of clothing, and smiled, glancing over at Mom, and gave me a wink. 

 "Hey, Mom," she said. "You think we could go dress-shopping tomorrow? I need something for the Christmas formal." 

 Mom looked stunned. I stopped my task, and watched. 

 "You want me to go with you?" Mom asked. 

 Tiffany grabbed the latest batch of ironed clothes. "Of course. You know more about dressing up than anybody. All the girls say so. They wish their Moms could dress half as sexy as you." 

 Mom blushed. "I... I don't really dress sexy. I just like to dress nice now and then," she said. 

 Tiffany wouldn't let it go. "Sexy, Mom. I'm 18 now, I need some of your clothes-smarts." 

 I think Mom was torn between embarrassment and pride. "Sure. That would be fun. After lunch?" 

 Tiffany nodded, giving Mom a kiss on the cheek. "Great. You're the best." 

 She walked my way, grinning, and gave me another wink. 

 I disappeared into my cave for a while, doing a little research, both on the schooling and on our little 'problem'. I was at it longer than I thought, and didn't come out until I was called down for dinner. 

 It was pretty typical for us, and I realized we didn't talk much at dinner. Tiffany did, but the rest of us were more sounding boards. I wondered when that had happened? 

 Dad told us he was going to bed early, he was getting up at 4:00 am. Tiffany and I insisted we'd take care of the leftovers and dishes, and that Mom should relax and watch TV. 

 "Plans, big bro?" my sister whispered at the sink. 

 "Nothing special. Hang out with Mom." 

 "Let's liquor her up," Tiffany said. 

 Didn't sound like a bad idea to me. Maybe we could get her to talk. I opened a bottle of wine, poured Mom a big class, and poured smaller ones for Tiff and me. I carried Mom's out to her. She looked up in surprise. 

 "What's this for?" she asked. 

 "Nothing special. You work hard all week, then do all the house chores on Saturday, you deserve to unwind a little. 

 By the second bottle, Mom was leaning against me while I massaged her shoulders. Her feet were in Tiffany's lap, getting a foot-rub. We could hear Dad's snoring from where we were. 

 "Mmmm," Mom purred. "I could get used to this." It looked like she was feeling no pain. 

 "Best Mom in the world," I said. I looked down at Tiffany and she pursed her lips in a kiss, and nodded toward Mom. I took the hint, leaned down and kissed Mom's cheek. 

 She giggled. She had finished almost a full bottle by herself, so it wasn't surprising. "Best kids," she answered, reaching up and patting my hand. 

 "Bret kissed a girl. I heard he might have gotten to second base," Tiffany teased. I could feel the blood rushing to my face. 

 "Bret?" She turned and looked up at me. "Who? You've got a girlfriend now?" 

 "Just a friend," I said. "Probably won't be many more kisses, she said I was lousy at it." 

 She giggled again. "My boy, a lousy kisser. I don't believe it." 

 "That's what she said," I replied, glaring at my sister. She stuck her tongue out at me. 

 "Why? How? What did you do wrong?" Mom asked. She rose up a little higher, her arm leaning on my thigh, twisting on the couch. 

 "I don't know. It's not like I ever kissed anyone before," I said. 

 "Never? Really?" Mom seemed surprised. 

 She looked back at Tiffany. "I imagine you've kissed a few boys." 

 Tiffany grinned. "A few. No complaints. We're not all clueless nerds." 

 Mom pouted. "You shouldn't tease your brother. With all he's gonna do for you, college and all." She took another big sip of her wine, finishing another glass. I was refilling it, when she continued badgering Tiffany. "You should show him how." 

 Her words shocked me to the core. That Mom would even contemplate that! 

 Tiffany answered in what I hoped was mock disgust. "Me? Kiss him? You've got to be kidding!" 

 Mom frowned. "I'm not kidding. Don't be selfish!" 

 Tiff rolled her eyes. "No way. He's my brother, for Christ's sake!" 

 Mom gasped. "Don't you swear in this house! What's wrong with you?" 

 This wasn't going well. Last thing I wanted was for Mom to be upset. I started rubbing her shoulders again. "It's no big deal, Mom. Really." 

 I finally got an inkling of Tiffany's intentions when she said, "You teach him, if it's no big deal." 

 Mom blushed. "But I'm his mother!" 

 "And I'm his sister. Who's the selfish one now, Mom? I'm sure you have a lot more experience at kissing than me." 

 "It's not the same, baby," she whined. "I gave up that kind of kissing years ago. I'm married now." 

 "You don't kiss Dad like you did when you guys were dating?" Tiffany asked. 

 Mom shook her head slowly. "Things change, after 20 years. You wouldn't understand." 

 "When's the last time you kissed anyone for real? Like you meant it?" Tiffany asked. 

 If anything, Mom blushed harder. She took a deep drink from her glass. "I told you, it's been a while with your father." 

 I was afraid my sister was going to push it. "I guess I'm not the only one who needs practice," I teased. 

 Mom grinned, and I could see her eyes were a little unfocused. I think the wine was doing its part. "Me? Practice? I'll have you know, I'm a very good kisser. Very, very good." 

 Tiffany was pushing again. "Why do I think that's your ego talking, Mom? Maybe you thought you were good once." 

 Mom frowned. "You don't think I know how to kiss?" 

 Tiff shrugged her shoulders. "Not for real. Not the way I do." 

 Mom struggled to sit up. "You're wrong. I'm not good, I'm the best! Everyone says so." 

 "Who's everyone, Mom?" Tiffany teased. 

 Mom took another drink. "You know what I mean. Back then." 

 "In the stone ages? You don't use it, you lose it," Tiffany said. 

 "You think so? Why don't we let Bret decide, or are you too afraid?" Mom snapped. 

 "I will if you will," was my sister's answer, said with a mocking grin. 

 Mom sat straighter, brushed her hair back. "Alright, Bret. Looks like it's your lucky night." 

 I was leaning back against the couch arm, and she turned and climbed up on top of me. "Pretend I'm your new girlfriend. Don't do anything at first, just let me kiss you. When you have a feel for it, you can do a little of what I do." She looked over at my sister. "Not too much, understand. I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself." 

 She placed her face in front of mine, and whispered, "We'll start slow. Work up to a good one, Ok? Don't think about it, just go with the flow. Now close your eyes." 

 She started by brushing her lips across mine. Little light kisses around my face, stopping by my lips every now and then. The pauses at my mouth were getting longer, and I felt the tip of her tongue brush my upper lip. I could taste the wine on her breath, and my hands moved down to hold her. 

 She wiggled against me, getting comfortable, and her lips settled on mine, sucking, dragging her teeth across my lip, her tongue tracing the outline, before sliding between them. Her lips were soft and moist. Little fleeting touches of her lips, pressing against my teeth, parting them. I opened my mouth for her, and her tongue lashed in, brushing mine. My hands seemed to have a mind of their own, sliding down the small of her back resting on her bottom. 

 Her tongue retreated, and she whispered, "Kiss me, baby boy." 

 I tried some of what she'd done, the little flickering of the tongue, the exploration. She backed off a hair. "Lighter touch, to start. Tease me, make me want more. Like this." Her lips descended on mine, and her tongue was a devilish thing, teasing, taunting, tracing my teeth, sliding across my tongue fleetingly. When it retreated I did much of the same. She was a little low, and I had to bend over a little to kiss her. I grabbed her butt cheeks, and pulled her up my body a couple of inches, feeling her breasts against my chest. 

 She was between my legs, and moaned a little as I moved her. Her tongue started teasing mine, then wrestled with it a little. As I pulled it back, she followed, giving chase, her warm wet tongue filling my mouth. I echoed her moan. Before I knew it, our heads had shifted, our mouths at an angle, and my tongue was in her mouth, exploring, learning. I tried to see how far back I could reach, and she pulled back. "Not that," she whispered. "Not yet. Don't do in more than about half-way." 

 Her lips met mine, and I drifted away, my whole world my mother's mouth, our kiss intense, passionate. She changed, her lips drawing back, her tongue still teasing me. Mine pursued her, and hers drew circles around mine, sucking on it, dragging her teeth along the bottom. She was nibbling my lips, kissing my face, opening my mouth and dominating me, before retreating shyly, inviting me to do the same. Her hands were in my hair, her fingers running through it, her body twisting sensuously. 

 I was hard as a rock, and could feel her body pressed against my erection, pushing and retreating. I had one arm behind her, holding her from escaping, the other playing with her bottom. Her movements slowed, her tongue retracting, only making teasing caresses. A final shower of little kisses ended with a closed mouth kiss that was almost as intense as the best of it. Her hand caressed my cheek, softly. She pulled away, and I opened my eyes. She was smirking. "Can Momma kiss, or what?" 

 "Wow," I gasped. 

 She gave me a quick peck, and grinned. "You're not a bad kisser, Bret. I think you just need some guidance and practice." 

 "Damn, Mom. That was hot!" Tiffany said from right beside us. I had no idea she had moved that close. She was kneeling beside the couch, her face only a few inches from ours. "Are you sure you haven't been practicing?" 

 Mom blushed. "Still think your old mother doesn't know what she's doing? Let's see you match that, ornery thing." 

 She climbed off of me, and I'm sure it was an accident when Mom's hand brushed across my erection. 

 Tiffany poked me. "Sit up, bro." 

 I did, facing her, and she climbed in my lap, straddling me. "Let's see if the old lady taught you anything." 

 Mom huffed, "Old lady, my ass." She sipped her wine, watching us. 

 Tiffany and I went through kissing 101, and moved straight to kissing 410, senior level work. After a few minutes, I started responding to her the way Mom had kissed me. I felt her melting into my arms, letting me kiss her, grinding her crotch against me. I held her head, kissing her with the passion Mom had shown me, conquering her mouth, making claim to it, finishing with the flurry I'd learned only minutes earlier. 

 She pulled away, and I saw surprise in her eyes. "Wow," she said. 

 Mom laughed. "Still think I don't know what I'm doing?" 

 Tiffany shook her head. "Teach him some more. I gotta learn this stuff." 

 Mom gave Tiffany a nudge, and took her place on my lap. "There's so much more, baby boy. Slow and easy, passionate, teasing. So many ways to show your lover how you feel. This time, we're gonna go for something a little different." 

 Little different meant starting gentle, then moving to a deep kiss, her tongue barely moving, exploring at a snail's pace, running along every groove in my teeth, learning the entire layout of my mouth. 

 The kissing was only half of it. Her hands moved almost as slowly, touching me, caressing my shoulders, my chest, down my sides, my arms, my neck. She drew away. "The touching, Bret. Touch me like I'm touching you, slow, easy, gentle. It's part of it." 

 My hands explored Mom's back, her sides, down to her bottom and back up again. I was nervous when I brought them up her sides, under her arms, moving forward, feeling the swell of her breasts, tracing their outline, brushing across her nipples. 

 "Fingertips," she whispered, slipping her mouth away for a moment, kissing my jaw-line, licking my neck. 

 I touched her lightly, tracing the edge of her bra, moving up to her neck, then sliding down her cleavage against her bare skin. I could feel her crotch gliding up and down my length, her hips hunching then grinding. "Mmmm, Momma's big boy," she purred while my lips and tongue matched her earlier movements, along her neck and up to her ear. My fingers struggled with her top button, finally succeeding and moving to the next. 

 "Patience," she purred, her eyes closed, her head tilted to give me access to her neck. "Slowly, one button at a time. Caress, touch, explore, unbutton."  

 

 

===

I have no idea how long we were at it. She was sitting in my lap, her shirt gone, her bra undone, my hands inside the loose holder, cupping her breasts, gently teasing her nipples. Her hips were making small circles, grinding against my aching cock. She was driving me crazy. I reached down, grabbed her bottom, and pulled her against me, humping against her. Her mouth descended on mine with a renewed passion, and she whimpered softly, moaning into my lips. I could feel her legs trembling, and her mouth went slack. She groaned, her hips twitching manically, rubbing against my shaft. I grunted, squeezing her ass fiercely, as I made a mess in my pants. She tore her lips off mine, lowered her head to my shoulder, biting down and stifling a scream. 

 I held her softly, waiting for her teeth to release me. She kissed my shoulder, my neck, my cheek, my lips. She gave me a naughty little smile. "Now that's how you kiss." 

 I pulled her head forward, kissing her lips. "I love you, Mom," I said. 

 She grinned, and gave me a quick peck on the lips. "I know, baby." 

 She climbed off of me, and leaned back on the couch, breathing deep and slow. "I think that's the end of kissing lessons for the night." 

 Tiffany moved over and cuddled up to Mom, sandwiching her between us. "How come you don't kiss Dad like that anymore?" 

 Mom's smile disappeared. "I... I don't think he wants me to. Not for a while now. We... don't do much of anything." She leaned into me, and I could feel her tears against my skin. She was shaking. "I think he doesn't want me anymore." 

 "Impossible," I said. I hugged her close, trying to brush away her tears. 

 "Four months," she whined. "Four months since... since..." 

 Tiffany was hugging her from behind. "Since you made love?" 

 Mom nodded. "I dress up for him, try to look my best. I bought some special outfits. He won't hardly touch me." She was crying hard, and I lifted her and pulled her into my lap. I held her close, trying to ignore the fact that her bra had slid up her chest, and her tits were right in front of me, bare. 

 Tiffany moved closer, rubbing Mom's legs soothingly. She reached up and fixed her bra, still lose, but covering her. 

 That seemed to wake Mom up. She sat upright, reaching behind her and re-closing her bra strap. She shook her hair back, and sighed. "I... I think we got a little carried away," she said calmly. She gave me a sad little smile. "I don't think your new girl will think you're a lousy kisser anymore." 

 I leaned over and kissed her softly. "Thanks, Mom. I'm sorry if I got a bit out of control. I... I didn't know, that was amazing." 

 Her smile grew a little. "I'm glad someone thinks so." She reached down for her shirt, then rubbed her hand slowly down my chest. "You're all grown up now, aren't you?" 

 "Gettin' there," I confessed. 

 Mom nodded. "Don't teach your sister everything we just did. She is your sister, after all." 

 "Mo-om," Tiffany whined. 

 Mom grinned, leaned over and gave Tiff a peck on the lips. "I think I should go to bed now, before things get any crazier. You two be good." I got a nice little lip-lock before she left, and walked unsteadily away. 

 Tiffany watched her go, then turned to me. "I guess that changes everything," she said. 

 I nodded. 

 She glanced down at the huge wet spot on my crotch. "You need to clean up." She looked over at the clock. "I'll see you in about an hour," she whispered. 

 I hit the bathroom, taking off my pants and soiled underwear and dumping them in the dirty laundry. I noticed a pink lotion on the sink, and it reminded me of Tiff's panties. I started to get hard, while I wiped myself clean. A hell of an evening. 

 * * * * 

 Dad's computer was more of a challenge. Cracking into the computer wasn't that bad. Getting the password to his email was. His mail was stored on the company computer, using IMAP. I finally found a free tool to crack the password, and then I was in. 

 He was also better about hiding his tracks. It took me a while of going through his temp files to get a feel for what he was doing and where he was going. He had a Gmail email account, and I took a flier and used my Web-browser Password Viewer. Hit the jackpot with every password that Chrome of Internet explorer had ever saved. It hadn't saved his Gmail one, but Dad had a bad habit. His passwords were all very similar, using a core password, with an ending customized for each site. Adding 'gm' to the end of his core password had me in. 

 I didn't worry about going through it then. Since it was cloud based, I could access it from anywhere. Satisfied that I had his info, I hid my tracks, shut everything down, and returned to my room. 

 I'd only been there for about 15 minutes, when the sweetest sound in the world started. 

 Halfway through the announcement of midnight, Tiffany slipped into the room. She was bare handed. 

 "Mom's phone?" 

 "Wasn't on the charger. I couldn't find it," Tiffany explained, peeling her top off and climbing into bed beside me, naked except for - you got it - little pink panties. 

 I was typing away on the laptop, setting up an IMAP email account from Dad's settings. Tiff cuddled up to me. "Whatcha doing?" She said it in her baby sister voice. Almost irresistible. 

 "Snaggin' Dad's work and personal emails." 

 She slid her hand inside the back of my shirt, wriggling closer. "How long before you've got it?" 

 "Already have both. Just making it so I can read them from my computer, without leaving too much of a trace." 

 She giggled, nibbling on my shoulder. "You're really good at this stuff, aren't you? How long did it take you?" 

 "Less than an hour. It's not that difficult." 

 "Maybe not for you, big brainy bro." 

 Her lips were at my neck, teasing me. "Tiff..." 

 "Put it aside, Bret. We need to talk about tonight, don't you think?" 

 "Talk?" 

 "To start." She reached forward and closed the lid of my laptop. With a sigh I put it to the side. Just in time, before she climbed on top of me, pushing me back on the bed. 

 "Tiffany..." I warned. 

 "God, that was hot. Watching you and Mom go at it. You know she got off, rubbing against you." 

 I nodded, my lips otherwise occupied a few seconds later. 

 "You think Dad's seeing someone else?" she asked, when we came up for a breather. 

 "I would have thought it was impossible, but then I thought the same about Mom. I just don't know. That's why I'm investigating." 

 "Was kissing Mom really that good?" she asked, nibbling my ear. 

 "Pretty incredible." 

 "Better than me?" she pouted. 

 "C'mon, Tiff. You remember our last kiss out there. I got to you. I know I did. That was what Mom taught me, with just two sessions." 

 "Shit. I had to change panties, I was leaking so bad," Tiffany confessed. "What the hell is Dad thinking?" 

 "Listen, we don't know anything about Dad yet. We do know Mom's been messing around, and her damn friends are encouraging her. Face it. She's primed. All it took was a little wine and cuddling, and she was going crazy on me." 

 "So Mom's plan stays the same?" 

 "I think so. Give her the attention she needs, make her feel guilty if she looks like she's gonna stray. Interfere with the Fat Bastard." 

 "She felt you up, didn't she?" Tiffany teased. 

 "I think it was an accident," I said. What Tiff's hand was doing down below was no accident. 

 "Bullshit, Bret. You can't be that ignorant. Mom got a good feel in." 

 "She was drunk, and worked up," I said, for some reason feeling like I had to defend her. 

 "I think I'm gonna try to work on Dad. Get the scoop from the horse's mouth." She turned a little giving me better access to her tit. Smaller than Mom's, but not by a lot. Perkier. 

 "Think he'll tell you?" 

 "I'm still Daddy's little girl. He can't resist me," she giggled. "Hell, I may even get up and go fishing with him." 

 "At 4:00 am?" 

 Her hand was clutching my hard-on, stroking me. "Alright. Let's forget that. I'll get him afterward, before Mom and I go shopping." 

 I nodded. "I'll work on Mom a little more, and go through Dad's email. He has a friggin' ton." 

 "Sounds like a plan. So you ready for another lesson on the fine art of kissin' the kitty?" 

 I pulled her lips down and kissed her. A good one, long and intimate, the way Mom had started to teach me. She settled into my arms, and let me take control. 

 When we pulled apart, she gazed into my eyes. "Damn, bro! What happened to the klutzy kisser of a few nights ago?" 

 "You always said I was a quick learner." 

 "Shit. You keep this up, and... and... hell, I don't know what. You're already about the best I've kissed. Jesus, bro!" 

 "Relax, Tiff, I think it's time for me play with the pink within the pink." 

 "Play away bro. I'll never stop you." 

 "You better, or Mom and Dad will find me parked under the dinner table, my head between your thighs." 

 She giggled. "You really like doing that? For real?" 

 "I love it. Here, let me show you." 

 I did, for an eternity, until I heard the singular  of the clock striking one. I got her off a few times, and was feeling pretty proud. She pushed me off of her, with a mischievous grin. "My turn, big bro." 

 She moved between my legs, stroking my cock, and I almost died when she licked it. "God, Tiff," I groaned. 

 She chuckled, "I thought you'd like that." She pressed her lips against my shaft, looking up at me. "I... I don't have a lot of practice doing this. It's only my second time, and the first lasted all of 5 seconds, before the idiot ruined my sweater." 

 I smiled for her, brushing her hair back. "Hell, Sis. It's my first. It's gonna be the best no matter what. Especially since it's you." 

 "You want me to suck your big fat cock, don't you?" 

 "More than anything." 

 She gave me a teasing grin. "More than anything?" 

 "Right now, I'd say yes. You're driving me crazy." 

 Hell, I don't know if there's good BJs or bad ones. I do know, it was incredible. Mind blowing. Watching her, seeing her pretty face, mouth surrounding my shaft, loving eyes looking up at me. I can proudly say, I lasted more than 5 seconds. Almost five minutes. "Tiff," I groaned. 

 She pulled away, stroking me hard, and watched me come. "Damn, that's cool," she whispered. She cleaned me up, and in the doing so, had me semi-hard again. Her mouth engulfed me, and I groaned. "Shh!" 

 "Sorry," I moaned. 

 I did a lot better the second time. It wasn't like the stuff I saw on videos. Most of the time her sexy hot mouth bobbed up and down on the end, her hand stroking me. It felt incredible. She pull away, kissing and licking, playing with me for a while, before going back to the sucking and stroking. I was getting close, when she backed off. "You think Mom is as good at this as she is at kissing?" my rotten sister asked. 

 "Tiff... please," I gasped. 

 She grinned, and went back at it. I groaned a few seconds later, and she pulled away, letting me finish. When I was done spurting, she was staring at the messy end of my cock. She leaned forward and licked it, and I felt like she'd driven a spike right down to my balls. Fucking intense. 

 I watched in waitful agony, as she got a distracted look. She went back for more, taking the head of my cock in her mouth. She sucked away. "Easy," I pleaded. "It hurts a little." 

 She was gentler, her tongue playing a bit. She pulled away. "Kinda slimy. Nasty. I can see why the girls don't like that in their mouths." 

 I was a little hurt. I don't know why. I should have been on cloud nine. She must have seen something in my face. "Oh, baby. You want me to do it, don't you? Take that nasty stuff in my mouth." 

 I shrugged, trying to play it cool. "Nah, that was great." 

 She had her washcloth out cleaning me. She put it to the side and cuddled into me. "Be honest, Bret. Things are just getting good between us. Let's make a deal. We'll never lie to each other. Not you and me. Ok?" 

 I nodded. 

 "You want to come in my mouth don't you?" 

 Sheepishly, I nodded again. 

 "Why?" 

 Why? I didn't know why. I just knew the idea was beyond exciting. "I... I don't know. Thinking about it drives me crazy." 

 She smiled, her lips brushing mine. "I'll think about it, Ok? You save our asses, get me in school, and I'll be real appreciative, I promise." 

 I squeezed her buns. "Definitely an ass worth saving." 

 She giggled. "Did you like my present?" 

 "Amazing, Tiff. God, I didn't think anything could feel that good." 

 She sighed, resting in my arms. "I love you," she whispered. 

 "Love you too." 

 When I woke she was gone, but I was clutching her panties, next to my face. 

 * * * * 

 Sunday I didn't leave my room much. Too much to do. Go through Dad's seemingly endless email. Check through Mom's, just in case. Research the Ellis email. I had some success there. Googling his company's domain and checking their website, it looked like they were pretty consistent. First initial, first six letters of the last name. I did a command line telnet smtp login to the email server.

 Crap. 550. Bad address. I thought about that. Warren Ellis. I know that's his name. I did a quick search, checked in LinkedIn, using Dad's account, and got my answer. Michael Warren Ellis. He went by his middle name, God only knows why.

 221 2.0.0. Bye 

 I felt a little bad doing it, but I pulled up an anonymous emailer, created an email for Mr. Ellis, and built up a 'best-of' cheaters email compilation, with a series of sanitized snatches of Mrs. Ellis' comments about her past lover, and the fact that she'd never get caught. I tried to make it as generic as possible, so that Mr. Ellis would get the drift, without pointing the source directly at Mom. 

 I had a feeling that Mrs. Ellis would be too busy to be encouraging Mom to cheat for a while. 

 Mom stuck her head in my door, and I closed the open window on my monitor. Don't know why, Mom would have no idea what I was up to. 

 "Joining us for lunch?" 

 She looked pretty normal. Not much evidence of what we'd been up to the night before. 

 "Sure. I'll be down in a minute." 

 "Good. See you in a bit." She gave me a natural smile, and a little bit of the nervousness that I'd been harboring dissipated. 

 Turns out, 'us' was me and Mom. Tiffany hadn't gotten back from whatever she was up to, and Dad's fishing excursion must have been dragging. It was 1:30 and he still wasn't back. Mom was in the kitchen, and I walked up behind her, brazen, and put my arms around her waist. "What's for lunch?" 

 "Behave, Bret," she said, but didn't try to escape, and giggled when I pressed against her rear, and kissed her neck. "It's just sandwiches. Plain chips, or barbecue?" 

 I was still hugging her, and her butt was wiggling against me. Just a little, but enough to see she wasn't mad or anything. "Barbecue." 

 The sandwiches were ready, two plates sitting on the counter. She wrapped her arms around mine. "You're in a good mood, aren't you?" 

 "Why shouldn't I be? Three of the schools I'm looking at have guaranteed a free ride. UTD will even pay me to go, $4,000 per semester to defray costs and a $2,000 cash scholarship for international study." 

 Mom twisted in my arms, excited. "Really? Everything paid?" 

 "Everything, plus $8,000 a year for expenses." 

 She hugged me around the neck. "Oh, baby, I'm so proud of you. I knew you could do it!" 

 I couldn't resist and leaned down and kissed her. On the lips. She responded and we held it for at least a minute or two. When I released her she was blushing. She came me a teasing smack on the shoulder. "Behave, baby boy." 

 I stole another peck, before grabbing our plates. "Just a little practice Mom. I don't want anyone to tell me I'm a lousy kisser again." 

 She smacked my rear, before following with the drinks. "I wouldn't worry about that anymore." 

 We talked about the scholarships. I explained that of the local schools, SMU only offered $5K automatically, leaving about $35K in expenses. UNT was almost as good a deal at UT Dallas, with tuition, book, fees and room and board covered, plus $500 a semester for expenses. 

 TCU wasn't nearly as good. University of Dallas was another full ride, but I had no interest. UT Dallas was one of the top engineering schools in the state, and had been in my top 5 list for years. 

 "Now where is that one again?" Mom asked. 

 "Richardson. Only about 15 minutes away." 

 "But is it a good school? You deserve the best, after all the work you've done." 

 "Only Rice and UT Austin have better ranked programs in Texas," I explained. "And Rice only pays about a grand for NMF." 

 "But what about MIT? Cal Tech? The other places you were talking about." 

 "I'm still looking into them. But I've always liked UTD and it's kind of cool to make money while attending." 

 "Any progress helping Tiffany?" 

 "Not yet, but I'm working on it." 

 When we'd finished eating, I got up. "Let me do the dishes, Mom. Relax a bit. You're always running around." 

 "But your studies..." 

 "If I choose UTD, I'm done. I'm in. All I'd need to do is graduate." 

 "What about Valedictorian?" she whined. 

 "Still working on it. I haven't said UTD was the one. If I get in at MIT or Cal Tech, I'll need every advantage I can get, to help defray the costs. I'll still be Valedictorian, Mom. Just no more cramming for standardized tests, or worrying about CLEPs and such. I can concentrate just on my classes, and next semester, they're pretty damn easy. I've maxed out on the advanced and AP classes except for Math and Econ." 

 With plates in my hands, I leaned over and snuck in a quick kiss on the lips. "I got this Mom. Trust me. You take a break." 

 When Tiffany got home half-an-hour later, Mom was leaning back on the couch, her legs in my lap, as I massaged her feet and calves. She started to sit up, and I pushed her shoulders back down. "Relax." 

 She didn't argue settling back down. Tiffany came over grinning. "Someone's spoiled," she teased. 

 Mom grinned, her eyes still closed. "I'm not complaining." 

 Tiff pulled the pillows off the back of the couch. Then she sat next to Mom. "Move in. I'm getting me some of this." 

 Mom scooted over, her feet shifting closer to my body, her calf resting on my newly growing erection. Mom rubbed her leg against it. "Behave, Bret," she teased. 

 Tiffany lay down next to her, plopping her feet on my lap. "Shoes, Tiff?" 

 "Take em off, lazybones." 

 I sighed and removed her sneakers and half socks. I alternated rubbing their feet. Mom turned slightly making a little more room for Tiffany, holding my sister in her arms. "I've got the best kids in the world," she said. 

 "Best family," Tiffany reminded her. 

 We were quiet, enjoying the moment. "Your brother has three full rides already," she said softly. 

 "Really? Where?" Tiffany asked. 

 "UTD's the only one that really matters. If I don't get close to a full scholarship with any of my top 3 choices, I'll probably go there," I explained. 

 She sat up after a bit, and came to stand next to me. "Switch, bro. I think you deserve a little spoiling. You get a free ride, maybe we can afford for me to go." 

 She gave me a teasing look, glancing at the space next to Mom. I know what she wanted. 

 I got up, and Mom pouted for a bit, until Tiffany was rubbing her feet again, and I was trying to fit in the space she left vacant. It was a tight squeeze, and I pulled Mom into my arms, squeezing up against her. I was only wearing a t-shirt and shorts, so I didn't have to worry about shoes or anything.  

 

 

===

Mom sighed, snuggling against me. "This is nice," she murmured. 

 I scooted down and kissed her. "Bret..." 

 "Practice, Mom." I whispered, then lost myself in her lips again. She wasn't drunk this time. No excuses. She let me kiss her at first, and then started kissing me back. It made a big difference. 

 "God, Mom! You're the best kisser in the world," I told her, holding her close. 

 She giggled. "Now how would you know that? Have you kissed everyone else?" 

 "No, I just can't imagine it getting any better." 

 She chuckled. "Silly boy. Trust me, it gets even better." 

 Our lips met, and Mom leaned on top of me, her body writhing, her hands exploring my body. She was right. Hard to believe but it was even better. I felt Tiffany moving, scooting closer, her legs pressed against the back of my thighs, lifting my legs. Mom moaned sweetly. "Tiffany..." she murmured. 

 "Keep training him Mom. He needs it." 

 I looked down and her hands were wandering over Mom's body. The couch was too crowded. I slid off the end, dragging Mom with me. I pulled her on top of my body. Moments later Tiffany was beside us, kissing my shoulder. My hands ran into hers as I caressed Mom. 

 Mom lips broke free. "I... I think that's enough lessons for the day," she said. 

 I didn't. I pulled her back in for a kiss, and she sighed sweetly. 

 I turned with her, putting her on her side, sandwiching her between Tiffany and me. "Do you have any idea how much we love you, Mom? You're the best Mom in the world." I told her. 

 Tiffany's arms were around her, her lips pressed to Mom's neck, her face only inches from mine. "Best Mom in the galaxy," she said. 

 "Best Mom in the universe," I argued, pulling her closer, her leg between mine, the top of her thigh rubbing my crotch teasingly. 

 Tiffany had other ideas. She pulled our Mom's shoulders downward, rolling her onto her back, sliding her leg over Mom's, leaning over her. I matched her position on the other side. I groaned when Tiffany leaned down and kissed Mom. "Teach me too, Mom. I wanna be able to kiss like you." 

 Mom trembled. "Baby girl..." Her words were cut off, as Tiffany lips took over. Mom pushed her away a little. "Start slow, baby. Like I showed your brother. Take your time. We're not going anywhere." 

 I had my hand inside Mom's shirt, rubbing her belly, slowly working my way upward. When Tiffany backed off, I took her place, turning Mom's face toward me, and kissing her with all I'd learned. Her kisses were soft and loving, intimate, hot. Tiffany gave me a nudge, and I gave Mom up. Mom was grinning, her eyes closed. "So different, my two babies. So sweet." 

 I had Mom's breast by now, cupping and squeezing gently. She whimpered slightly, the sound muffled by my sister's mouth. I tried to get my hand in her bra, but it was uncomfortable. When Tiffany backed off, I pulled Mom toward me, kissing her deeply. I stopped for a second, looking at Tiffany. She screwed up her forehead in question. "Bra," I mouthed. She grinned and gave me a wink. 

 Mom was nuzzling into my neck, sucking softly. I thought I was going to get my first hickey. When she pulled away, I rolled her onto her back, passing her off to my sister. My hand went back inside her shirt, under her slack bra, and onto her breast. She moaned for me. 

 Back and forth we passed Mom, kissing her, teasing her, fondling her. I was taking her back into my arms, when Tiffany sat up, and grabbed the bottom of Mom's shirt. "Arms up, Mom," I whispered. Moments later she was topless, shirt and bra gone, Tiffany was the same before I got done kissing Mom, and passed her back. I removed my shirt, then scooted down and kissed Mom's breast. 

 She moaned, her hand reaching down and stroking my hair. I was sucking on her nipple, when Tiffany joined me on the other. She gave me a wink, then cuddled in. 

 "My... babies," Mom murmured, her hands caressing both of us. "My sweet, sweet, babies." 

 I could have stayed there forever, but the sound of the garage door retracting stopped us. I sat up, and grabbed Mom's shirt. "Arms up, Mom." 

 She smiled at me, as I pulled her shirt down. I folded up her bra and put it in my pocket. Tiffany was standing, and already had her bra back on, and was putting on her shirt. We heard the garage door lowering, as I lifted Mom to her feet, giving her a hug. 

 Tiffany took her from me, hugging her tightly. "Ready to go shopping?" she teased. 

 Mom grinned. "I... I've got to say hi to your father, see how he did. I really should change before shopping." She looked at me with a little smirk. "Seems like I lost my bra somewhere. You two are bad, you know?" 

 "Bad? Because we love our Mom?" I asked. 

 "Alright, not bad. But more than a little naughty." 

 I had my shirt on, and Tiffany was headed back to her room when Dad entered through the side kitchen door. 

 Mom hurried off toward him. "How'd it go?" she asked. 

 Dad was all grins. "Three good sized bass. I know what we're having for dinner." 

 Mom gave him a hug, then wrinkled her nose. "Someone needs a shower." She looked up at him. "Like some help?" 

 Dad grinned, glancing at me. "Really?" 

 She nodded. "I gotta get ready too. Taking your Princess out shopping. We could save some water." 

 Dad looked surprised, and happy. I wondered what the issue was that Mom had talked about. Him not touching her. He sure seemed willing. Mom looked over at me. "Can you clean the fish, Bret?" 

 Dad shook his head. "Just put them on ice. I'm not sure how I'm going to cook them." 

 "Got it. You kids have fun," I teased, getting an embarrassed look from Dad, and a mischievous one from Mom. 

 They walked past me, hand-in-hand, and again I wondered, what could their problem be. 

 "Ask Bret about his college choices," I heard Mom say, before they disappeared behind the door of their bedroom. 

 I had cleaned out the cooler, put fresh ice on the bottom, and the fish on top, under some more ice. I was washing my hands, when I felt hands around my waist. "Naughty bro," she teased. "Making out with your Mom. Where is she?" 

 I turned and pulled her close, stealing a kiss. "She and Dad are showering together. I think she might be a while." 

 "Really? But what about..." 

 "Beats me. Mom offered, and Dad seemed to like the idea. I gotta admit, I'm really confused." 

 Tiffany nodded. "Me too. I'll try to talk to her while we're out shopping. Get anything done today?" 

 "A little. I hacked Mr. Ellis' business email and sent him an anonymous message about his wife's activities." 

 "Wow. You really did it?" 

 I nodded. 

 Tiffany looked thoughtful. "Alright, I think Mom knows she's loved and appreciated, but I think we should keep it up. We went pretty far today, I don't think we should push it much further." 

 "At least she was sober, and didn't seemed upset afterward." 

 Tiff agreed. "The Ellis email should work toward the guilt thing. Soon as she finds out at least. What about Aunt Tina?" 

 "Not now. Give it some time. We don't want it to all happen the same day. That would be suspicious. We can still keep reminding Mom how important having an intact family is." 

 "And the interfering?" 

 "No plan yet for Monday. I'll think of something tonight." 

 Tiffany hugged me. "I know you will. You're the best, you know that?" 

 "Second only to my hot big sis," I teased. 

 She shook her head. "No. You're doing everything, it's like I'm a spectator." 

 I gave her a squeeze. "Hardly. Hell, I wouldn't even know anything was up if not for you. We make a good team." 

 She grinned. "We do don't we?" 

 "The best." 

 I got a kiss for that. I think we were both getting better. Thanks Mom. 

 * * * * 

 Dad's emails yielded nothing. If he was cheating, there was no evidence. Nothing even close. It was like he didn't even know any women. Getting curiouser and curiouser. 

 I did go down and chat with him a bit. Told him the scholarship news, and who was offering the most to National Merit Scholarship Finalists. He quizzed me about my choices, and seemed satisfied with my answers. "You really think you can help your sister get in somewhere?" 

 "I do. Got a few ideas in mind," I admitted. 

 It was getting late, and the girls weren't back from their shopping. I guess they had left pretty late. It was a good hour after Mom went in for her shared shower, before she reappeared. 

 Dad had cleaned the fish and was getting ready to broil them. Not my favorite, but my appearance got me recruited to peel and slice potatoes. He was gonna do some kind of scalloped potato dish, to go with the fish. Great. Another not-so- favorite of mine. 

 Mom and Tiffany showed up barely in time. They were chatting and giggling like school girls. It made me feel good. Maybe our plan was working. 

 Dinner went over well, and Mom and Dad were better together than I could remember them in months. Sad that I hadn't noticed the issues until confronted with them. Now, looking back, I could remember the gap between them. 

 After dinner, Dad begged off, saying he was exhausted from getting up at the crack of dawn, and his afternoon exercise. He grinned at Mom as he said it, and she blushed. Cute. I was recruited to do the dishes, which was miserable. The pans were a bitch to deal with. Fortunately I was rewarded for my efforts. 

 Tiff insisted that I take a seat on the couch, and I was subjected to a fashion show. The girls had gone a little wild, upgrading Tiffany's wardrobe, and picking up a few new things for Mom. I know it should have been miserably boring, but I enjoyed it, both women showing off for me, posing. None of the outfits were really out of line, but it was obvious that Tiffany's were tighter and more revealing than usual. When she appeared in her formal dress, I'm sure my chin hit the floor. 

 Mom had finished showing off her stuff, and had taken a seat on the couch beside me. "Well? Nothing to say Bret? You don't like it?" 

 Tiff looked a little upset, the longer I took to reply. 

 "No. I like it. Love it. God, Tiff, you're beautiful!" 

 Her beginning pout became a full-fledged, cheek stretching smile. "Really? You're not just saying that?" 

 "No way. You... you're stunning. It looks amazing on you." 

 That got me a hug and quick kiss. "Thanks. That's sweet," she said. 

 She recruited Mom to help her put everything away. "Wine," she whispered in my ear. 

 When they came back a little later, I had the TV on, relaxing and the wine glasses out. Mom looked at them and hesitated. 

 "Gotta finish the dinner wine," I explained. That was what was in her glass. I'd had to open a new bottle for Tiff and I to have any. 

 I pulled her feet into my lap, and she started to push me away. "Oh no you don't buster. I know where the foot rubs end up. You two need to behave yourselves!" At least she was laughing when she said it. 

 "Just a foot-rub, for the best Mom in the world. I know they must be aching trying to keep up with the brat," I explained, pulling them back into my lap. She was dressed in a robe, after the fashion show, as was Tiffany. 

 By the time I had opened yet another bottle, I was working on her shoulders, her robe pulled down to her arms and Tiffany had responsibility for her feet. 

 "Mmmm. You two are way too good to me," she murmured leaning back against me. 

 "Impossible, Mom. Nothing's too good for you." 

 She scooted back, leaning against my chest, resting. "My babies are all grown up," she pouted. 

 I pulled her upward against me, making her giggle. Wrapped my arms around her, just under her breasts, and started kissing her neck. "We love you, Mom." 

 She chuckled. "Naughty boy. I know you love me, but you don't get to love me." 

 Tiffany had scooted forward and was less than a foot away. I had my foot wedged under the rear cushion so she could get close enough. Mom's thighs were lying across my sister's legs. Her robe was half open, and I saw a glimpse of a pair of her naughtier underwear. Red. I think I would have liked them better in pink. 

 She leaned her head way back, looking at me. "You two aren't doing it, are you?" 

 "Mom!" Tiffany whined. "Not even close!" 

 "I'm still a virgin," I confessed, working one hand inside her robe. 

 She looked sad. "My poor baby boy," she said, reaching back and rubbing my face. 

 Seemed like a good time to kiss her, so I did. 

 She leaned her head against my shoulder. "You like kissing me, don't you baby?" 

 "I love it, Mom. Thank you for teaching me how." 

 My hand had migrated up to her breast, and I was caressing it. "You two are going to attack me again, aren't you?" 

 "No, we're just going to cuddle and kiss, and make sure you know that you're the most loved and adored Mom in the whole world. Right Tiff?" 

 Tiff leaned sideways against Mom, who lifted her arm and pulled her in. "Best Mom ever. I had so much fun today." 

 Mom hummed her happiness. "Me too. We should do that more often. Girl outings." 

 Tiffany moved between Mom's legs and laid on her. They started kissing, and I was hard as a rock. When they stopped, Mom brushed Tiff's hair back. "You... you like boys don't you?" she asked nervously. 

 My sister laughed. "Yes Mom. I'm not a lesbian or anything. I've never kissed a girl before, not like I kiss you." 

 "Then why?" 

 "Because I love you. I love you so much. I want you to be happy. To know you're loved and appreciated." 

 Mom giggled, then kissed her girl. "I'm feeling very loved now. Especially in the small of my back, where someone's trying to poke a hole through my kidney." 

 "Turn over, Mom. Let me love you a little." 

 Tiffany had to move, but after a few seconds Mom was lying down, facing me, and Tiffany was on her side, half on me, half on our mom. Mom's robe was completely open, her bare chest against mine. I slid my hands inside, and kissed her for an eternity. When we came up for air, Tiffany had removed Mom's robe, and hers as well. I was the luckiest guy in the world. 

 Mom turned on her side, and she and Tiffany went at it a while, while I caressed and fondled both their bodies, naked except their panties. Tiff say up and started tugging on my shirt. "I want to feel your skin against mine, Bret." 

 I let them remove my shirt, and then they took turns alternating kissing me. I was kissing Tiffany, and Mom's face was inches away. "My babies are so beautiful," she said. 

 That earned her some loving from both of us. I felt a hand rubbing my cock, and didn't know who it was. A second hand started, and I didn't care. "He's big, isn't he Mom?" Tiffany whispered. 

 "Behave, baby girl. We can't get carried away," Mom said. 

 "I know, but geez! It's huge!" 

 Mom giggled. "It's big. I've had bigger. A looong time ago. This one seems just the right size. Some girl's gonna be very lucky. Now enough of that." 

 Both hands left my wood, and I almost wanted to cry. The girls fixed that by taking turns distracting me again. 

 Mom stopped, letting Tiffany take charge, just lying on me, while I caressed her back. Tiffany stopped, and looked over at Mom. "Your turn," she said, grinning. 

 "I just wanna lie her with my babies, Ok?" she said softly, her eyes closed. 

 "Whatever you want, Mom," I told her, kissing the top of her head. 

 "You two are so bad," she whispered. "Trouble-makers." 

 I held her quietly, while Tiffany and I played the tender kiss game, lips connected, everything in slow motion, gently touching each other. When we stopped I realized that Mom was asleep, or damn close to it. 

 I hated to wake her up, but I did, shaking her softly. "Bed time, Mom," I whispered. 

 "No, baby," she murmured sleepily. "We can't. Not that. I know we want to, but we can't." 

 I chuckled. "Bed time for you, Mom. You're half-asleep. Come on, time to go to your bed." 

 She stretched against me, then sat up sleepily. I sat beside her, holding her, helping Tiffany get Mom's robe back on. I helped her to her feet, hugging her. "Go on now. We'll finish cleaning up in here." 

 We steered her to her bedroom, each stealing goodnight kisses before we let her go. Tiffany and I cleaned up the evidence, and headed to our rooms. "See you in a bit?" she said to me. 

 "Now?" I asked. 

 She shook her head. "Little bit, I promise." 

 I cleaned up for bed, and took another scan through Dad's stuff. Nothin'. I just didn't get it. 

 I was almost asleep, when the clock struck twelve. I sat up, and the door opened after the first strike. I wondered if Tiffany had been waiting outside my door. She walked in, dropped her robe, lowered her panties and climbed in bed. We slipped into each other's arms without a word. Then she slid down my body, and her mouth descended on my cock. 

 "Thank you," I whispered. 

 She giggled. "We had you worked up, didn't we?" 

 "And then some." 

 "That's Ok. Big sis is here to take care of you." 

 She did, and it only took a couple of minutes. I thought for a moment she was going to let me finish in her mouth, but at the last second she pulled away, spraying my abs. She got the paper-towels and cleaned me up. 

 Tiffany wasn't done with me, but the second time, she moved around the bed, straddling my face. I did my best to please her, and had her come for me, before I was ready to shoot again. 

 "Close," I warned her. 

 She reached out and grabbed a couple of the paper-towels, then went back to sucking me. I groaned, nearing my finish. "Tiff," I gasped. 

 Her mouth broke free, and I came for her. I felt her cleaning me, then her mouth settled down to finish the job. She turned in the bed, climbing into my arms. "A good day?" she said, getting comfortable. 

 "Great. I think we may have Mom back in line."

 The next day at lunch, I was stunned when Tiffany sought me out. She had a couple of her friends with her, who normally wouldn't give me the time of day. The cost of being a brain, I guess. 

 She sat down next to me, stealing a fry from my plate. I guess she wasn't planning on staying, her friends just stood there, acting bored. 

 "She's still meeting him," Tiffany whispered. 

 "Crap." 

 She nodded. "What can me do?" 

 I'd been thinking about it. "How'd you and a couple of your friends like to eat dinner at the Marriott? My treat." 

 She grinned. "Six o'clock?" 

 "I'm thinking 5:45, just to be safe." 

 I pulled out my college ATM card. I figured Dad could pay for this one. Besides, it looked like I was gonna save him $80 grand in college expenses. 

 She gave me a kiss on the cheek. "Thanks bro." 

 * * * * 

 I don't know what Mom had told Dad, but she was home at 6:15. Tiffany didn't get home until almost 8:00. Dad and I had pizza. Mom seemed to be a nervous wreck. I didn't say anything, waiting to hear from Tiffany. 

 That is, until she took a phone call, and walked out onto the porch. I couldn't let that stand. I walked out and found her at the end of the deck, talking into the phone. "No, how was I supposed to know? It was just a horrible coincidence, I'm sure... I will. I'll make it up to you..." 

 "Who's that?" I asked, walking up and putting my hand on her waist. I swear she almost jumped out of her panties. "What are you going to make up?" 

 She hit the call end button, and I saw the Fat Bastard's name on the screen before she put it away. "Just your Aunt. Nothing important." 

 I put my arm around her. "Something wrong, Mom? You seem upset or something." 

 She shook her head. "No, I'm fine. Just some work trouble." 

 Work trouble my ass. "Alright. If I can help with anything, just let me know. Let's go in, it's cold out here. You're shivering." 

 She let me steer her back into the house, and I hung around. Her phone rang again, she looked at it guiltily, then ended the call. I'm pretty sure she turned down the ringer. 

 Tiffany came home a few minutes later, in a good mood. She said hi to everyone, grabbed a diet soda, and plopped down next to Mom. "Why'd you run off, Mom? You could have joined us for a while. We were celebrating Karen's birthday."  

 

 

===

Mom glanced over at Dad nervously. "I was just dropping off something for an out-of-town client. I needed to get home." 

 Dad was reading some magazine. "Your meeting went well?" he asked. "Seems like you got home early." 

 "Much shorter than we thought. It was fine." She stood up. "I have a headache, I think I'm gonna lie down." 

 Tiffany and I looked at each other. Things weren't quite perfect yet. I excused myself from the family and hit the books. Paper to write. As much as I wanted to fix things, I needed to keep the 100's rolling in. I figured I'd talk to Tiff at the witching hour. 

 Sure enough, midnight rolled along, and the sounding of the clock preceded my sister's arrival. She had a robe on, but nothing underneath it. She looked gorgeous, but I kind of missed her signature pink panties. She climbed into my bed naked, cuddling up to me. "I think I almost gave Mom a heart attack." 

 "Tell me." 

 "Not much too tell. Mom showed up a few minute before 6:00. She didn't see us and I was watching out for her. I broke from the girls, told them I was going to the bathroom. When the Fat Bastard got there, I walked over to Mom, when the asshole was only a few feet away. I called out to her, and I swear she almost fainted. She looked over at the jerk, shaking her head, like I wasn't going to notice. Of course I asked her what she was doing there, and she freaked. Completely. Like three different excuses before she said she had just dropped something off for some client." 

 "What was Fat Bastard doing?" 

 "Hanging out by the door. I told Mom to come and see my friends, say happy birthday and all. Good thing she didn't. That would have confused them. I told 'em you lost a bet, and had to pay for dinner for me and three friends." 

 "Not too much, I hope." 

 "Not even a hundred bucks. You got off cheap." 

 "And Mom?" 

 "Said she had to go. I told her I'd walk her to the car, and that Fat Bastard glared at me the whole way. I wanted to walk up and slap him in the face." She was rubbing my chest, cuddling sweetly. "How about you? Any news?" 

 "Pretty sure Dad's not cheating, so that's not the problem. The email to Mr. Ellis got weird results." 

 "Weird how?" 

 "Mrs. Ellis emailed Mom. Said someone emailed her husband, and he was so embarrassed. They talked it out, trying to figure out how they could be more discrete." 

 "So he knew about it?" 

 "Looks like it. I guess that didn't work." 

 "We gotta do something. What's to stop Mom from trying to hook-up with the Fat Bastard again?" 

 "I have no idea." 

 We were getting brazen. I asked her to stay with me. I loved holding her. I felt so calm, so soothed, with my sister next to me. She set my alarm for 1/ 2 an hour before Mom got up, and I accepted her back in my arms, happy. Happier than I could remember. 

 * * * * 

 The next afternoon, we kept up the effort to make sure Mom knew how much she was loved and appreciated. Helped around the house, touched her, hugged her, gave her small kisses every chance we got. Tiffany was taking it a step further, doing much the same for Dad. Sneaking into his lap like she used to when she was young. 

 Mom seemed to be enjoying it, shooing us away, telling us to behave ourselves, yet always yielding to our attention. I was getting more and more 'attentive', sneaking a nice breast grope in, rubbing her bottom, nibbling her ear. 

 Tiffany was ornery, wearing a skirt, flashing me her pink panties, getting me worked up. I took it out on Mom, finally pinning her to the laundry room wall, and making out with her. 

 "Bret..." she murmured, while I was pressed up against her, her hands held above her head, my lips teasing her neck, her ear, my hardness pressed against her belly. 

 "Kiss me, Mom. Teach me more." 

 She was whimpering softly, my hand inside her shirt, teasing her nipple, while our tongues battled. "Please, baby. You're driving me crazy, we have to stop," she panted. 

 I released her, taking her in my arms, hugging her. "I love you, Mom. We love you. I hope you understand that. All the love you could ever need, it's here, at home." 

 She squeezed me back. "I know, baby boy." 

 Before midnight, I cleaned up my room a bit. Changed the sheets. Turned back the covers on Tiffany's side, and waited eagerly. I was almost frantic, when the last of the chimes rang out midnight, and she wasn't there. Maybe a minute later, she appeared, removing her robe. "Sorry," she said softly. 

 She was in her panties, those teasing pink panties. She looked down at the turned down covers, rubbing her hands over the new sheets. "I love sleeping on clean sheets," she said sliding in beside me. "I hope you don't mind the panties, it's... that time, you know?" 

 I pulled her into my arms. "I love your little panties," I told her. "I don't mind at all." 

 We talked a few minutes about Mom and Dad. "Something's going on with Dad," she finally said. 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I... you know, how I sometimes sit in his lap?" 

 "Daddy's Princess," I teased. 

 She grinned, blushing. "I could always get a... response from him. A little wiggle, a few kissies, and I knew how much he loved me." 

 "Response?" 

 She reached down and rubbed my hard-on. "Response." 

 "With Dad?" 

 She nodded. "Never did anything. I know it embarrassed him a little, but I never let him know I noticed. Not that I could miss it poking me in the butt. I've been doing it forever. Tonight, no response. And believe me, I tried." 

 That was something to think about. "Is that recent? When was the last time you got a... response?" 

 "I don't think I've sat in his lap for ages. I kinda stopped last year." She wriggled up against me. "You don't think Mom's having the same issue with him, do you?" 

 "God. How would I know? Maybe. If so, that could be a problem." 

 She giggled. "No trouble getting a response from you, is there big bro?" 

 "Not for you. Never for you, Tiff." 

 For some reason, that night was different. Less neediness. We cuddled talked and kissed, caressed each other comfortably. We talked about ourselves, our desires, the last couple of years when we'd grown apart. 

 I learned a lot more about my sister's 'sluttiness'. Her two aborted relationships which involved sex. Handjobs that were expected after a few dates. Her single previous blowjob, which ended miserably. 

 "Tommy was such an ass," she griped. "Got his damn blowjob he'd been practically begging me for. Little prick half the size of yours, that popped in seconds. He got pissed that I wouldn't let him come in my mouth. The next day I found out he was telling everybody how he made me choke on his huge cock, had me begging for it. Slurped his cum like a starving whore. I dumped the stupid jerk." 

 "Why didn't you say anything?" I asked, comforting her. 

 "Say what? To who? What were you gonna do, kick his ass? You didn't even talk to me anymore. Whine about it to my friends? What was I supposed to do? Anything I did, would make me look like a stupid little slut. I dated him for a month. Gave him a lousy blowjob that didn't last much longer than a few sucks. I learned a lesson, that's about it." 

 I felt bad for her. I didn't think about those kinds of things. Being popular, getting a bad 'rep', dating, putting out or not. I had no experience and no brilliant advice. "His loss. I hope his dick shrivels up even smaller," I said. 

 She giggled for me, and we played tonsil-hockey for a while. 

 "Mom's still texting Fat Bastard. Not as many calls, but still communicating. She's gonna try it again," Tiffany whispered. 

 "Probably. All we can do is keep trying, and running interference." 

 I fell asleep cuddling my twin, spooned up against her, her soft breast in my hand, the smell of her hair in my head. I couldn't imagine life getting any better. 

 * * * * 

 I woke when Tiffany did, before the rest of the house would get up. We cuddled a bit, then I hit the bathroom, while she snuck into her own room. I was surprised to hear movement in the guest room, and peeked in. Mom was sleeping there, restless. My heart filled with lead. 

 I went into the room and sat on the edge of the bed. Brushed her hair back. She opened her eyes, seeing me, and smiled. 

 "Why are you in here, Mom? Did you and Dad fight?" 

 She shook her head. "His snoring is getting worse, and he won't see a doctor or anything. It was keeping me up, so I've been sleeping in here every now and then when it gets really bad." 

 I climbed onto the bed behind her, hugging her. "You want me to talk about it with him?" 

 She shook her head. "I don't think it would help. He hates going to the doctor. Doesn't believe the snoring is that bad. I don't think he even minds my leaving. It's not like..." she stopped suddenly. 

 I climbed under the covers with her, spooning her from behind. Pulled her in close, my hand closing softly on her breast. 

 "What are you doing up?" she asked. "This is early for you." 

 "Had to go to the bathroom," I explained. "Sounded like you were having some kind of nightmare. Everything Ok?" 

 She sighed, clutching my arm to her chest. "Just some things I need to work out on my own, baby." 

 "If I can help in any way, you just tell me. I'd do anything for you, Mom." 

 She purred, kissing the arm I'd wiggled under her head. "I know, Bret. You have no idea how good that makes me feel." 

 "Let me stay here with you a while. Go back to sleep. I've got you now," I whispered, kissing her neck. 

 "You're not going to be bad again, are you? I can't take it here, not in bed, just us two. Please, baby..." 

 "No Mom. This is it. I'm here for you. That's all. Close your eyes and rest if you can." 

 The alarm went off, and I woke slowly, feeling her moving in my arms. Her lips touched mine lightly. "That was wonderful, baby," she whispered. "Thank you." 

 "Mmmm," I sighed. "Love holdin' you Mom." 

 She chuckled, "I know. We're gonna have to do something about you trying to poke a hole in my bottom." 

 "Sorry." 

 I got another little kiss. "It's Ok. Kind of nice that someone finds me attractive." 

 "That's silly. Hottest Mom around. MILF Mom." 

 "Do you think I'm a MILF, baby boy?" 

 "Mom, you're the sexiest woman I've ever met." 

 She brushed my hair back, caressing my face. "You're sweet. I'm gonna go get ready. You want me to reset the alarm?" 

 I sat up stretching. "I'll go to my room. Nothing here without you." 

 That got me another kiss. 

 * * * * 

 Wednesday was more of the same. Checking emails. Keeping the grades up. Teasing and loving on Mom. My work on Tiffany's college stuff was seeing some fruition. I forwarded her grades, and wrote what I thought was quite a powerful essay in her name. I accompanied it with one of my own. 

 At midnight, my sister returned to my bed, in my favorite pink panties. I got a nice loving blowjob, and we talked about the fact that Mom's communicating with Fat Bastard was dwindling. At the crack of dawn, Tiffany returned to her room, and I checked. Mom was in the guest room. I went in and cuddled her, no talking, until it was time for her to get up. Had a sweet little cuddling and kissing session with her until she left me. 

 Things were going so well. I talked to Tiffany, and got a list of teacher's she thought would be willing to give her a college recommendation, and tasked her with getting a couple in writing. 

 I got a cryptic text on my phone from Tiffany at the end of lunch. "We gotta stop Mom b4 its 2 l8!" I don't play the texting games, and it took me a moment to recognize we had to stop Mom before it's too late. "Meet me by the gym." I texted back. 

 On the way to P.E. she came running up to me in the hallway, a nervous wreck. 

 "She's gonna do it! Two o'clock this afternoon!" she whined. She showed me Mom's forwarded messages. It was the Marriott again. The Fat Bastard had a room. Didn't they have any imagination? 

 Shit. How could things turn to crap so quickly? How could we stop her, while we were in school? 

 "What are we gonna do, Bret?" she whined, clutching my arm. 

 I had no idea. My brain was a mess, searching vainly for a solution, when fate interceded. Tommy Mecklin, he of the lousy blowjob walked by. He was with a couple of friends, and intentionally bumped into me. "Slut and a nerd," he laughed. Typical bully behavior. Bad timing. 

 I walked over to him, looking up into his face. He was a lot bigger, maybe 3- 4 inches and 40-50 lbs, and I'm not a small guy, at 5'11" 175#. At that moment it didn't matter. "Big guy, big mouth, with the tiny 4 inch cock, that goes off in what? Five seconds? How could anyone be a slut for a teeny weenie, with premature ejaculation issues? No wonder she dumped you, Tiny Tommy. Five Second Mecklin." 

 Half those present were staring in wonder, the other half laughing at him. We had a good crowd, right in front of the Art class, next to the gym. 

 He hit me twice before I even got my hands up. I think I got a couple of good shots in, but that's probably wishful thinking. Got my ass handed to me pretty good, in the few seconds before the teachers broke it up. 

 Five minutes later we were in the principal's office. Tommy was a hot head and a bully. I was the perfect student, soon to be Valedictorian. The teachers had seen him hit me, for no reason. Half a dozen witnesses. 

 Didn't matter. Ours was a zero-tolerance school. I was in a fight. 

 Dr. Thomas looked at me, shaking his head. "I'm sorry Bret, but you know the rules. You have to go home. The minimum is a one day suspension, so you can come back tomorrow." 

 I looked out the glass partition, wondering what kind of punishment Tiny Tommy was gonna get. I didn't feel sorry for him. Assholes deserved what they had coming. "Can you call my Mom, Dr. Thomas? She gets off work at 1:00, and my Dad is all the way downtown, and won't be off until 6:00." 

 "What happened, Bret? It's not like you to get into trouble." Damn, he actually seemed to care. I wonder if they paid him extra for that. 

 "He called my sister a slut. I said something about his manhood, and he attacked me." 

 He shook his head. "It's hard to condemn someone for sticking up for his family. I wish you could have found a better way of handling it. Let me call your mother, and afterward you can wait in the nurse's office, and let her see if she can do something about your eye. You're going to have a hell of a shiner." 

 He looked up my emergency contacts, and I was pleasantly surprised when he caught Mom at home. It was almost 1:30, and I figured she'd be out on her mission of adultery before long. 

 "No, Mrs. Bridges, it's about Bret. He's been in a fight, and has been suspended... No, not Tiffany, although she was a witness, Bret... Yes a fight..." I could hear my Mom's shrieks from 8 feet away. Dr. Thomas pulled the phone away from his ear. 

 "No, he didn't start it, the other boy hit him first, but we have a zero tolerance policy here, and he needs to go home... He's not innocent, Mrs. Bridges, he may have instigated it..." Once again he pulled the phone away from his head, while Mom let loose. 

 "He admitted it to me. He's sitting right here in my office... Yes, apparently the other young man insulted a family member, and Bret felt it was his duty to defend her honor... No, I think it's best that you discuss it with him... It's only for today, he can return to school tomorrow... Yes, he can make up the work... I'm disappointed as well, Mrs. Bridges, it's no way for a Valedictorian to behave... I'll leave a message at the front, you can to straight to the nurse's office..." Poor choice of words. I'm sure people outside could hear my Mom screaming. 

 "No ma'am, he's not seriously injured, just a black eye... Yes, he's going there now, how soon can we expect you?... I'm sorry I had to contact you, I hope it's the last time." 

 He hung up, looking at me. "One angry Momma. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, young man." 

 "I'm sorry, Dr. Thomas. I assure you, it won't happen again." 

 "Let's hope not," he said, the discussion finished. 

 "Do I need an escort to the nurse's office?" I asked. 

 "I don't think that's really a problem, do you?" 

 "No sir." 

 "Send Mr. Mecklin in on your way out." 

 I walked past 5 Second Mecklin. "Your turn, Tiny," I told him. 

 "You asshole!" he screamed, "I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!" He jumped out of his chair, and I heard Dr. Thomas shout, "Mecklin! In here now!" 

 I grinned. Teach him to mess with my sister. 

 I was sitting with a cold compress on my cheek when Mom showed up. From the way she was dressed, I figured we'd barely stopped her in time. She walked up and planted her feet about a foot and a half apart, her arms crossed, glaring at me. 

 "What do you have to say for yourself, young man?" she snapped. 

 I looked her up and down. Four inch heels, stockings, a split sided skirt so short it barely covered her ass. Simple button up white blouse that made it clear she wasn't wearing a bra. Lotsa cleavage. Hair up, full makeup. 

 "Why are you all dressed up? Going on a date? That's not work clothing." I was tired of being subtle. She blushed bright red, her mouth open, unable to answer. "Don't let Dr. Thomas see you dressed like that. He'd send you home." 

 She stood straighter, tugging her skirt down. "Let's go. We'll talk about this at home." 

 It was a silent ride, except for my phone texts going off. I almost never texted but Tiffany was the opposite. 

 What happened? Simple and to the point. 

 Got Suspended I texted back. 

 Shit! Why? 

 Why I got suspended, or why I started the fight? 

 Mom had to come pick me up 

 Mom was glaring at me, texting away. Like she never did, right? 

 :) My genius brother. Love you 

 Asshole deserved it. 2 birds 1 stone. Nobody messes with my sister. The longest text of my life. 

 C U soon. Kisses 

 I put the phone away, and leaned back, feet on the dashboard. My cheek hurt, but it was worth it. 

 Mom broke down just before we got home. "You wanna explain yourself?" she snapped. 

 I'd listened to Dr. Thomas' explanation very carefully. I figure a little white lie might help in the big picture. "He called you a slut. Said you were sleeping around, and everyone knew it. I couldn't let him say that." 

 Mom's look of shock and despair was worth it. "W... why would he say that?" 

 "Don't know. Maybe because of the way you're dressed? Perhaps I was wrong. Do I need to apologize to him, Mom?" 

 We were pulling into the driveway, and I opened the door and got out of the car before it had even stopped. The front door was unlocked from her hurried departure, and I marched in and grabbed one of Dad's beers. I'd never done that without permission. The only thing Tiffany and I were allowed was wine. 

 I was seated before Mom got in the door. She looked nervous when she came to stand in front of me. I could see she was trying to regain control of the situation, and had a determined look on her face. "You know how your father and I feel about fighting. There's no excuse for it." 

 I leaned back, and unzipped my pants. "Mom, if you're gonna talk to me dressed like a slut, I'd prefer if you just got on your knees and sucked my cock, Ok?" 

 She stared at me in open wonder. "How dare you! I'm your mother!" 

 "Are you even wearing panties under that whore skirt?" I asked, pulling out my cock and stroking it. "Why don't you bend over, Mom, and give me a peek. Did you shave your pussy for him?" 

 Mom marched off to her bedroom, and I drank my beer in peace. It was a good 10 minutes before she reappeared, in sweat pants and a t-shirt. Her hair was back down, her whorish makeup cleaned up. 

 As soon as she appeared, I started in again. I was fed up with trying to stop her. "Your phone's been going off constantly. I bet the Fat Bastard is wondering why you're a no show at the Marriott." 

 It was like I'd slapped her. She stopped in mid-step, and I saw her tear up. Within moments she was bawling.  

 

 

===

I felt a little bad about it, and stood, rebuttoning my pants. I took her in my arms, and hugged her. "I couldn't let you do it Mom. I couldn't. Especially not with him." 

 She cried harder, and I drew her down to the couch, holding her while she sobbed. 

 "Why would you do it, Mom? Why? I don't understand. Aren't we enough? Do you really want to break up the family?" 

 She leaned into me, clutching my shirt in her fists, unable to get a sentence out. I just held her, hugging her, rocking her back and forth. "I'm sorry Mom. That was cruel of me. But I couldn't let you do it. I couldn't think of any other way to stop you." 

 "You... you got in a fight on purpose? To stop me?" 

 "I didn't know what else to do. I was desperate." 

 "But your school record! Your grades, Valedictorian," she whined. 

 "I was suspended for less than three hours. No tests today. I'll be fine." I squeezed her. "Even if it meant getting expelled, I'd still do it, to keep our family together." 

 "What do you know?" she asked hesitantly. 

 "Everything. The dirty messages, him showing you his 'lumber'. The hickey on your tit. Your date Monday night, which Tiffany had to interrupt. Aunt Tina's and Mrs. Ellis' affairs." 

 She was quiet. "It was you, sending the email to Warren." 

 "I was hoping that if you saw the damage cheating caused in one family, you might think twice about destroying ours." 

 "Francine isn't cheating. He knows about it. Her situation is a lot like mine. You shouldn't have interfered." 

 "She was trying to get you to cheat. She and Aunt Tina. Does Uncle Tim know too? Does he approve?" 

 Mom shook her head. "And all this fooling around the last week or so?" 

 "To let you know how much you're loved. You're not, what was it... unappreciated, unloved, unfulfilled. I don't know what we could do about being unfulfilled, but we had to let you know you're loved and appreciated." 

 She sighed, resting her head on my shoulder. "You don't understand, you can't..." 

 "Dad's not having an affair. He wouldn't." 

 Mom murmured. "I know. Can't might be a better way of putting it." 

 "What's going on, Mom? Why would you do this?" 

 "It's your father, Bret. We think it's his blood pressure medicine or one of his other meds. We haven't made love in over a year. A year," she whined. 

 "But the other day, your shower together..." 

 "He tries baby. God love him, he tries so hard. He can sometimes get it half up. He'll do what he can to pleasure me. Hands, mouth, some... toys. But it's not the same." She sat up and put her arm around my neck, staring into my eyes. 

 "I'm going crazy, Bret. Over a year since I've had sex. Your father and I, we've always been great together. A wonderful sex life. Other couples do it maybe once a week, a lot of times less. Not us, two or three times a week was common. From that to nothing. Nothing!" 

 "Isn't there drugs, something?" 

 "He tried Viagra, had a bad reaction to it. We tried a different medicine. He bought the toys to use on me, but none of it worked. He stopped doing anything with me over 4 months ago. Now he's talking about testosterone injections." 

 "But your boss? That fat bastard?" 

 She heaved a huge sigh. "It was just teasing. Maybe a little dirty, but I wasn't really going to do anything with him. It was nice to be desired, and to see how crazy I could drive him. I honestly don't think it would have gone anywhere, but then you two started in. Teasing me, driving me crazy. I was so fuckin' horny all the time, and you and your sister just made it worse. I finally broke down and agreed to meet him. It was stupid, but I... I needed something." 

 "But what about Dad? What if he found out?" 

 She sank into my chest. "Your father's the best man in the world. He feels horrible about everything. About six months ago, after another miserable attempt, he held me and told me that he understood. If I ever felt I needed to do anything, I should do what I had to. He didn't want to know, and would never ask me about it. I couldn't believe he was giving me permission! God, I loved him more than ever, but knew I could never do that to him. So I gave up on sex, got myself off with my toys and a dirty story. Decided that I'd rather be with my family in a sexless relationship, than be fulfilled." 

 "Unappreciated, Unloved?" I asked. 

 She glared at me. "I don't know how you got into my private correspondence, but I had a bad day, Ok? I was feeling low. I was dressing up for your father, hoping for a little interest, but I was getting nothing. Not even what he could do. It was like he didn't care about sex with me anymore. If I wanted it, I had to practically beg for it." 

 I guess we'd been talking for a while. Tiffany burst in the house, slamming the door behind her. She saw us sitting, and ran over. "It wasn't his fault, Mom," she started. 

 I shook my head at her. "It's over, Tiffany. I told her we know. Why we did it, trying to stop her. Everything." 

 Mom reached out and took Tiff's hands in her own. "I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean for you guys to get concerned." 

 Mom looked back at me. "Why don't you get us a bottle of wine, while I try to explain things to your sister? You might want to put some ice on your eye as well." 

 Alright. I guess I was dismissed. I did as Mom asked, pouring them some wine, and leaving them the bottle. Got the proverbial frozen bag of peas for my eye. The old grandfather clock started chiming, and I realized it was barely three o'clock. Tiffany must have cut her last period P.E. again. When I took my seat with Mom and Tiff, Mom wasted no time climbing in my lap, nor Tiffany cuddling up. 

 "You know the answer's obvious, Mom," Tiffany started. 

 Mom shook her head. "I know what you're going to say, baby. But it's out of the question." 

 "Why?" 

 "You know why. It's wrong," Mom argued. 

 Like Tiffany had reminded me on our first night, she has a stubborn streak a mile wide, and always gets her way. I don't know how she does it, but she's merciless in pursuing her idea, once she's convinced she's right. Aggravating, but I love her anyway. "Face it, Mom. There's one man in the whole world, one, who you know loves you, would never hurt you, who would do anything for you, and who you know will be discrete. That, and is physically capable of taking care of you. Just one. It's obvious." 

 "I... I can't. I just can't, honey. Please understand..." 

 I slipped my hand in Mom's shirt, feeling her soft flesh, breathing deep, smelling her perfume, her shampoo. Smells that had been with me all my life. My Mom's smell. I pulled her head down to my shoulder, kissing the top of her head. "Don't worry Mom. We're not gonna make you do anything. I promise." 

 Tiffany, on the other hand... "One choice, Mom. That or nothing. 'Cause I swear, Bret and I are gonna make sure you do nothing to mess up this family. That means especially with the Fat Bastard. I'll hound you to death, if I have to. Bret too. You want to see him get in trouble again? Jeopardize his future for you? Next time he's suspended, it'll be three days minimum, you know that, right? And they don't let him make up his work. I may not matter, I'm not going anywhere, but Bret? Bret's never done anything wrong. Never. Is that what you want, Mom?" 

 "Please, baby," Mom whined. "I won't do anything. With nobody. I... I'll live without, I've done if for a year..." 

 "Mom, stop talking nonsense! You're 43 years old. Do you really think you can go the rest of your life without sex? That you should?" She was rubbing her hand on Mom's leg, and I hadn't even realized my hand was back on her breast, cupping it. My lips pressing the side of her head. 

 "What happens when the next Romeo starts making a play? But this time he's taller, sexier, younger. He presses his big hard cock against you, flirting. You haven't had it in years, and the young hunk wants you. How are you going to resist? How Mom?" 

 "Don't be ridiculous. Why would a young stud want me?" 

 "Why don't you ask him?" Tiffany said softly, glancing at me. 

 Mom turned her head and looked at me. Her eyes gazed into mine. I felt her breath shortening, her nipple turning hard in my hand. "Baby, we can't," she whispered, her lips looking so ripe, so ready, moist. "I'm your..." 

 I pressed my lips to her, kissing her fiercely, as she'd taught me. The kiss of dominance, of need. Her breath rushed out of her body, wheezing through her nose, as my tongue claimed her mouth. I pinched her nipple, tugging it, making her moan. 

 "Nobody could want you more, Mom," Tiffany whispered, leaning against us hugging us both. "Nobody. He's hard for you isn't he?" 

 Achingly. Mom whimpered softly. 

 "Nobody will ever know, Mom. Just us three. He'll take care of you. I'll help him. You'll never go to bed aching in need. No more slutty clothes, no more flirting with scum. You'll come home to us, your family, and we'll love you. Love you like nobody else ever has, ever could. That's the answer, Mom, and you know it. It's gonna happen, and all you can do is delay it." 

 My kissing slowed, becoming more intimate. I leaned back against the couch, retreating slowly. Mom followed, pursuing, showing me how it was done, dominating me, making me hers. 

 "Your baby boy, Mom. Made for you. Nobody could ever love you more, or better. His cock's massive, aching to be inside you. Stretch you out, fill you. You know you want it, you deserve it. It's been a year." Evil Tiffany had removed her shirt, and moved to sit on my legs, behind Mom, forcing her into my body. 

 Mom gasped, grinding against my erection. "It's wrong, Tiffany." 

 Tiffany reached down and dragged Mom's shirt up her body, over her arms, leaving her topless in my lap. She pushed Mom's head back down to meet mine, our lips colliding, teeth clashing, tongues fighting for control. Mom whimpered, and I felt Tiffany's hand pushing mine aside, claiming Mom's tits. 

 "Who could ever love your tits more, Mom? Who? You fed us with your body. Gave us life. These tits, Mom. Our tits. One each. Sealing a relationship for life. We're yours, and always will be. Just like you're ours." 

 Mom was struggling to resist. "My babies, Tiffany. You're my babies. I... I can't. God knows I want to, but we..." My lips cut her off, demanding her attention. 

 "We will, Mom. I swear we will. You can't stop us. You're ours. You have been for every single day of our lives." 

 Mom gasped as Tiffany's hand slid inside her sweatpants. "This is ours. We came from here. Lived in your belly together for nine months. Caused you pain and suffering, made your life miserable, and all you ever gave us was your love. Now it's our turn, Mom. We're gonna love you totally, unconditionally. We're taking our first home back. This naughty pussy needs to be stretched again. Stretched by your son. It's gonna happen." 

 Mom groaned, her lips slipping away. "If we do..." 

 "When," Tiffany insisted, and I shushed her, pressing my finger to her lips. "If we do, what?" 

 "Nobody can know. We can't go crazy. Just often enough to keep my sanity," Mom whispered. 

 "Of course, Mom," I said, kissing her cheeks, her nose. "Nobody will ever know but us. I promise." 

 "When your Dad gets better, it has to stop. He's my husband," she said, her voice firming up. 

 "Our Dad. We know. You're his, and if he could do it, we'd never interfere. We would never have done any of this, if we didn't love you both, and want to save the family." 

 "It can't interfere with your schooling, your future," Mom said. 

 "It won't." 

 "I... we... we have to act normal, no more craziness." 

 I kissed her lips softly. "A little craziness. We'll dial it back." 

 She grinned, and I knew we had her. "Only a little. Discretely." 

 "It's a promise." I kissed her lips, and she kissed me back, I felt the passion and desire. "I'm going to fuck you now, Mom." 

 She looked up at me, "Just like that?" 

 I nodded. Tiffany scrambled off my lap, and I stood with Mom, her legs wrapped around me, her arms clinched around my neck. "It's been a year," she whispered, her head on my shoulder. 

 Tiff led the way to my bedroom, opening the door, and pulling back the sheets. I laid Mom on her back, and my sister closed the door. I reached down and tugged Mom's sweats off, seeing her privates for the first time, in a long, long time. I dropped to my knees, leaning down to kiss her there, and she backed away centering herself on the bed. "Not now baby. Twelve long months it's been. I've had all the oral I can stand. I need a cock, your cock, inside me now. No more foreplay, you and your sister have been driving me crazy for far too long. You need to fuck me now. Fuck me like you promised, Bret." 

 Tiffany was working my pants off while Mom talked, and I tore off my shirt. I kicked my shoes off, and Tiffany took my cock in her mouth, sucking me sloppily, getting me even harder if it was possible. "Fuck her, Bret. Fuck Mom," she growled. 

 I was a little scared. Scared I'd fail her. I had no idea what I was doing, I only knew I wanted it more than I had ever wanted anything. 

 Mom looked up at me, and grinned. "Baby boy. You can do no wrong with me. Don't worry, it'll be perfect, Ok? Trust me?" 

 I nodded, climbing between her legs. 

 "Good. Then stick that big fat cock up inside me, and fuck Mommy's brains out." 

 I pressed the head against her, and she reached down, guiding me home. "Yesss," she hissed, as I entered her. 

 "Fuck me baby. Give it to me." 

 I pushed it inside her, and leaned over her, as I'd seen on video. Moved my hips back, feeling the incredible sensation of sliding through her moist flesh. Back in and out. Slowly, treasuring each moment, locking it in my memory. 

 "Harder, faster, baby. Fuck me, please," Mom pleaded. 

 I adjusted my legs and drove in and out of her. Fucked my Mom. Pierced her with my cock. Stretched her pussy, filling her. I looked down and saw tears in her eyes. "Welcome home, baby boy," she whimpered. 

 I brought myself down, my hips moving incessantly, instinctively. My lips pressed against hers and she moaned so sweetly it gave me goosebumps. "Teach me, Mom. Teach me how to be good for you. Make a great lover out of me." 

 "Later baby, for now, do what you want. What you need. Fuck me. Pound me with your cock. Don't stop, don't slow down, don't worry about me. Just fuck me." 

 I wrapped her in my arms, my weight pressing her into the bed. Smelled her hair. Opened my legs and found a position where I was comfortable. 

 I fucked her. Fucked her hard and fast, relentless. Only slowing when I got tired, resting for a few seconds, and then hammering at her again. She was gasping, fingers digging into my flesh. 

 "Fuck her, bro," Tiffany said. I peeked over and she was lying beside us. Naked except for her panties. Pink panties. Teasing pink panties. 

 I turned to face Mom, feeling the excitement building. I know it had only been a couple of minutes, but there was no way I could stop. Harder and faster I pounded into her, before gasping, shoving my cock deep inside her, and erupting. I groaned as I shot rope after rope of cum inside my sweet Mom. 

 "Can you keep going? Nice and easy for a bit. Stay hard for me, baby boy. Big and hard. Take care of me, Ok?" 

 I kept thrusting, slowly, and felt my sister's fingers caressing my balls from behind, touching me where I entered Mom. 

 "Is it wonderful?" she asked softly 

 "Incredible," I groaned. 

 Mom pushed against my shoulders, moving me off of her, until my weight was resting on my arms. "Sit up baby," she purred. 

 I did, and she opened her legs. "Hold them. Hold me open, and play a bit. Get used to your new playground," she teased 

 My hands slid behind her knees, holding her legs open. I looked down and saw where I was entering her. God, that looked incredible. I stiffened almost immediately, grinning as I saw my own cock swelling, stretching her. 

 "Mmmm," Mom sighed. "Like that. Make me take all of it. Deep. Fill me." 

 Tiffany scrambled across the bed, lying down next to Mom. "What's it like, Mom?" 

 Mom lifted her hands to her own breasts, caressing them. "You're not a virgin too, are you?" 

 Tiff shook her head. "Two guys. Six times altogether. None lasted as long as Bret that first time. Neither went twice in a row." 

 Mom pulled her close, hugging her. "It's magical, baby. Incredible. Have you come on a cock?" 

 Tiffany shook her head. Mom chuckled. "Don't worry. I'll make sure you come on his. You guys are doing it right?" 

 Tiff shook her head again. "I've blown him. He's gone down on me. That's all, and it's new. Just started." 

 Mom groaned. "We'll... talk... later," she gasped. "Promise... Ok?" 

 Tiffany kissed Mom and I played, wiggling my hips, feeling what different angles were like, getting comfortable, sliding my cock in and out of Mom endlessly. 

 "Don't... tease... baby," she moaned. "Fuck me!" 

 I did better the second time, lasting longer. Mom pulled her legs back. "Raise up," she said softly. "Up." 

 I lifted my hips, getting above her, pounding downward. "Deep and hard. Finish... hard. Slam... me." 

 It was almost work, athletic, raising up on my hands and toes, and hammering my cock into Mom from above, driving her into the bed. She started grunting, little nonsense sounds escaping her lips. "Don't... stop," she groaned. 

 Like a machine, taking the strain, feeling the sweat start to bead on my flesh, I pounded her. Filled Mom's sweet pussy. Owned it. Claimed it. Her hands clawed into my forearms, fingernails digging in. She looked in pain, gasping, her body twitching. 

 "Harder, Bret," Tiffany whispered, her hands running over my body. 

 I grunted, shifting, and used my entire body weight to drive Mom through the mattress. The whole bed was bouncing, headboard creaking. Mom seemed to almost crying, every other stroke gasping for breath, "Unh... unh... unh!" she grunted. 

 "Faster," she pleaded. I was nearing the end of my strength, desperate to please her. I was sweating heavily, drops of my sweat falling from my nose, my chin, my forehead, landing on her grimacing face. I couldn't let up, climbing even higher, slamming my hips into overdrive, my thighs trembling, abs aching. 

 "Yes... yes... oh, Oh OOOH FUUUUUCK!" Mom screamed scaring me, her entire body bucking, legs tensing. Her fingernails dug in hard, drawing blood. I felt her pussy pulsing around my cock. I strained, gasping, suffering as I tried to keep it up for her, keep pounding, for Mom. She needed it, and there was no way, no way in hell I was going to fail her. 

 She gasped, her body jerking against me, crying out, her entire torso tense, muscles straining, before she released my arms with a groan, her body collapsing back onto the bed. 

 I couldn't do it. God I wanted to, but I couldn't keep it up. My arms were shaking, the beginning of a cramp starting in my leg. I had my eyes closed in concentration. I could. I could do it. One more. One more. And another. Another. 

 "Bret," Mom said shaking me. "Bret!" I opened my eyes. 

 "Easy, please," she begged. 

 I collapsed, to my knees, her legs moving down with me, wrapping around my waist, keeping me close. I was breathing like I'd finished a marathon. 

 "Oh, baby. It's not supposed to be work," she said. 

 "For... you," I gasped. "Couldn't... fail you." 

 She chuckled. "God, you definitely didn't fail me." 

 She pushed me away, and put me on my back. "I'm sorry, I needed that so badly. I... I didn't mean to use you." 

 "Use me, Mom. Let me be whatever you need." 

 Tiffany was sitting watching us. "Are you Ok, Mom? He didn't hurt you did he?" 

 Mom laughed lying down and playing with my cock. "Sweetest pain in the world, Tiffany. My boy made me come. Come hard. First time in forever." 

 She took my cock in her mouth, sucking me. "God, Bret. You have the perfect cock. Perfect. Thick, but not too thick. Long enough to reach everything, but not too long to hurt. I think we're going to become great friends, this big guy and me."  

 

 

===

Mom sucked me, and I knew I'd never get enough of that. Incredible. 

 "God, Bret! You're bleeding all over the place!" 

 I looked down and saw rivulets of blood running down my forearms. I turned them and saw three crescent cuts, where Mom's fingernails had pierced the skin. 

 Mom released my cock. "He'll get over it. Little love scratch. Get him a Band- Aid, baby girl." 

 Mom sat on one leg, her hand stroking me. "You didn't come?" 

 "Couldn't. It was too difficult. Couldn't even thing about it." 

 She grinned. "I know what will do it for you." She turned around and got on her hands and knees. "Like this. From behind. I'll bet you like it. All boys do." 

 She was right. I liked it. A lot. Loved the way it felt. The way it looked. Holding her hips, controlling the speed. It was a lot less work, slowing down, speeding up when I wanted to. Looking at my Mom's bottom. The crack of her ass. The marks on her soft cheeks, when I dug my fingers in. The crinkle of her butthole, flaring when she gasped. I felt the urge to come rushing upon me. "Mom," I groaned, thrusting deeply, filling her again, feeling the exquisite release. 

 I collapsed on the bed, and my sister put on her Sisters of Mercy cap and starting wiping the blood off my arm, cleaning me up, applying the Band-Aids. Mom had lain still for a moment, after I came for her, but she was back between my legs, her naughty mouth licking and sucking, cleaning me. 

 "Mom," Tiffany whined. "That's gross." 

 Mom looked up at her, and broke out laughing. "I hope you're kidding, baby girl." 

 "God no! It's all messy." 

 Mom smiled, and sucked me into her mouth, holding me, her tongue teasing, the suction pulsing. When she was done, I was half-hard again. 

 "There's only a few rules of great sex, Tiffany," Mom explained, licking my cock and stroking me. 

 "First, don't be afraid to try anything and don't be afraid to ask." She gave me a strong suck again. "Like I asked him to get up on me, and give it to me hard. It was what I needed, and he came through like a champ." Another deep suck, and she looked up. 

 "Second, you have to let go. Let go completely. Give yourself over to your lover, trust them, surrender. Be fearless." She bobbed her head up and down on my cock, and I watched Mom's beautiful face, my Mom's face, loving me. 

 "Third, if you're a guy, and you want the best from your woman, do whatever it takes to get her going. Lots of foreplay, kissing, teasing. Go down on her, get her blood boiling, keep at it until she's desperate for you." She was stroking me, and stopped to give me a few long licks, kissing the head of my cock. 

 "Fourth, if you're a woman, and you want the best he can give you, you don't let up. Love his cock, suck him hard, make him ready for a second, third, fourth go. Treasure those few inches of magic between his legs. Worship it. He'll know, and he'll be desperate to please you. If that means cleaning him up in between, and sucking him till your jaws ache, do it!" 

 She sucked me like she meant it, looking up at me, her eyes pleading for more. When she released me from her mouth, I was stiff as steel. Mom giggled, looking over at Tiffany. "See. He loves me. He's gonna take the best care of me he can." 

 Mom straddled me, and eased my cock back between her legs, slowly lowering herself. "God," she moaned. "So fucking good. Perfect." 

 She started a little rocking motion, sliding forward and back, my cock barely moving, shifting. Mom smiled for me. "I'm gonna play a while now, Ok? Let me know if you need anything different." 

 Mom turned back to Tiffany. "Finally, and this really comes under the same rules as the first two, don't be afraid to talk, to moan, to scream for him. Let him pleasure you. A good man will want you to come. They love it. Love to know they can do that to you, make you lose control. Don't worry about getting sweaty or dirty, where your juices are. If it's too much, just shower and keep going. Cast all your worries and concerns away. No guilt, no fear, no worries. Just love each other." 

 Mom was moving a little faster, she had a cute little rhythm going. She looked down at me. "How did it feel, baby, to make Momma come like a freight train? Did you like it?" 

 I nodded. 

 "Did it make you feel a little like I was yours, you owned me, controlled me? Owned my pleasure?" 

 I blushed, and nodded again. 

 She leaned forward, hands on my chest, her hips moving in little circles, grinding away. "Good. 'Cause you do. I'm yours now. When we're in bed, I'm yours, to do what you want. I trust you. Trust you to make it as wonderful for me as I'm gonna make it wonderful for you. You understand that, right?" 

 She was breathing harder, her motion forward and back again. "You Ok, baby? This is not uncomfortable is it?" 

 "Wonderful Mom. I love it." 

 She grinned. "I bet I know why?" She looked over at Tiffany who was lying down again, just taking it all in. "Do you know why?" 

 "'Cause you're doing all the work?" 

 "God, no!" Mom laughed. "They love to be in control. Shall I tell her?" she teased me. "It's the view. Looking up and seeing your love, our tits shaking for him. The expressions on our face." She looked back down at me. "You like watching Mommy fuck you, baby?" 

 "You're so beautiful, Mom. I can barely stand it." 

 "Grab my hips baby. Show me. Fuck Mommy." She lifted her hips off of me, and I grabbed her ass, pounding up into her. "Yesss," she growled. "Fuck me. Take me, you horny, teasing little bastard. Fuck my brains out." 

 My hips were out of control, slamming upward as fast as I could, taking her, until I collapsed back downward with a gasp. Mom lowered herself, and started the slow grinding again. "Like this, Tiffany. Take turns. We need this, the rolling, the grinding, the pressure. He needs the pounding, the long strokes. I can come like this, come over and over for him, but I gotta give him something." She rose up again. "Give it to me, baby boy. Claim your pussy." 

 I hammered her again, my cock hardening, listening to the slap of our flesh, the nasty wet sound of taking her. When I slowed, she bent over, her hands beside my head, and started rocking. Back and forth, my cock sliding in and out of her, all the way in, deep. 

 "Compromise, Tiffany. Like this. He gets the stroking, I get the full feeling and a little grind at the end. Make sure you're nice and low, legs open, dragging across him at the end." 

 Mom smiled for me, rocking away, her tits swaying in front of my face, I turned my face struggling to capture a nipple between my lips, ebullient when I did. Sucking, sucking Mom's tit. 

 Mom trembled, her head lowering, closing her eyes. "So good, Bret. You feel so good in me." 

 I didn't answer, content to suck her tit. 

 The rocking felt good. Wonderful. Slow and easy. Mom sped up a little. "Gonna... come," she groaned, her pace barely changing, the motion absolutely incredible. "Coming..." she gasped, and she pushed back, taking all of me, trembling beautifully. 

 Her breath started up again, in bursts, and she was moving again. "Any time you want, Bret. Don't hold back." 

 "I'm good Mom. It feels great." 

 She smiled and sat up, back to the forward and back grind. Mom looked over at the clock. "Tiffany, be a dear, and get the big casserole out of the freezer. Turn on the oven to 350. We need to get dinner started soon. Your father will be home in an hour." 

 When Tiffany left, Mom leaned over and kissed me. "What do you want, baby boy? Is this good? You want on top? How can I pleasure you?" 

 "From behind again?" I asked. 

 She grinned. "You're such a man, Bret. I should have known. Let Mommy have a couple more like this, and you can take me. Take me rough from behind. Alright?" 

 I nodded. 

 Mom took control, no more talking. Alternated between the upright grinding, and leaning over me and rocking back and forth. She came for me twice, sitting upright, then rocked back and forth building up to a big one, she had with Tiffany watching us again. 

 She kissed me, and climbed off. Turned and put her knees on the edge of the bed, bending down and raising her bottom up. "See if you like this, baby." 

 Standing behind her, I found she was right again. I loved it. Even easier to rock back and forth into her, or grab her hips and pound her hard. She lowered her head to the bed, only her ass raised up for me. I liked that a lot. Enough to push her head back down when she started to raise up, leaning over and pounding into her. "Mine now," I groaned. "Mine, Mom." 

 She moaned, her legs trembling again. "Yours, Bret. Take me. Take me hard." 

 I squeezed her ass cheeks in my hands, claiming her, until I exploded hard enough to see black for a moment. 

 Mom was mine. 

 * * * * 

 Epilogue. 

 Mine for about four months. 

 After our first time, we kept up a little of the teasing Mom, stealing kisses, touching, groping. We figured out a way to get together pretty regularly, Mom and me. 

 Dad was still snoring, and Mom would leave to go to my bed, at least a couple of times a week. Any fishing trips or sports outings were spent in bed, all three of us. 

 When Mom wasn't in my bed, Tiffany was. We learned out lessons from Mom, and practiced diligently. I knew I loved her, more than a brother should. But we were more than brother and sister. 

 I brought Mom in on the secret, as soon as I learned. We set up a surprise for Dad and Tiffany. Fancy cake, candles, the works. It was a few days before Christmas, and I'm sure they had no idea what was going on. 

 The cake said "Congratulations, Tiffany." I handed her the envelope when she asked what for. Her acceptance letter from UTD had her screaming in joy, leaping on me, almost destroying the table as she took me to the floor. I think she forgot where she was for a second, kissing my face a dozen times, before her lips settled on mine, long, deep, loving. 

 Dad gave a not so subtle cough, and she lifted up, blushing. "How?" she asked, slowly climbing off me. 

 "I talked to admissions, pleaded for a package deal. You and me." 

 "But Harvard? M.I.T.?" 

 "Wouldn't mean a thing without my family around." 

 We celebrated, and I explained my plan for us to live at home for the first year, and use the extra $8,000 a year to help pay her tuition. 

 Dad would have none of that. "You save that money, Bret. We'll pay her tuition. Hell, I was worried you'd somehow get her into someplace expensive and we'd have to figure out how to come up with $40K a years. We can manage $10K." 

 Christmas night I got my reward, and she let me come in her mouth for the first time. She didn't like it, but was willing, and I loved her for that. I held her, kissing her sexy lips. "You don't have to do that ever again, but I love that you were willing to try." 

 She grinned for me. "We'll do it again. It may taste like shit, and feel like snot, but I love the way you look when I did it. I owned you." 

 I laughed. "You did. You do." 

 We were discrete. I honestly believe Dad never knew a thing. We were careful. Not always. I got carried away a couple of times. Caught Mom leaning over the sink doing dishes, while Dad was outside working on the lawn. I started teasing her, and she dropped her pants. I took her there, listening to the lawnmower. I fucked her for as long as I could. The mower outlasted me, and I came inside her. She calmly pulled her panties and pants back up, gave me a hot kiss, and told me to go outside and help Dad. 

 I'd get worked up now and then, when we had a little time. After school, before Dad got home, or after he went to bed, and the three of us would be watching TV. I'd ask Mom to suck me, and she almost never denied me. She had no problem with swallowing either, teasing my sister about her finickiness. I loved Mom's naughty mouth, almost as much as her sweet pussy. 

 Very sweet. Believe me, I know. I spent a hell of a lot of time between her legs, learning my lessons. Tiffany was very appreciative. 

 For Valentine's Day, Mom introduced me to something new. It was the day after Valentine's Day, actually. She slept with Dad on Valentine's Day, but I got my gift on February 15th. Mom's ass. Tiffany was with us of course, and we got the full training lesson on how to do it, build up to it, loosen her up. It was incredible. Not the feeling so much, just that we were doing it. It was only the one time, but I'll never forget it. 

 Tiffany had much less problem with anal than she did with swallowing. It became a pretty regular thing with her. Not every day or even weekly, but probably at least once a month. She gets in the mood, and won't settle for anything else. Stubborn. She likes it more than me, but I remember Mom's rules, and I'm happy to do what I can to make her happy when we're in bed. 

 Dad got a new doctor, and a nutritionist. Changed his diet, and they made him exercise. He bitched a lot, but lost 20 pounds, and his blood pressure got good enough to take him off the meds. March 27. I'll never forget it. It was the last time I made love to Mom. Dad was back, and she didn't need me anymore. At least not for that. 

 It was hard for me. God, I missed her, missed making love to her, missed falling asleep with her in my arms, missed the intimacy, the stolen moments. But I knew it was the right thing to do. Tiffany took care of me, loved me when I was feeling down. My sister's arms were a place of refuge. 

 Mom would come to me sometimes late at night. Slip into my bed, opposite Tiffany, and hold me. The first time I cried like a baby. I didn't want to, tried to hold it back, but lost it. She held me, told me how much she loved me. How much she appreciated what I'd done for her. I reached for her breast, felt her nipple harden. After a few seconds she pulled my hand away, brought it up to her mouth, kissed my fingertips. I was the glistening in her eye, when she put it on her hip, instead of back on her breast. She used her mouth one last time to get me hard, and held me while Tiffany rode me. 

 Mom held Tiffany's hand the whole time. When I came for my sister, Mom sat up and kissed her. "He's yours now, baby girl." It broke my heart to see her walk away, tears streaming down her face. I think it was almost as hard on Mom as it was on me. Tiffany held me for a long time. She loved me and got me through it. 

 I graduated as the Valedictorian. I stood proud, in front of my class, my family, my Mom. Rotten Tiffany flashed me her pink panties, and I got tongue tied in the middle of my speech. I made her pay for that one. Two loads in her mouth. She was changing, the second one was her idea. 

 It's a little over a year since I lost Mom to Dad. Sometimes I walk down memory lane and I think about what we had. But Tiffany and I are celebrating. We've found an apartment next to campus, which I can pay for with my school funds. Tiffany is as smart as I said. She's carried a 4.0 GPA her entire first year, once she buckled down. I got my first B, ever. You can bet I never heard the end of that. 

 I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I go to bed every night with my beautiful sister, holding her in my arms, together again. I don't know how, but we'll work it out. I'm never going to let her go. Never. 

 And still, there's a part of me that aches every now and then. A loss I'll probably never get over. Mom was mine, all mine, and now I've lost her. To the only man I could stand to. My Dad. It doesn't make it hurt any less. Report_Story
