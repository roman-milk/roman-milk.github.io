 Sweets revenge exposes a weakness and opportunity

 ======================== 

 I love Halloween. The unapologetic, over-the-top nature of the whole holiday. An excess of candy, a shortage of material in costume making, a handy excuse for the wildest party of the year. Black and white horror films. Technicolor home displays. The sluttification of the American woman. The perfect excuse to scare your friends. 

 Did I mention the candy? 

 Our office has a break area supplied with drinks and snack. Mostly soda, water, some juice, and something over-caffeinated in the fridge. Chips, cookies, crackers, nuts and fruit in the cabinets and on the counter. 

 Halloween brings the candy. Mmmm. Chocolate. 

 It starts a couple of weeks early, when the over-sized, individually wrapped goodies come out for Halloween, and it continues for another week of decadence following the Trick-or-Treating, when everyone brings in their excess remains. 

 Our admin is a cutie, young and definitely OCD. Everything has to be in order, lined up, organized, everything in its place. I can see why my office drives her nuts. She gets fidgety whenever she's in there more than a few seconds. I made her sit through a conference call once, and within minutes she lost it and was sifting through my desk contents, stacking, moving, lining things up. I kept smacking her hands away, and 30 seconds later she'd be back at it. Embarrassed, but unable to stop. Cute as hell. 

 I stop by her desk a few times a day, checking on mail, assigning some minor tasks, sometimes to chat. She's a sweet girl, pretty, almost finished with college, which she's completing part-time. Wears nice little cleavage exposing tops at least once a week or so. Bless her little heart. 

 Briana does the snack buying, and I noticed she had a penchant for M&Ms. Regular, no peanuts, pretzels, or peanut butter. Simple candy coated chocolate heaven. I personally am a fan of the Hershey Kisses. How simple and elegant, teardrops of endorphins, individually wrapped. Melt in your mouth goodness. 

 I couldn't help notice how she'd grab a handful of M&Ms out of the candy jar, and lay them out in orderly little piles, sorted by color and number. Sometimes they'd be lined up, other times separated into groups. Boxes of 4, curved rainbows, triangles, concentric circles. There was always an uneven number to start, more of the greens and oranges, maybe the blues, a shortage of yellows, reds, browns. She'd work to even it out, eating the excess quantities down until they were nicely balanced, then continuing to bring the number down until there were one or two of all the colors equally. She worked from left to right (never right to left) or top to bottom, until they were all gone by the end of the day. One good size fistful to start the day, lasting all eight hours. 

 I'd been giving her a hard time. We were out of Kisses and dry roasted peanuts, but the M&M jar was still a third full, so no shopping. On the third day of shortage I was leaning over the edge of her desk, eyeing her neat little piles. Time to ratchet things ups. 

 I commenced my terrorist campaign. 

 Let's face it. Engineer's are a weird bunch. Nothing half-assed in our plans. If we're going to do something, no reason not to do it to excess. 

 When Briana returned from lunch, she was faced with an epic disaster. In a line of M&Ms six long, and three deep, the fourth from the left was missing. There was a note, written in newspaper ransom font. 

 "WE GOT RED. KISSES OR SHE GETS IT." 

 I had a perfect view of her response. I had adjusted the entrance camera to look down on her desk, and had tapped into the IP feed. 

 She appeared to be in shock. She shrugged it off, and sat down, a few minutes later moving the M&Ms around, into different patterns. She always came back to the same three lines, in the same order. Green, orange, blue, red, yellow, brown. And that sad gap where one was missing. 

 She got up and went to the kitchen, returning with one red M&M. Damn. Such a beautiful plan, such a simple flaw. Briana slipped it into the opening and went back to her work. 

 For about 10 seconds. 

 She turned back and moved the one new red M&M. Adjusted its position. Turned it upside down. She finally picked it up, looked at it and popped it between her pretty red lips. Leaving the huge cavity in her design. 

 Thirty seconds later she was standing in my doorway. "I want it back," she said, looking so determined. Adorable. 

 "I'm sure I don't know what you mean," I said calmly. 

 She walked over and stared down at me from her lofty 5'5", including three inch wedge heels. Wow. I rated. She'd put on her shoes to confront me. "Give it back." 

 "You know what it takes," I told her calmly, continuing my typing. 

 She turned and stomped out of my office, "You can be such a jerk, Zach." 

 "Thank you, please come again," I called out after her. 

 I brought the video feed back up and watched her angrily push the candy pile to the side, making a jumble of it, getting back to some form she was working on. That didn't last five minutes. She turned to the side, her hands practically shaking, rearranging the piles, desperately. Seeing her like that I started to feel bad for her. It was a real compulsion. 

 Damn. It was just a joke. I didn't want to do that to her. 

 I unlocked my file drawer, reaching to the back, and pulling out the tiny little clear plastic box I'd put her M&M in. A joke. I looked up as Briana burst into my office, closing the door sharply behind her. She leaped upon me, pressing her lips against mine. She bit my lip, her tongue brushing against my teeth, her breath heavy. 

 She pulled back, her eyes on fire, chest heaving. "There. Now give her to me." 

 I was shocked, and on the verge of groveling for treating her like that. But I couldn't. It was too damn funny. "Chocolate Kisses, Bree. We're out of chocolate kisses." I pushed her little captive red M&M out in front of me. 

 She picked up the box, clutching it to her chest, blushing. "I'm so sorry, Zach," she whispered, bringing her hand to her mouth. 

 "Three days we've been out. It was only meant to be a little reminder," I told her. I wanted to hold her, calm her, but I was afraid. The office. Sexual harassment. The age difference, only about 10 years, but it seemed like 20. 

 "Don't tell, Ok? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that," she whispered, literally shaking. I could swear she was on the verge of a breakdown. 

 I couldn't stand it. "Shh." I whispered, putting my arm around and her and walking her back to her desk. I didn't give a flying fuck if anybody saw. 

 Standing in front of her candy pile, I took the plastic pillbox from her and opened it. I placed it next to the colorful stacks. "You rescued her. Bring her home." 

 Briana fumbled twice, her shaking hands unable to pull the red M&M from its temporary home. She ended up turning the box over, dumping it out and pushing it in line with the others. She pulled it out again, turning it upside down so the imprinted white 'm' was on the top. She turned it so the printing was straight, and slid it back in place. 

 I saw the tenseness disperse, and she sat back in her chair, obviously relieved. She grabbed the first M&M in line, the green one and popped it in her mouth. She grinned at me, leaning back in her chair. Suddenly so calm and collected. 

 "I'll get the Kisses tonight," she said. "Hershey, chocolate Kisses." 

 "I'm not picky about the brand. I suddenly find myself a fan of all types of kisses." 

 She grinned. "I bet. You say one word about this, and I will make you pay forever. Believe me, Zach. I can make your life hell." 

 I shrugged. "Or heaven." I leaned over. "Sorry, I was only teasing," I said softly. 

 She gave me a sweet little smile and a wink. "I know. We're cool." 

 Her phone rang, and she looked at the number. "I have to take this. It's important." 

 I nodded, turning back to my desk. 

 "Mom? Everything's fine..." 

 Back at my desk, I couldn't stop thinking about her, and that kiss. I kept the video feed up on my desktop, while working. She had slowly worked her way through the first three M&Ms and had come to the red one. She picked it up and moved it to the back row, eating the one she'd replaced. 

 Still awfully cute, for a nut job. 

 I watched her all afternoon. I felt like a damn stalker. Hell, who am I kidding, I was. It was that damn red M&M. I kept waiting for her to eat it. She always ate all of them, before she left at 4:30, on the dot. 

 It was 4:28, and three M&Ms remained. Red, yellow, brown. Briana had already turned off the computer, and cleared her desk. A spotless surface except for those three colorful chocolates. She suddenly reached out and grabbed all three of them, putting them in her mouth. That lasted a good 5 seconds before she was spitting them back out into her hand. She put the red one to the side, and popped the other two back into her mouth. I saw her trembling hand pick up the last lonely survivor. She opened her drawer, pulled out a napkin and patted it dry. She pursed her lips and blew on it, examining it carefully for damage. I watched her open her center drawer and pull out the pillbox. She glanced up at the clock, placed Red back into the plastic home, and locked her away. The clock still read 4:30, the second hand sweeping past the nine. She grabbed her purse and keys, running through the door. On time as always. 

 I stayed late. Very late. Doing something I should have done months before. 

 * * * 

 I strolled in around 9:40. We have flex hours, 9:30 to 4:30 the core hours when everyone is supposed to be in the office. I usually make it by 9:30, but I wasn't a stickler. We didn't punch a time clock, and as long as you're in the right ballpark, nobody cares about a few minutes now and then. 

 Briana was sitting in my office. "It's 9:42," she said, exasperated. 

 There was a little pyramid of Kisses in the middle of my desk. 

 "I'm sorry." I was. I imagine those 12 minutes were hell for her. 

 I sat in my chair, the desk between us. "Kisses for me?" 

 She grinned. "Chocolate only, if you can't be on time." 

 Flirting. Cute. Adorable. "I won't be late again." 

 She ran her hands across my cleared desk. Nothing but a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and my phone. She looked around the office. Spotless. "Did you do this for me?" she asked softly. 

 I nodded. "I don't want you uncomfortable when you come in here." 

 She smiled, and stood up. "You didn't just throw it all in a drawer, did you?" She opened the overhead cabinets, seeing all my books neatly stacked. She reordered a couple of them, and moved to my drawers, opening them and looking inside. She had to make a change everywhere, stacking pads, moving a stapler, shifting empty folders to the back of the full ones, instead of the front. 

 When she closed the last one, she went back to her chair, sitting back, relaxed, obviously happy. "Must have taken you a while," she said. 

 "And then some." 

 She stood again, leaning over the desk toward me. It was cleavage day, and I got quite a nice glimpse of flesh. "That was sweet," she said softly. She reached out and pulled the top Kiss off my neat little pile. She opened it slowly, pulling the little piece of white paper out and straightening it, then stretched across and put the chocolate to my lips. I opened my mouth and accepted her little gift. Briana rolled the foil into a tiny ball, and dropped it in the garbage can. She ran the paper through her fingers, until it was nice and straight. 

 "Be on time tomorrow, or no kisses for you." 

 I watched her on camera during the day. Not compulsively like the day before, but occasionally, smiling to myself each time she changed the pattern of her piles or ate another one. She had the little pillbox out, pushed back out of view, behind her pill piles. 

 I stopped by and chatted a moment, looking at her neat little groupings. "How's Red?" 

 She blushed. She pulled the little clear box forward. "I couldn't do it. She's not a candy now. She's the queen of the M&Ms." 

 "Lucky girl. Gets to sit up here with you all day." 

 "How were the kisses?" she asked. 

 "Sweet as always. Melt in your mouth goodness. Not as nice as yesterday's of course." 

 "No? That's too bad. Next time I might have to look for a new brand." 

 By the end of the day, her pile was gone, and at 4:30, Red was in her protective box, hidden in a drawer, and I was online doing a little shopping for my M&M girl. 

 * * * 

 I was at my desk at 9:20. At 9:30 on the dot, Briana walked in looking around the office, obviously checking to see if I'd maintained it in good order. She closed the door, until it was open only a couple of inches. She walked over to the window and adjusted the blind so it was even at the bottom, and ran her hand down the slats, making sure they were all in place. Turning back to the desk, she opened her bag and took out four Hershey kisses. She put three in a neat little triangle, and turned the fourth one upside down in the middle. Exactly the same as the day before. 

 "There's one missing," I observed brilliantly. 

 She leaned against the desk next to me. "Goodness. I guess there is. We'll have to fix that." She leaned in and gave me a sweet little kiss on the lips. Nothing crazy, only a soft pucker, not even any tongue. 

 Even so, she had my heart racing. 

 "Better?" she asked, turning to the door. 

 "Yes. I like that brand a lot better." 

 She laughed opening the door. "I'm sure you do. Enjoy your kisses." 

 I watched my girl during the day, playing with her candy, entertaining Red, and going through her typical work day. I spaced my own kisses out during the day, imagining replacing each with a real kiss. My new favorite brand. 

 I left a note on her desk. "Wait for me, before you get your M&Ms." 

 * * * 

 At home my package had arrived. $65 for a less than a pound, rush, overnight delivery. Expensive. My adorable admin was definitely worth it. 

 * * * 

 I showed up early, knowing that she'd probably get edgy, breaking up her routine. At 7:58 she was organizing her space, unlocking her drawers, putting her purse in the back of the bottom right, hanging up her jacket. At 8:00 she was seated at her desk. She looked up at the clock, moved her mouse and logged into the computer. 

 I stopped by a couple of minutes later. "Let me know when you're going to get your snacks," I said. 

 She barely looked up, scrolling through her email. "Nine o'clock." 

 At nine, Briana was standing in my door, punctual as always. I got up and walked with her to the break-room. She walked over to the M&M jar, and I stopped in front of it, reaching into the cupboard, top shelf. I brought down the jar and passed it to her. 

 She was nicely surprised. I watched her open the wide mouth jar, dipping her hand in and retrieving a fist full of M&Ms. Three colors only, light pink, dark pink and red. She lifted one up and looked at it. On the reverse it had my name, ZACH. She grinned. "Your brand?" 

 I nodded. "Not near as nice as yours, but I thought you might like to give it a try." 

 She shook her head. "I can't eat these." 

 I closed the jar, and put it on the top shelf. "You have to, or I won't let you see the next batch." 

 She laughed, such a sweet carefree sound. She was beautiful when she laughed. "Ok, I'll give them a try. It's going to be hard to beat the originals." 

 "A try is all I ask." 

 She retreated to her desk, and I watched her play with her new M&Ms, sorting and organizing them. At 9:30 she walked into my office, giving a quick look around. She partially closed the door, came over beside me, her cute bottom resting on my desk, and put three Kisses on my desk. 

 I pouted. "I was gypped." 

 She giggled and brought her lips to mine, kissing me softly, lingering, her tongue brushing my lips for a moment. She brushed her hand against my cheek, as she pulled away. "Still feel gypped? 

 I shook my head. 

 "You can have the other one after you take me to lunch. 11:50. Don't be late." 

 At 11:40, I looked up into my admin video feed, and she was playing with the M&Ms. She moved her hands, and I saw she had created a heart, the dark red M&Ms on the outer edge, two interior rows of light pink, the rest of the center filled with the dark pink. She ate three of the dark pink ones, leaving a hole in the middle where she quickly place Red, clear case and all. 

 She looked up, glancing around and quickly re-segregated them into three piles. She put Red away, and turned off her monitor. 

 I minimized the camera feed, grabbed my wallet and keys, and hurried to her area, glancing up at the big clock facing her desk. 11:49. At 11:50 she stood and passed me her jacket. I opened it for her, helping her put it on. She pulled her purse out of the bottom drawer, locking her desk. 

 In the parking lot she took one look at my car and came to a dead standstill. After a few seconds she looked over at me. "Can we take my car?" she asked. 

 She gave me her keys, and I unlocked the doors, opening hers for her, closing it securely once she was inside. I got in the driver side, adjusting the mirrors and seat. "Any place special?" 

 She smiled. "I imagine any place you take me will be special." She looked down at her watch. "Fifty-four minutes." 

 Plenty of time for almost anywhere, but I didn't want her stressing. I had a feeling I knew someplace she'd like. Call it a hunch. 

 We pulled in front of the large restaurant. It advertised a Chinese buffet, but the real prize was the sushi. Usually twenty or more types, with two sushi chefs behind the counter constantly restocking. The lunch buffet was $8.99, $12.99 with the sushi. 

 Briana was in heaven. She went through the buffet, selecting half a dozen different types, a few of each. She made patterns, by size and color, before eating the first one. I saw a beautiful smile appear on her face. "It's good," she said. 

 "You like sushi?" I asked. 

 She giggled. "A little late to ask." She picked up a second one, tuna. "So far I do." 

 "Your first time?" 

 She nodded, blushing. "In a lot of ways. Thank you, Zach." 

 I showed her how to take the wasabi and mix it with the soy sauce for dipping. It took her a couple of minutes to get it the way she wanted, then tested it with a piece of Salmon, evening her plate down to two each of five different types. Four pieces as spikes of a wheel, with two pieces of spicy volcano roll in the middle. 

 I got a kick out of trying to teach her how to use chopsticks. I thought it was interesting that she had no problems with the new type of food, and utensils. Then again, what did I know about that kind of compulsion? 

 It was nice. We chatted about work, about the upcoming holiday, the merits of M&Ms vs. Kisses. There was little awkwardness, and a surprising level of comfort. 

 With ten minutes to spare, I had paid the bill, and was helping her with her coat. The restaurant was less than 5 minutes from the office, but I didn't want her getting nervous if I pressed the time. 

 She grinned as she got in the car. "I would have been good for a couple of more minutes," she said, almost apologetically. 

 "I'll remember that next time." 

 "You think there's going to be a next time? After that stunt you pulled kidnapping Red?" 

 "Kidnapping? I was the one who saved her. I had heard she was going to be eaten before 4:30 pm. Such a cruel fate." 

 I hadn't started the car. And our time was ticking away. "I had an ulterior motive for leaving early," I confessed. 

 "You? Ulterior motive? I'm shocked."

"I was hoping to collect on my missing kiss." 

 She leaned toward me smiling. "I think that's only fair. It was a very nice lunch, thank you." 

 I met her halfway, our lips coming together gently. Hers parted against the pressure of my tongue, allowing me access, teasing and tasting her. I hated to pull away, but time was of the essence. 

 I started the car before she was even leaning back in her chair, turning into traffic. I looked over at her, eyes almost closed, smiling at me enigmatically. "You're not what I expected," she said softly. 

 "Ditto, and then some." 

 She laughed. "Oh, I know I'm seriously fucked up, but you...you surprise me." 

 "I hope in a good way." 

 "Definitely. Most definitely. Thanks again. I was very nervous about this, and I can say, without the least hesitation, that was the best date I've ever been on." 

 "I get to call it a date?" I teased. 

 "It ended in a kiss, didn't it?" 

 "I'd like to date you again." 

 "Me too. Let me have a little time to digest this one first, alright?" 

 "Whatever time you need." 

 I got out of the car, and ran around to her side, to open her door. She'd started to open it but stopped, and waited for me. I helped her out, closing the door behind her, and passing her the keys. 

 "You didn't open the door for me on the way there," she observed. 

 "I didn't know we were on a date. I'm sorry." 

 She leaned in and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "Forgiven. I like sushi." 

 * * * 

 Our second lunch date, three days later, and less than a week until Halloween. I had called ahead to the restaurant, and asked them to have the food ready when we arrived. Briana was surprised, but delighted when an assortment of finger-food appetizers was presented to us, on two large platters. 

 "Appetizers for lunch. I hope I wasn't too presumptuous." 

 She was already making patterns from our snacks. She was giggling, in a great mood. "Double kisses for you today. This is the best ever. I can take what I want, and you get stuck with the excess. It's perfect." 

 She took a bite of something deep-fried. "What are these round things?" she asked. 

 "I have no idea. Probably fried zucchini or something similar." 

 She put them on my plate, opening up space on hers for arranging. "I hope you like them. They taste like poop." 

 "Thank you so much for letting me have the good stuff," I kidded. She was right. They weren't very good. "Reminder to self. Double mini-burgers, no fried poop, next time." 

 Briana smiled and reached for the last slider. I beat her to it. 

 "No! He's mine. I saw him first. I opened a space for him and everything," she whined. 

 "You snooze, you lose," I told her, lifting it teasingly, for a big bite. 

 "Please? You can't devour him, it's not fair. He has to go last." 

 "Last?" 

 "He's the tallest. Last. It has to be." 

 "What will you trade for him?" I asked. 

 She pouted. "I already promised you double kisses," she said softly. 

 "From your plate. I have to eat too. Not just the fried poop. Trade for him." 

 "Oh," she said blushing. She eyed her plate, moving the food around, and freed up three items. "Fair?" she asked. 

 I tried to act like I was thinking hard. Fist to the bottom of the chin and everything. 

 "What? It's a good deal," she griped. 

 "Sorry. You got me thinking about the kisses. Much better deal." 

 She grinned. "You like?" 

 "Very much." 

 "If you can be by my car at 4:35, one Big kiss. Fair trade?" 

 "More than fair. I feel like I'm cheating you now." 

 She took the slider off my plate, moving the other three items onto mine. "That wasn't the deal." 

 "Eat. You're going to need your strength." 

 She was right. At 4:31, I was standing by her car waiting. She walked over casually, unlocking the car from a distance, opening the passenger door and putting her purse inside. She walked around the car and slid into my arms as if it was the most natural thing in the world. 

 I was expecting the kiss, but was very glad for the long extended hug. 

 She looked up at me expectantly, and I brought my lips down to hers. It started slowly enough, brushing our lips together, puckered little kisses. She pressed her little teeth against my bottom lip, tugging softly. I ran my tongue across her upper teeth, feeling their sharp, perfectly aligned bottoms. Her mouth opened, pressing forward, her tongue pushing against mine, sliding around it, her breath flowing into me. 

 I let my legs slide outward, pulling her body closer, connecting from hips to chest, my arms drawing her tighter. She made the sweetest little whimper, opening her mouth and letting me explore. 

 I felt her tremble, and backed away slowly, worried that I had pushed things too far. "Are you Ok?" I asked, looking into her eyes, looking for any signal she was uncomfortable. 

 "No. I'm scared." 

 "Why, Bree? What did I do wrong?" 

 "Nothing. That's the problem. It's all too good. It has to blow up in my face. I don't deserve this," she said nervously. 

 I kissed her forehead, her narrow little turned up nose, her soft lips, her sharp chin. "Give us a chance, don't be afraid of something good happening." 

 She trembled, burying her head in my chest. "Slowly, Zach, Ok? This is all so new to me." 

 "Kisses?" 

 "Everything. It should be more difficult than this. It can't be this easy. Nothing new ever is." 

 I stroked her back, showering kisses on the top of her head. I decided to change the subject. "A friend of mine is having a Halloween party. Usually a pretty big blow-out. Would you like to go, Saturday?" 

 "I don't do well at big parties." 

 "What do you normally do for Halloween?" 

 "Dress up and pass out candies. I like to see all the kid's outfits. We get a good sized crowd in my neighborhood." 

 "Would you like company?" 

 "You'd be bored. You should go to your party," she said. 

 "I'd love to spend the evening with you, passing out candy, and maybe watching a couple of old movies." 

 "Are you sure?" 

 "Absolutely positive. Please." 

 She gave me a squeeze. "No later than 6:00 pm. Dress up." 

 "Thank you. I'll be there." 

 "Nothing too crazy either. My parents always stop by. I can't tell them no, just because I have a date. Not on Halloween." 

 "Understood. Family friendly costume." 

 She gave me a little kiss. "Was the Big Kiss worth that silly little burger?" she asked. 

 "Worth the whole friggin' restaurant." 

 She chuckled. "Why do you have to be so sweet?" 

 "It's all the kisses. Chocolate and otherwise." 

 "Mmm. Remind me to keep you fully stocked." 

 I opened the door, before returning to work. Costume. I had an idea. 

 * * * 

 Two more lunches before the weekend. Both times a delight. I wanted to see more of her, after work on a real date maybe, but I didn't want to push her. The more I thought about her comments, how everything was new to her, the more nervous I got. Did she not date? Was I her first 'boyfriend'. I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders to be as good as I could be, for her. 

 I found the costume I was looking for online. Paid a fortune for overnight shipping, and then set in to do some customization. Several hours Friday evening and a few more Saturday morning, before I was happy with it. 

 * * * 

 She'd said no later than 6:00, not at 6:00, so I felt fine showing up at 5:45. Early enough to allay any concerns about my being late, while giving her plenty of time to get ready. 

 I rang the bell, and a large, make that huge, man opened the door, dressed as Frankenstein. I had to look up at him, his head higher than the door. Jesus, must have been close to seven feet tall. 

 He stuck his hand out, and it swallowed mine. "I'm Brian, you must be Zach." He looked me over, smiling. "I see you know my daughter pretty well." 

 He stepped back out of the doorway, gesturing me to come in. "The girls are still getting ready. You know how they are, everything has to be perfect. To the last detail." 

 I nodded, grinning. "Women." 

 "Especially these two. Like mother like daughter." He walked toward the kitchen, while I followed, still stunned by his size. "Angela usually has her issues under control, and the drugs help. Briana's trying to deal with it on her own." 

 He passed me a beer from the refrigerator, opening his. "You don't mind if we talk about this? We probably won't get another 5 minutes alone. You should know what you're walking into." 

 "I don't mind at all. I appreciate it. She doesn't talk much about her family life. Nor about her condition. She does seem to have it under control, as long as she stays on schedule, and we leave her personal space alone." 

 "You understand, if you're going to date her, your personal space becomes hers?" 

 "I figured that out. Got my office in order, with her approval after a few minor changes. Detailed the car and even organized the trunk." 

 "Containers," he said softly. "For some reason, things in containers don't bother them as much. A messy container is a very minor nuisance. Even a simple box in the back seat of the car for anything loose, helps a lot." 

 "Has your wife always been this way?" 

 "As long as I've known her. If you have any questions, anything, ask. Call. Anytime. I'm serious. Day or night. Anything at all. This isn't easy. Not for either of you. You're the first man she's gone out with more than twice. That says a lot to me. I'm pulling for you." 

 "Thanks. I'm going to take you up on that. I hope for a very long time." 

 He grinned. "That would be good. We only want her to be happy." 

 I heard the women in the other room. He perked up, and walked toward the living room. "Coaster, at least an inch away from any edge of the table. Ideally geometrically placed," he said softly. "By the way. Good choice on the costume. Homerun. You'll see." 

 We walked out and I saw his wife. Bride of Frankenstein, in miniature. She looked like a doll. Even shorter then Briana, with a Marge Simpson hairdo in black and silver. Tight torn mini-dress, black fishnet stockings. Wow. She walked over to me, and gave me a hug. "I'm so glad to meet you, Zach. She can't stop talking about you." 

 "Mom! Gosh!" I turned to see the most adorable sight. A giant Hershey kiss, must have been four feet across at her thighs, if it reached that low. Her legs were encased in white fishnet stockings. She was wearing a smaller Kiss for a hat, and long white gloves. Little white streamers, labeled with "KISSES" stuck out of her hat and the back of her outfit. 

 She smiled, walking over. "I know how much you like Kisses," she said. She looked me over, grinning. "Looks like great minds think alike." 

 I was dressed as a huge bag of plain M&Ms, dark brown wrapper, from shoulders to knees. Black pants and a black turtleneck complete the ensemble. 

 Briana giggled. "God, that's mean. I haven't had a single M&M today." 

 "Ready for a little treat?" I teased, reaching down to my waist, and opening one of my customizations, a pocket, around belly-button level. 

 "Zach!" she gasped, blushing. 

 "Trust me, sweetie. Reach in." 

 She closed her eyes, turning away from me, and slid her hand into the opening. She laughed, pulling out a hand full of loose M&Ms, in her three custom colors. She popped one in her mouth, gave her mother one, then dropped to her knees, organizing them on the table. 

 I sat on the couch, placing my beer on a coaster as I'd seen her father do, the coaster touching the corner edges of one of the four large square patterns embedded in the wooden surface. 

 "Any more surprises in there for me?" she asked. She reached over and nudged my coaster a hair. I couldn't even see the difference. 

 I reached into the two side pockets, equally hidden, pulling out mini-bags of M&Ms. "Plain and Peanut." 

 Any more teasing was interrupted by the doorbell ringing. "It's starting!" her mother exclaimed, clapping her hands like a little girl. I could see where Briana got her cuteness from. Her mother must have been at least 40, but she seemed like a teenager. Friggin' adorable. 

 Briana finished her M&M segregation, hopped up and ran to the door, the bottom of her outfit bouncing sexily, teasing, not quite showing what she was wearing underneath. 

 Any ideas I had of watching a movie were quickly abandoned. Briana was right. The kids didn't stop for hours. She and her mother had a system, a large table around the corner from the front door had an assortment of candy arranged in organized piles. Briana would select the treats to distribute, and pass them to her Dad. He'd hold them on a tray while Briana's mother delivered them to the trick-or-treaters. 

 I felt like an outside observer, until Briana got me involved, opening bags of candy and putting them on her table, for her to reorganize before sending them out the door. 

 It was a blast, talking about the kids outfits, hearing about past costumes, and the Halloween house decorations. The parents were subtle, sliding in a few more personal questions now and then, family size, schooling, job, but only rarely, and never more than one or two without a break. 

 I didn't mind sharing, since they were doing the bulk of it. Angela was a tease, surprising me by giving me a hug from behind. "I'm so glad you're here with us, Zach." 

 "No Mom!" Briana snapped, giggling, slapping her Mom's hands away as she pulled them out of the front pocket, M&Ms in her greedy grip. 

 "They're mine," Briana laughed, grabbing at her Mom's hands, trying to open them. 

 "Brian!" her mother called out. "Help me!" 

 He laughed. "You brought this on yourself Angie, I'm staying out of it." 

 They were obviously having fun, and I didn't want to interfere. A group of kids walked up to the door, and I intercepted them. 

 "Trick or treat!" the four ankle biters called out. 

 I reached into my side pockets, pulling out some of my M&M treats. I was happy to get rid of them, they were heavy, and I figured they'd be melting before too long. 

 I dealt with the crowd of four, 2 mini-bags each, and looked back to see the girls gigging, wrestling. Angela had her hands at her mouth, struggling to eat her treat, while her daughter was trying to pull it away. "My hair!" her mother whined. "Don't mess up the hair." 

 I looked over at Briana's father, and he shook his head. Don't get involved. Seemed like good advice. 

 I had another group of three coming up the walk. Tots. I was a little surprised they were still out, it was getting late. I knelt down in front of them, and when they made their plea for candy, I reached into my outfit and passed out the bags. 

 "Mom! I can't believe you! He made those special for me," Briana whined. 

 "I didn't raise you to be selfish," Angela teased. "I'd share with you." 

 Briana came over and without a word reached down my front, coming up with some more treats. She walked over to her Mom, holding them out. "Mom, they're not normal M&Ms. They're for me. Look." 

 I could feel myself blushing, as Angela looked the candy over. "Oh, sweetie. I didn't know. I'm sorry. I was just playing," she said. 

 I watched and Briana went to her table, segregating the candies, and coming up with two extras. She gave her father one, and gave her mother the other one. "I'll share. But don't take, them, please." 

 Her mother took her by the hand, and sat down with her. "Relax, baby. I won't take any more, I promise. I didn't know, Ok?" 

 Briana, was sitting anxiously, moving the candies around, pushing two to the side, before she seemed to settle down. She moved one of the extras in front of her Mom, holding the other one, waiting for her Mom to eat hers. 

 I dealt with a new crowd of kids at the door. When I finished with them, Angela was standing beside me, looking nervous. 

 She leaned against me. "Please tell me she's not some game to you." 

 I shook my head. "No way. Sweetest, most fascinating girl I've ever known," I said softly. I watched a crowd of six come running up to the door. Tween-aged, their parents standing out by the curb. 

 Angela reached into my side pocket, making me nervous, pulling out a handful of candy packages. I grabbed several from the other side. 

 "Girls like Briana and me," she said softly, passing out the candy. "We know we're a handful. We are slow to grow attached to our guys, but we are absolutely devoted once we do. Give us a chance." 

 "Anything I can do, I'm committed to making this work." 

 Briana moved up on the other side of me, "Leave him alone, Mom. Please, you're embarrassing me." 

 I turned, reached out to her head, pulled her forward and kissed her softly. "Your Mom's great. She only wants the best for you. Me too. I'm nuts about you, you know?" 

 She blushed, smiling. "Not too crazy for you?" 

 I shook my head. "I'm gonna screw up now and then. I don't know how to handle some of this. You need to be open and honest with me. I'll get better." 

 She looked on the verge of tears. "I don't know how. You've been perfect." 

 I laughed. "You're setting me up for a fall. I'm not perfect. Far from it. But I'm willing to do whatever you need. Whatever. You only have to let me know." 

 She smiled. "I could use another kiss." 

 Angela tugged me away. "Incoming. Keep the kisses indoors, kids. Impressionable youngsters are watching." 

 The number of kids had slowed, but a trio was laughing, walking up the path. I felt the hands sliding down my sides, retrieving the treats. "One of each, for each of them," Briana said, three bags in her hands. She flipped them over so all the writing was going the same direction. 

 One brown bag, one yellow bag for each of the kids. I looked up and saw a virtual army of kids on their way. There must have been at least a dozen. 

 "You have enough for all of them?" Angela asked. I could feel her hand moving around, checking how many bags were left. There was a small problem. It wasn't really a pocket. There was a bag attached to the opening, and pinned to my pants belt. It was easy to reach inside and miss the bag. Angela seemed to discover that, giggling as her hand felt around, rubbing my side. 

 "Seems like it," Briana said, pulling out a handful. 

 "There were 40 bags of each," I told them. 

 I felt her hand slide back into the gap on my side, and struggled not to make a scene, when she discovered the same issue, and her hands started rubbing my hip. "Feels good on this side," she giggled. 

 "Briana..." her mother whispered, warningly. As if she had any room to talk, her hand was being wicked, inside my outfit, rubbing my side and upper thigh, only a scant couple of inches from really being naughty. 

 The kids were upon us, and the girl's hands kept slipping in my outfit, retrieving bags, each of the them putting a package of M&Ms into the goody bags held up before them. 

 Briana was keeping her near hand inside my outfit, leaning close to me, crushing the side of her outfit. She'd pull out a candy, then slide her hand back in, and give me a teasing rub before snagging the next treat to be passed out. 

 Angela was no better, her hand never leaving the pocket for long. Her hand was more exploratory, wandering around, front and back. She gave my ass an unexpected squeeze, and I almost jumped. 

 The last of the trick-or-treaters left, and Briana leaned over, looking around me. Her hand was still in my outfit. "Mom! What was that?" she hissed. 

 "Nice buns," Angela giggled. 

 "Dad!" Briana, called out. "Mom's being bad." 

 "God, Briana, I can't believe you told on me!" Angela whined. 

 Brian walked up behind her, picking her up bodily, hoisting her high, like a toy. "Jesus, Angie, we've just met the boy. Give the kids some space, before you scare him off." 

 "We're just playing around, Brian," she whined. 

 I laughed. "She's not going to scare me off. I love the fact that the girls are close. My sister and my Mom don't get along all that well." 

 "See?" Angela whined, wiggling in his grip. Her struggles had the bottom of her dress riding high on her hips, her legs kicking. A tiny little black thong was exposed, along with a red and black garter belt. Sweet Jesus. Her mom was hot.  

 

 

===

We seemed to have weathered the storm. We hadn't seen a kid for a few minutes. A group of teenagers came running up to the door, and I felt like something was missing when Briana pulled out the candy, my other side lonely. 

 I reached into the pocket, and Angela was there, slapping my hand away. "I'll be good," she said. 

 "You better," Briana teased. 

 "That was mean, telling on me," Angela pouted, whispering to her daughter. "Remember, two can play that game, sweetie." 

 "What? You're going to tell on me? I didn't do anything. He is my date." 

 "Your costume?" Angela teased, warningly. 

 "Mom! You promised," Briana gasped. 

 "I never thought you'd tell on me," Angela said sadly. 

 Their hands were back to being bad, although they seemed to be ignoring me other than as a candy dispenser, and a body to be teased. 

 "I'm sorry, Mom. Dad's not mad. He knows we're just playing around. I didn't mean nothing by it." 

 "Still, you never told on me before," Angela said. She seemed upset. I put my arm around her, and she leaned into me. Her hand moved to the back, rubbing my rear. Her husband couldn't have been 10 feet away, putting away the last remnants of the candy. 

 "This is different, you know?" Briana said softly. 

 "I know, sugar. I only want to help. I like him. He's not like the others. More like your dad." 

 I was nervous. Briana's hand was on my backside, only a couple of inches from her mother's. I felt a little more movement, and the hands were together. Weird, but nice. 

 "I know Mom. I know you want to help. Some things I need to do for myself. Ok?" 

 "You're sure?" Angela asked nervously. 

 "No," Briana said softly. "I'm scared. I can't let that stop me." 

 Angela let go of me, and moved over to her daughter. She reached up and hugged her, and Briana turned and hugged her mother almost desperately. "Thanks for being here," Briana said softly. 

 "Always baby. Whatever you need from me or your Dad. I love you." 

 Briana gave her a big squeeze. "I know, I love you guys." 

 Angela, let go of her daughter and stood in front of me. She reached her arms up and I leaned over, letting her wrap her arms around my neck, while I gave her a hug. 

 "She's worth it all," Angela whispered into my ear. 

 "I know. I'll try to be worthy." 

 She almost broke my neck she squeezed so tightly. "You are. Be good to her. Gentle and slow, Ok?" 

 "Gentle and slow." 

 She gave me a quick kiss on the lips, surprising, even with all the teasing going on. She pulled away, before turning to her daughter. "Can I have a couple of the special ones, before I go?" 

 "Not too many," Briana said softly. 

 Angela reached into the front pocket. She pulled out a few and looked at them, sorting out two of each color. She slid her hand back inside and I got goosebumps when she reached down my front, her hand rubbing against me. I was hard, not too surprising, and she gave my shaft a squeeze. She gave me a wink, and turned to her daughter, showing her hand. "Two of each? One for me and one for your dad?" 

 Briana, nodded. 

 Angela turned away. "You done in here?" she called out. "I think it's time for us to head home." 

 Briana walked in, closing her door, and turning off the outside light. I emptied my side pockets, only a handful of packets left from each side. 

 Her parents said goodnight, her father giving me a crushing handshake. "Call, anytime. I'll understand, and help where I can." 

 "Dad!" Briana griped. 

 "You're difficult. I love you baby, but God knows you're not easy to be around sometimes. There's going to be times when he needs help maneuvering the mine field." 

 "Geez, you make me sound like some kind of ticking time-bomb. You're supposed to be on my side." 

 "I'm on your side. But us guys got to stick together. I saw you two ganging up on him." He gave me a wink. 

 Angela gave me a hug. "Wonderful meeting you, Zach. I hope we get a chance to really get to know each other. Don't be a stranger." 

 I hugged her back. "I had a great time tonight. Thanks for everything, and making me feel so comfortable." 

 She gave me a quick kiss on the lips, gave her daughter a hug, and they departed. Briana rushed off to the kitchen, and returned with a big empty jar. "Special M&Ms. In here." 

 Clearly, she was anxious, so I dumped them in the jar, making sure to get all of them. She put a lid on the jar, and shook it. She took the jar to the pantry, and put it on a shelf. After that I could see her body relax. I was starting to recognize her stress symptoms easier. 

 She walked to the cabinet, pulling out a few liquor bottles. "I need a drink. Can I make you one?" 

 "Sure, whatever you're having." 

 Briana poured out equal parts of Amaretto, Grand Marnier and Southern Comfort into a mixer. She was careful, precisely filling her jigger, two ounces of each, twice. She put the shot glass in the sink, rinsing it out. She covered the shaker, giving it a good shake, and filled two glasses, until they were exactly even. She took a big sip of hers, sighing. I accepted mine from her and gave it a sip. Good, but strong. 

 I watched her put everything away, each item in its place. She rinsed out the mixer and opened her dishwasher, placing the mixer, shot glass, and lid in the top, working from the back left corner forward. 

 I was quiet, watching her, learning. 

 She giggled, taking a sip. "Strange, huh?" 

 "Hardly. I love watching you, seeing how you do things, trying to understand." 

 "You're weird," she laughed. 

 "Guilty. Scared you off yet?" 

 She smiled. "They like you." 

 "What's not to like? I'm pretty incredible you know," I laughed. 

 She moved toward me, her outfit pressing against my knees, as she leaned up for a kiss. I wasn't about to deny her. "I know," she said, afterward. 

 "I liked them too," I confessed. 

 "Good. You have fun tonight?" 

 "I did." 

 She took my hand in hers, pulling me along. "You don't have to leave soon, do you?" 

 "No. No other plans." 

 She opened a door, and pulled me into her immaculate bedroom. Every piece of furniture carefully placed, exactly centered against each wall. The top of her dresser bare, the bed-stand with only a clock-radio centered on it. The opposite bed-stand had a single lamp. The carpet showed parallel vacuum rows. 

 The bed was a double, with at least half-a-dozen pillows arranged artfully on it. 

 Briana turned her back to me, and removed her 'Kiss' hat, shaking out her hair. "I've got another kiss for you," she said softly. She reached up behind her neck, finding the white cloth pull strip. "Open it?" 

 I stood behind her, giving a tug. Pulling the cloth opened a velcro seal down the back. It opened all the way to the bottom, and she stepped out of it. She turned, and smiled shyly. 

 My heart almost stopped. Her breasts were each covered in a pyramid of foil, those teasing white pull strips sticking out at her nipples. Her panties were shiny metallic. She pulled her white pantyhose off, slowly, teasing. She leaned back on the bed, and her legs parted, showing another white strip down at her crotch. 

 I smiled. "Best friggin' costume ever," I said. 

 "You like? It was a lot of work." 

 "Worth every moment of it. Absolutely amazing." 

 She beckoned me forward with a crooked finger. "I love your outfit, too, but I think I'd like to see you without it." 

 I undressed for her, taking a couple of minutes to finish the job, removing those inside candy sacks, until I stood before her, naked except for a pair of boxers. 

 I climbed on the bed next to her, and took her in my arms. I kissed her, and she squirmed underneath me. "Unwrap your prize, handsome. You've earned it." 

 I leaned over her nearest "Kiss", examining the external package. It was twisted around her breast. I pulled the aluminum foil open and saw the inside was covered with a light silvery cloth, like her panties. I twisted it open, and the top of her breast appeared, her nipple hard. I leaned in for a quick taste. 

 "Do you like this brand?" she asked. 

 "More than anything," I admitted, sucking her nipple. 

 I pulled it completely opened, but the material stuck to her. "Gentle," she said softly. 

 I saw that she had taped down the inside around her breast. I carefully peeled it away, until she was completely exposed. I took her breast in my hand, cupping it, squeezing it softly. It was bigger than I had expected, even with the numerous flashes of cleavage I'd seen. 

 I toyed with my unexpected gift, feeling her wriggle and gasp. "The other, one," she said after a bit. "Please, open your other one." 

 I knew better what to expect, and opened it slowly, enjoying the gradual exposure. I peeled the foil back, exposing her breast completely, the foil a teasing corona around her perfect tit. I sucked and chewed on it, taking it in both hands, forming a cone, which I nibbled the top of. 

 She was tensing up, and I could feel the awkwardness. "What's wrong, beautiful?" 

 "The foil. Either put it on the other one, or take it off." 

 I understood. Uneven, I couldn't leave it uneven for too long. I peeled away the foil. I took the white cloth strip, and saw the carefully lettered "KISSES". I straightened it out and laid it across her belly. I rolled the foil into a neat ball, like she always did. I did the same with the other foil, which I'd originally just tossed to the side. With two pieces of cloth crossing her smooth stomach, I stood. "Garbage can?" I asked. 

 She smiled. "Behind the door." 

 I closed the door a little, and took the top off the garbage can. I ostentatiously deposited the two balls of foil inside, and closed the lid. She watched me, smiling. 

 "You are observant, aren't you?" she said. 

 "Especially when it comes to you. You're definitely worth watching." 

 She leaned back in the bed, stacking the pillows behind her head, three high. She parted her legs. "I've got one last KISS for you. Do I get to see you eat it?" 

 I climbed between her legs, and eased the shiny panties down her thighs. I lifted her legs, pulling them together, and slid the panties off the rest of the way. 

 I opened her legs up, brining my face down between them. She had another one of those white cloth strips coming out of her. I gave a gentle tug on it, and she moaned softly. "Open me, Zach." 

 I gave another tug, feeling a little resistance. She was wet, soaking, so that couldn't be the problem. I licked the top of her opening, teasing her, as I gave a series of little tugs. I was making progress, slowly. Another long slow tug, and she was moaning. 

 "All the way, Zach," she whispered. 

 It was stuck, and with a firm pull, I saw why. I saw the top of a large silver object, and had a good idea what it was. "Your KISS," she moaned, as I tugged on the cloth. 

 It was larger than I imagine could be comfortable. I tugged, and exposed half of it, but couldn't get it to move. I slid my finger inside of her, feeling the outline. It had to be close to two inches across. I reached under the edge of it, pulling it outward, tugging on the cloth strip, opening her. She moaned deeply, squirming, as the entire silver kiss was slowly exposed. It was almost free, spreading her wide. She whimpered softly, and it popped free, sliding out suddenly. 

 She gasped, moaning when I brought my mouth down and sucked on her. I licked inside of her, feeling her velvety smoothness. She smelled and tasted of chocolate. I couldn't get enough of her. I groaned. 

 "Chocolate Delight," she said softly. "Is it?" 

 "Is it what?" I asked. 

 "A chocolate delight. Is it?" 

 "God yes," I replied, going back down on her. 

 I lifted her legs up, her thighs over my shoulders, and licked her deeply before sucking on her chocolate flavored clit as if my life depended on it. She was trembling beautifully. 

 "Eat your special kiss, baby," she whispered, pulling my head down between her legs. 

 I teased her, feeling inside of her, exploring her warm chamber. "Up," she whispered softly. 

 I raised my head, and she reached down between her legs. I watched her insert a chocolate kiss inside of her. I reached inside of pussy, pulling it slowly out, holding it at her entrance with my finger, while I licked and sucked on it, feeling it melt and dissolve. When it was half gone, I sucked it out, tasting her juices. 

 I climbed up her body, pressing my lips against hers, my chocolate coated tongue piercing her lips. She sucked on my tongue, hard, pulling on it. 

 "My turn?" she whispered, smiling. 

 I nodded and she rolled me onto my back, climbing off the bed. "Take those off," she said, "and get in the middle, please." 

 I removed my boxers, and scooted over. She climbed between my legs, and I saw she had a bottle in her hand. She held it over my cock, and poured some of the contents on me. It was smooth and slippery. 

 "Chocolate lube," she teased, running her tongue around my cock, licking me, spreading the lube around uniformly. She sucked on the head. "Mmm, you taste amazing, Zach." 

 I chuckled. "You too, Bree." 

 I groaned when she wasted no time, taking me deep in her mouth, sucking strongly. She bobbed her head up and down, her hand playing with my balls, fondling them. "Jesus, that feels good," I told her. 

 She sat up smiling. "I want it to feel wonderful. I may be a pain in the ass most of the time, but if you can put up with me, I think you're going to find I'm worth it. I'm going to be the best damned girlfriend anyone's ever had." 

 She straddled my legs, rubbing against my cock. She held it against her pussy, grinding against it. She lifted her hips up, holding my cock upright underneath her. She rubbed the head against her lips, opening herself. "Am I your girlfriend, Zach?" 

 "For as long as you'll have me," I told her. "Best damned girlfriend in the world? I'll be damned if I'm going to let you get away." 

 "Ready to find out just one of the reasons I'll be the best girlfriend ever?" 

 I nodded, and groaned as she slid down my pole, ever so slowly, taking my entire length. "God, Zach, you feel so good inside of me." 

 "You feel incredible." 

 "Your three special kisses, yours whenever you want. As much as you want. My gift to you for as long as you'll take care of me." 

 "Take care of you?" I gasped, as she slid up and down my cock once, wiggling, taking it as deep as she could. 

 "Yes, take care of me. I need a strong man, and someone who understands me. Can you be that man, Zach. For me?" 

 I nodded. "I'd love to be that man for you." 

 She smiled, giving me another short ride up and down. "When things get stressful, I can be a handful. Sometimes I completely shut down, useless. You'll take care of me then, won't you? Take me somewhere safe, comfortable. Hold me until everything's livable again." 

 I pulled her down and hugged her. "I'll take care of you." 

 She chuckled, rolling her hips, rocking back against my hardness. "Then I'll take care of you. The very best I can." 

 She rose up, her hands on my chest, leaning over me. "Now be quiet, while I give you your gift." 

 I moaned as she positioned her feet at my sides, lifting her hips up and then bringing them down quickly, impaling herself. She grunted at the bottom, then lifted up and drove down again. She rode me hard, working at it, pounding away on my hard staff. I reached down and held her hips while I thrust against her. 

 Briana was breathing hard, fucking me. I watched her, enthralled. Her full breasts shaking with each thrust, her beautiful face a picture of concentration, her lips open, gasping for air. Her smooth legs open wide, giving me a clear view of her sexy pussy, as my hard cock disappeared inside of her. 

 "I'm going to come for you," I gasped. 

 "Thank you," she whispered, leaning down on top of me, lifting her ass up. I grabbed her hips, pounding up into her. Close, very close. 

 "Take it," she moaned sweetly. "It's yours, baby." 

 I hammered into her, as fast and hard as I could, groaning. "Fuck!" I gasped, pulling her down for my final release. 

 She whimpered sweetly, as I filled her sweet pussy, pushing into her deeply, releasing stream after stream deep inside. 

 I held her, breathing hard, reveling in the sensation of her naked body pressed against mine. 

 I felt her tense up after a minute or so of delightful repose. "That was amazing," I told her. "Everything Ok?" 

 She nodded. "Wonderful. But I need to clean up now, alright?" 

 "Of course." 

 She moved down my body, licking my chest. "You sure you don't mind?" 

 "Whatever you need, Bree." 

 She smiled, then scooted downward, until her mouth was over my crotch. She inched downward, peeking up at me, before she started licking the base of my cock, her tongue slowly moving upward, cleaning me. She sucked me briefly, taking all of my flaccid tool into her mouth, tugging on it, until it started to harden. 

 She took her time, meticulous, until I was as clean as possible. 

 "Better?" I asked. 

 She nodded. "Much. Not perfect, but better." 

 "What would make it perfect?" I asked. 

 She blushed. "I can't say, it's embarrassing." 

 I pulled her up onto me, getting a cute little squeal for the effort. "Spill, angel. Openness, remember? I need to know." 

 Her face was bright red, as she looked into my eyes. "I'm still dirty." 

 She looked nervous, the expression on my face probably not helping matters. She kissed me on the chin. "I'm sorry. I told you I was difficult. I can bathe." 

 In for a penny, in for a pound. "I'll take care of you," I told her. 

 She smiled, her face lighting up. "You don't mind?" 

 I gave her a twisted little grin. "Not something I ever imagined doing, but I'm willing, for you." 

 She sat up. "Wait." She rose up on her feet, squatting over my hips. She screwed up her face a moment, and I saw my juices leaking out of her. She gave it a few more seconds, then scrambled down the bed and licked me clean again. When she was finished, she smiled up at me. 

 She laid down on her back, opening her legs, her head hanging over the edge of the bed. She reached between her legs, and brought her hand back to her mouth. She licked her fingers and did it twice more. "Your turn," she said softly. 

 I moved in place, tentatively running my tongue through her pink groove. The taste wasn't terrible. Still a hint of the chocolate lube. I licked her carefully, and she moaned, gasping. "Clean me, Zach." 

 I sucked on her swollen nub, licking her, feeling her tense up. "Ok?" I asked. 

 "Wonderful," she moaned. "Don't stop." 

 Her legs were trembling delightfully. I licked her, until it was only her juices I could taste. She cried out for me, squeezing her legs around my head. I turned my head, biting down on her sensitive inner thigh, making her scream, her hips thrusting upward desperately. 

 I pulled her legs open, roughly, dragging her up onto the bed. She was gasping, moaning so sweetly. Absolutely irresistible. 

 I was hard again, between her oral ministrations, and her reaction to mine. I held her legs open and thrust into her, making her cry out. I pounded into her, desperate for the feel of her around my cock. 

 Briana pulled her legs back, opening herself. "Yours, always yours," she gasped, before throwing her head back and screaming, coming hard on my cock. 

 I rose up on my knees, pressing her legs back further, thrusting into her. She moaned, her body shaking. I thought I'd come quickly but I didn't feel the urge. Not yet. There was so much I wanted to do with her. To her. 

 I pulled out, grabbing her and flipping her over, lifting her hips. She pulled her knees underneath her, lifting her sweet ass. 

 "Cleaning time," I said, licking her from her swollen clit, up across her back door, probing her with my tongue. 

 She chuckled. "That's not for you. Not yet." 

 "Not yet?" 

 "I'm saving that for my husband." 

 "Good. It'll make it that more special when we do it." 

 "When WE do it?" she laughed.  

 

 

===

"Someday." I moved in behind her, thrusting into my third KISS, looking forward to the day she'd offer me the fourth one. But this one was more than enough for now. 

 She moaned, thrusting back against me. I grabbed her cute ass cheeks, holding them tightly while I long-stroked her, amazed at how wonderful it felt. I made her come for me twice more before I couldn't hold back any longer. 

 I didn't warn her. I pulled her back and jammed myself deep, erupting with a groan, hammering my release into her. She dropped her head to the bed, groaning. "Yes, yes," she whispered. 

 I pulled out and collapsed backward onto the bed. She turned around, smiling. "Bad boy. Now we have to clean up all over again." 

 I brushed her hair back, watching her lick and suck me clean. She scurried forward, squatting over me, and pushing out what she could of my latest gift, before turning around and licking me clean again. 

 I lifted her legs around my head, lowering her over my mouth into 69. I was less fastidious this time, not all that worried about a little taste of myself, not as disgusted as I thought I might be. She whimpered, spreading her legs wide, her weight resting against my mouth. "That's it," she moaned, trembling. 

 When she was happy, she turned around and laid down on top of me. She pressed her lips against mine, nibbling on my lips, rubbing her tongue against my teeth, exploring my mouth. She giggled, and crawled off of me, reaching into her bedside drawer. She returned quickly, climbing back on top of me. She sat up, and put her hand to my mouth. "Kissy lips," she said. 

 I puckered my lips for her, and she grinned. She opened her other hand and pulled out an M&M, placing it on my lips. "Hold it there." 

 I felt funny, my lips pushed forward, a light pink M&M, sitting on them. 

 "My secret stash." She leaned forward and sucked up the one on my lips. 

 "Not bad," she said. "I think we can do better. Sit up." 

 She scooted down to my thighs, and I sat up, facing her. She wiggled closer. "Tongue." 

 I grinned and opened my mouth, extending my tongue. She placed an M&M on it. 

 "Feed me, Zach." 

 I pulled my tongue in, leaning forward and pressing my lips against hers. I opened my mouth, my tongue still. She waited a moment, before her tongue entered my mouth, searching. She found her prize, and worked it forward, out of my mouth and into hers. 

 She pulled away with a smile. "Much better." She gave me a quick peck on the lips. "I have three of these each night, at bedtime. Will you feed them to me like that, Zach?" 

 "Every night?" 

 She nodded. "I can't get to sleep anymore, if I don't have all three." 

 I pulled her close, my arms around her waist. "I'd love to." 

 "Stay with me tonight?" she asked, softly, staring into my eyes. 

 "Will that be Ok? A stranger in your bed while you sleep." 

 She giggled. "First, I hope you're not a stranger. Second, we'll make it work somehow. We'll find what I'm comfortable with. It may take a while, and I might wake up terrified and screaming. You'll take care of me won't you?" 

 "Always. I promise." 

 "No argument then." She leaned over and placed one last M&M on the bedside, nudging it with her finger until she found the place that felt right to her. 

 "You don't want to finish it?" I asked, surprised. 

 "Of course, silly. But I eat the last one right before I go to sleep. I jill myself off, holding the others in my mouth until I come. I don't think I'll have to do that anymore." 

 "Maybe a few times more, I'd love to see that." 

 "You're a naughty boy, aren't you?" she teased. 

 "I guess so. I want to be very naughty with you." 

 She got up, heading into the bathroom. I heard her running the water in the tub. She returned to me a moment later. "Sorry. I don't know why I had to do that." 

 "It's Ok. Can I bathe with you?" 

 "You better. Someone's got to wash my back." 

 We cuddled, and talked about the trick-or-treating and her favorite costumes while the tub filled. We took a leisurely bath. I sat behind her, washing her, cuddling her, playing with her breasts, until she was comfortable. We dried off, and she gave me a toothbrush, so we could both freshen up. 

 "Change the sheets?" I asked. 

 "After." 

 "After?" 

 "One more time, if you don't mind." 

 "I don't mind." 

 It was beautiful. She brought me to hardness with her teasing mouth, and we made love, lying on top of her, thrusting inside of her for an eternity, slow and gentle. 

 She was getting antsy. She scrunched her face up. "God, not now," she moaned. 

 "What's wrong, Bree?" 

 She sighed. "Give me a minute?" 

 "Of course." 

 "I love what we're doing. I do. I swear, it's wonderful. It's not you." 

 "What?" 

 She wriggled out from under me, and ran out of the room. Shit. 

 She returned in a moment, obviously uncomfortable. Her hands were behind her back, and she was practically dancing in place. 

 "Come to bed," I urged her. 

 "It won't always be like this," she said nervously. 

 "What? Don't worry, whatever it is. I'll deal with it." 

 She shook her head. "I know it's weird. I'm going to freak you out." 

 I smiled. "No you won't. Come to me, and we'll work it out, I promise." 

 "You promise?" 

 "Cross my heart and hope to die." I crossed my heart with my left hand, my right keeping me ready to get back inside of her. 

 She brought her hands out from behind her back, shyly waving her cell phone. She climbed into the bed, adjusting the pillows fastidiously, then laying back into them. "Love me, Zach." 

 I kissed her softly, rubbing my cock between her legs, entering her gently. She nodded, anxious. "Deeper, and keep going, no matter what." 

 I leaned over her, pushing all the way in and long-stroked her. 

 She blushed, lifting the phone and entering a number. 

 "Mom? It's me," she said, sighing and sinking back into the pillows. Her legs relaxed, opening for me. 

 "Calm down, Mom. It's good. Everything's good. I promise." 

 "Stop it. You didn't ruin everything. Trust me Mom. It's wonderful." 

 "Yes, the costume was a hit. He loved it. All of it...Yes, that part especially." 

 "He's still here...Yes...Yes, in the bed with me...Inside of me if you really need to know." 

 Freaky. She was right. Beyond weird. 

 "Just a sec, Mom." She pulled the phone away from her ear. "Are you Ok? Is this too much?" she asked nervously. 

 "It's weird," I confessed. 

 She nodded. "I know. I'm so sorry. I...I had to call her." 

 I leaned down and kissed her softly. "Whatever you need, Bree. Whatever." 

 She smiled weakly, her eyes moist. "Thank you. I...if it's too much, I don't have to finish the call right now. She'll be alright now." 

 She had that nervous look again, her hand holding the phone trembling. 

 I reached down and gave her breasts a squeeze, then pushed my cock into her hard and deep, making her moan. "Go ahead. Finish your call. I think I can find something to keep me busy." 

 She grinned, lifting the phone, "One more sec, Mom. I swear." 

 She beckoned me down for a kiss, and I obeyed, letting her thank me. "You are the best, Zach. God, I can't believe how wonderful you are. I love you, baby." 

 She brought the phone to her ear. "I'm back. Sorry. I had to make sure everything's Ok." 

 She laughed, "Yes. And it's perfect. What do you think?" She lowered the phone, and held it down where I was connected to her. "Hard, Zach," she said. 

 I jackhammered her tight little hole, making her writhe beneath me. She whimpered sweetly. "Harder," she gasped. 

 I pushed her legs back, slamming into her, watching her tense up. The good tensing. She cried out, her body spasming underneath me. 

 She gasped, easing back into the sheets, and moaning sweetly. She closed her eyes, and brought the phone back to her ear. "Now do you believe me?" 

 She laughed, blowing me a kiss. "Number three. First two inside." 

 I enjoyed her, using her for my pleasure, while I listened to a blow-by-blow of her evening. She moved easily when I needed her to, rolling onto her side, even getting up on her knees for me. 

 She was grunting while I fucked her hard from behind, talking about our bath together. 

 "Uh-huh. Doggy. So good, Mom. I think he's going to make me come again." 

 "How many? I don't know. Tons. He presses all my buttons. Oh!" she gasped. "Mom, I'm close. So close, he has me on edge." She moaned, pushing back against me. "Not now, Mom. Gimme a sec." 

 She put the phone down, "My bottom, Zach. Tease it." 

 I laughed, sucking on my thumb before rubbing it against her pucker. She groaned, and cried out, coming hard, when I slid it inside her. 

 "God, Mom. That was a big one. Huge. Did you hear it?" 

 "Jesus, Mom! Was that Dad?" 

 "Fuck!" she groaned, trembling. She looked back at me. "Speaker-phone." 

 I slowed down, pushing deep, chuckling. What the fuck was I getting into to? 

 "Hi Dad...Yes, it's been a great evening...No, it's Ok, I just wasn't expecting it." 

 She turned to me. "Please don't stop, Zach." 

 "I need to slow down, or I'm going to come soon." 

 She nodded. "Ok. Let me now when you need to finish." 

 She turned back to the phone. "Mom, you still there?" 

 "Mmmhmm. Still doggy...You too?" 

 Fuck. 

 "No, he doesn't mind...A little freaked out of course, at first...If so, it doesn't show. Hard as steel, and ready to come soon." 

 "No...No Mom...That's too much." 

 She sighed, "Fine, I'll ask, Dad. I know, I know." 

 She looked back at me. "Mom wants to say hi. You don't have to." 

 I reached out and she handed me the phone, looking anxious. 

 "Zach?" 

 "Hi Angela. Timing's a little weird." 

 "Is it good? Is everything Ok?" she asked nervously. 

 "Wonderful. Not in any way normal, but that's Ok. She's worth it." 

 I heard her moan on the other end of the phone. "I'm sorry," she gasped. "I had to hear it from your lips. I'm so sorry. Don't be mad at her." 

 "It's Ok, Angie. I don't mind." 

 She moaned again. "Is it a little exciting? I'm getting off over here, getting it just like she is. I'm so fucking hot right now. Does it bother you to know your girlfriend's mother is a dirty little slut?" 

 "No, it doesn't bother me. And yes, it is exciting." I pulled the phone away from my head, scanning the screen. I pressed speaker-phone. 

 "Tell him, Brian. Tell him what I am." 

 Briana's father's voice came out loud and clear. "Damn it, Angie. I asked you to leave me out of it. The poor boy's going to freak for sure." 

 "Not yet, Brian." I said loudly. "You're on speaker." 

 I heard him chuckle. "Sorry about this. I tried to warn you. More than a handful. Both of them. High stress evening." 

 "Worth it though," I told him, lazily fucking his daughter. 

 "Tell him, Brian," Angela whined. 

 "She's a nasty little slut. Dirty little cum-bucket. Made me fuck her hard, while she listened to her naughty little daughter. By the way, anytime you want to change position, I'm up for it. Old knees." 

 I laughed. "Cowgirl." 

 "Giddy-up," he chuckled. 

 I pulled out lying on my back, scooting into the center of the bed when Briana gave me a nudge. 

 "You there, son?" I heard Brian ask. 

 "Almost. Got to be positioned just right, you know." 

 "Don't I know it. Dead center, two pillows." 

 "Two pillows? She hasn't bothered me about that. Oh, shit that's good," I moaned as Briana settled over my cock. 

 "Fuck his brains out," Angela said. "Like this." 

 I almost laughed, when I heard Brian's moan. Almost, until Briana started riding me hard. 

 "Like this, Momma?" Briana asked. 

 "That's it baby. Show him. Show him you're worth it. Worth all of this." 

 "So worth it," I groaned. 

 "Good, Zach?" her mother gasped. 

 "Great." 

 "Can you come for her? Come for us? I need it, baby," Angela moaned. 

 "Soon, I'm close. Really close." 

 "You too, Dad?" Briana managed to ask, somehow. 

 "Yes, angel. Your Mom has me on edge." 

 Briana looked at me. "Come for me Zach. Let me know when you're going to come." 

 "Just...a little...more," I gasped, thrusting upward. 

 "That's it Zach. You're going to make us both come," Angela moaned. 

 "Now!" I gasped, reaching for her. In one fast move she bounced off of me, taking me in her mouth, her head bobbing fast. 

 "FUCK!" I grunted, "Take it," I growled, exploding in her mouth. I hear an echo of my own groan on the other end of the phone, and Angela screamed out her daughter's name. 

 I looked down and Briana had stopped moving, her hands between her legs, as her entire body shook. I thrust my cock between her lips, making her gag, as I finished coming. 

 I groaned, twitching as her mouth resumed its sucking, draining me. 

 "Did you make it, honey?" Angela asked. 

 Briana lifted her head, licking her lips. "Big time, Mom. With his cock in my mouth. You?" 

 "Amazing, sweetie. Thank you for calling. We were so nervous for you." 

 She was licking my cock, teasingly. She climbed up my body, picking up the phone from beside us, where it had fallen. "I know, Mom. It's why I called. I could tell." 

 "I'm sorry, honey. I tried to be good and patient." 

 "It's Ok, Mom. It worked out. I don't think Zach minded at all. Did you Zach?" 

 "No. I didn't mind. Whatever you need. I promised, didn't I?" 

 She nodded, crawling up my body, and lying atop me, getting comfortable. "Some boys don't keep their promises. It's going to be difficult sometimes." 

 "But always worth it," Brian called out. 

 "I bet. Sounds like you've got a handful over there," I teased. 

 "No shit. Hottest pussy in three states. I hope yours is half as good." 

 "Dad!" Briana whined. 

 "Unbelievable. I didn't know it could be like this," I confessed. 

 Briana gave me a quick kiss. "We're going to go now, Ok Mom?" 

 "Alright. I'm fine now." She giggled. "More than fine. I really am sorry, baby. I didn't want to interfere." 

 "You can interfere whenever you need to Angela. A little phone call isn't going to scare me away." 

 "Goodnight, Zach. Night baby. Treat him good. He's a keeper," Brian said. 

 "I will Dad. I'm lucky. I know a good man when I see one. I've had a great example," Briana said. "G'night, Mom." 

 "Goodnight Bree," Angela said. "You too Zach. I can't thank you enough. I owe you one. A big one. I always pay my debts." 

 "Enough, Angela. No teasing. Leave the boy alone. It's his first night with her, damn it." 

 "Yes, dear. You're right. But you know I pay my debts. Always." 

 "Goodnight kids," Brian said. "I'm hanging up now." 

 Briana took the phone, turned it off and put it beside the bed. "Change the sheets," she said, climbing off me. 

 I pulled off the old ones while she got the new set. She had to make the bed completely, including putting the pillows back in place, before she was happy. She stepped back, looking at the bed, smiling. "It looks so neat and innocent." 

 I nodded. "Hard to tell I spent the greatest evening of my life in it." 

 "Was it? The greatest? Not too weird?" she asked anxiously, walking to me and taking me by the hand. She drew me toward the bathroom. 

 "Best ever. Very weird, but I'm not complaining. Even good." 

 She laughed. "Sorry about Mom. She gets like that." 

 "You seemed like you knew she was bothered." 

 "I always know. Don't know why. That's part of our problem. I know when she's stressed out, and she knows when I'm all tied up in knots. It doesn't make this any easier." 

 She gave my hips a nudge with hers, laying a nice even line of toothpaste on her brush before passing it to me. We brushed our teeth together, sharing the sink. She poured a half-inch of mouthwash into a dixie cup and passed it to me, before getting one herself. I gargled, and rinsed. I moved behind her, giving her a hug. 

 Briana took a brush, and gave her hair a quick pass. "Presentable?" 

 I laughed. "Gorgeous." 

 She gave me a quick kiss, which evolved into something more. I lifted her into my arms, and she laughed, hugging me. "I'm yours, handsome. Take me to bed, or lose me forever." 

 We climbed into bed, and cuddled. She was half asleep when she bolted upright. She scrambled to the side, and returned with an M&M. "Feed me?" 

 I curled my tongue, and put it in the middle, then slid it into her mouth. She sucked on it gently, dragging her teeth across it, recovering her precious M&M. She settled right down afterward, cuddling up to me in a lover's embrace, her head on my shoulder, her leg draped over mine. I reached down and fondled her sweet ass. 

 "Me too," she said softly. 

 "Me too, what?" 

 "Best night ever. You know it's only going to get better." 

 "I don't know how." 

 She chuckled. "That's my job. You'll take care of me, right?" 

 "Always." 

 "Thank you. I love you, Zach. I know it's too early to say it, but I have too, you understand? I love you. I hope that doesn't scare you away," she said anxiously, clinging to me. 

 "No. It doesn't scare me at all. I love you too." 

 She relaxed, kissing my chest. "You can take me in the night if you want. It would be nice if you finished in my mouth, though." 

 "You'd want that?" I asked, surprised. 

 "The loving or the mouth?" 

 "Either." 

 "Of course. You can make love to me anytime you want. I'm yours now, Zach. Heart, body and soul." 

 "And the mouth?" 

 "Less cleaning. I like the cleaning, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to change the sheets in the middle of the night." 

 "I'm probably going to take you up on that." 

 "Good." 

 She drifted off in my arms, and I kissed the top of her head. Weird. No two ways about it. 

 She woke twice in the night, all worked up, and I settled her down each time, holding her, caressing her. I woke up on my own at one point, her cushiony bottom pressed against me. I had an erection, and desperately wanted to put it to use, but I was worried about her reaction, in spite of her words. Not worried enough to stop me from opening her legs and taking her from behind. She moaned sweetly, while I used her, surprised at how quickly I was reaching my point of no return. When I was at my limit, I climbed over her, and up the bed. Her eyes were closed but she smiled and opened her mouth. I slid my cock between her lips stroking myself. She sucked gently, until I came for her. She took it all gamely, sucking me dry. I let her suck me longer than I needed, watching her, enthralled. 

 When I pulled out, she pouted. "A little more," she whispered. 

 I eased my cock back into her mouth, a little uncomfortable holding the position. She suckled easily, slowly, until her breathing changed and her mouth relaxed, holding me. I brushed her hair back, and extracted myself from her lax mouth. She was asleep again. 

 I climbed behind her, pulling her close, spooning her. 

 Amazing night. I fondled her soft naked body, feeling her press back against me in her sleep. 

 Three days without kisses and one kidnapped M&M, three weeks ago. That was all it took. I owed Red a big thank you.
