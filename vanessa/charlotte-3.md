Charlotte

Charlotte sensed someone was in the room with her. Despite the blindfold she turned her face towards the presence; her fingers clamped around the arms of the chair. Charlotte's nostrils flared, her sense of smell heightened from fear and the inability to see. The perfume told her it wasn't Peter, the scent was definitely not his, it was a more feminine smell. Charlotte recognised it - - but where from? The answer was close ... a hazy image formed in her mind but refused to materialise. She felt a waft of breath against her cheek and tried to rise from the chair, an impossible task since her wrists were bound to the wooden arms. 

A voice came from across the room; the Polish accent confirmed it was Peter: So he was there too! 

"Do you trust me?" 

Charlotte felt fingers trace a feather-soft line down her cheek. The stranger was touching her. She swallowed heavily but nodded in the face of her fear. 

"Good," Peter murmured. "You can leave whenever you want." He spoke a single word and explained: "Say that word at any time ..." Peter paused and emphasised, "Any time at all, and it will stop ... Immediately." Another pause before he continued. "But," Peter said, his accent thickened by anticipation, "if you do leave, it's over; completely gone ...Finished." 

The man fell silent, but Charlotte knew he was still with her; she could hear his breathing. His words comforted her even though there was a third party in that room. It was a woman, Charlotte was certain. She put aside the niggling frustration of the perfume and thought quickly. The effects of the wine were wearing off and she had a decision to make. Was she prepared to be controlled? To submit to the will of Peter and whoever else was with them? The offer by Peter of an escape route reassured her, and Charlotte recognised the finality of the situation should she balk and run. Did she really want what was on offer? 

The woman considered her situation. She thought of the emails she'd discovered -- the filthy exchange between Peter, a supplier of fabrics to her factory, and her PA, Vanessa. The written exchanges had, at first, disgusted Charlotte, but there'd been a frisson to her discovery. Despite her offended morality, Charlotte had experienced a rush of warmth between her legs, and, red-faced with mortification, she found herself locking her office door and rubbing herself to orgasm as she imagined herself in the scenes described. 

Charlotte confronted Peter about the lewd communications between himself and Vanessa -- a strange course of action given the fact that Vanessa was an employee, but Charlotte didn't reconcile her actions on a logical level; she was driven by a more primordial force. 

The heat in her cunt. 

They met in an expensive London eatery as arranged. Peter, tall, broad- shouldered, and with his rough, interesting face betraying his concern, complimented Charlotte in her long, black dress. Charlotte knew she looked good, understated but elegant, with a simple string of pearls around her neck. She'd chosen her dress and shoes deliberately. Her ash-blonde bob was newly cut and feathered around her face prettily. She noticed Peter's eyes flicker towards her deep cleavage and she smiled to herself -- Big tits, she thought, gets them every time. 

Ignoring the polite murmur of muted conversations around them, Peter brought the subject in hand immediately to the fore. Lifting his hungry stare from the upper slopes of Charlotte's round breasts, Peter fixed his grey-blue eyes on her face. "I'm surprised," Peter said after a waiter had poured wine and left. "You find such emails between me and Vanessa, yet you speak to me and not her ... Why?" 

"I can deal with Vanessa any time," Charlotte responded in her typically haughty fashion -- a self-made woman, she was used to having her own way. She shrugged, a movement that caused her breasts to jiggle, and Charlotte saw Peter glance at her chest again. "She's an employee, I can replace her, but you, Peter, are much more important to me." 

The man's lips pursed and he shook his head. He ran his hand over his close- cropped hair. "No, Charlotte," he said emphatically. "I don't accept that. You could just fire Vanessa and not say anything to me. She's at fault, you're her employer ..." Peter paused, he stared intently at Charlotte -- it was a stare that caused the mature woman's sex to clench. Charlotte reached for her glass and gulped at her wine to cover her discomfit. Peter smirked, Charlotte's reaction spoke volumes. "There's more to it," he continued. He studied Charlotte's face. "Tell me," he insisted. 

Peter used silence as a weapon. It was a trick he'd been taught years ago by his father. "They'll grow uncomfortable," the old man had said. "You control the silence and they will try to fill it. A useful trick in negotiations," Pappy had said and smiled. 

"OK," Charlotte blurted finally. Peter smiled to himself. It had worked. "At first I was ... disgusted by what I read. The things you wrote to each other ... I've never ..." 

"It's role-play, Charlotte," Peter interrupted. "A game." He sipped at his wine and glanced around the room. Nobody was paying any attention to the couple. They were an innocuous sight. Well-dressed, obviously wealthy -- they could even be married. "You said you were disgusted. What changed? How come you're not so offended anymore?" 

Peter used the silence again. 

"I—" Charlotte began. 

"—were turned on," Peter finished for her. His voice fell to a whisper: "You grew excited." The man leaned across the table, he held Charlotte's gaze: "You played with yourself, Charlotte. You used your hands on yourself ... down there." Peter nodded towards Charlotte's lap. 

The woman blushed and looked away. He was right; Peter had known exactly what she'd done. "It wasn't like that," Charlotte blustered. Her usual, assured demeanour evaporated. The man could read her like a book. Damn him, damn his intriguing eyes and his harsh good-looks. An image flashed into her mind. She saw Peter above her as she lay supine, with her legs wide apart, as she offered herself to him. Charlotte blushed at the vivid picture; she saw Peter's assured smirk as he held himself above her submissive form, she felt her nipples tighten as, in her mind, his big cock nudged her opening ... Charlotte squirmed against her seat. A pulse throbbed between her legs. 

"It was exactly like that, Charlotte." Peter's accented English brought her back to the present. The residue of her fantasy lingered; her breasts ached and her teats longed to be sucked by this man -- Charlotte's insides melted. 

Forty-five minutes later and Charlotte found herself in a black cab with Peter. She heard Peter speak to the driver -- she recognised the address from somewhere, but lust and wine blurred her senses. Besides, as soon as the cab turned a sharp one-hundred-and-eighty towards their destination, Peter fell on Charlotte like a predatory beast. 

His hands were on her thighs instantly. Charlotte, feeling his fingers travel down her limbs, allowed her legs to fall apart. Peter growled as his hand slid up under the hem of the dress. He pushed roughly at Charlotte's thighs, eager to get to the hot place at their junction. Charlotte shuffled forward to accommodate Peter's insistent probe; she pushed her legs wider apart, and, at the same time, saw the driver observing the goings-on in his mirror. Aroused by the voyeuristic intent of the cabbie, Charlotte stared back at him belligerently -- as though challenging him. 

Fuck you, she thought. Watch all you like, I don't give a damn. She groaned as Peter's palm cupped her mound through the fragile material of her underwear. She pushed back against the pressure while Peter moved across her body to kiss her. 

Charlotte returned the kiss. Her lipstick, so carefully repaired following the meal, smeared across her face. Her hair also fell into disarray, smudged against the seat while Peter's tongue explored the wet cavern of her open mouth. 

"You want to do this." Peter murmured during a break in their frenzied kissing. "We agreed." 

"Absolutely," Charlotte acquiesced. "You've never cheated me so far ... in business ... why should this be any different?" She gasped as Peter's finger pushed beyond the taut film of her underwear and found the oily gape of her opening. 

"You must trust me," Peter breathed into her ear. "It will be strange, but you must trust me." 

Charlotte groaned and looked at the mirror again. The man was watching as Peter fingered her hole. The situation was already strange to Charlotte. A divorcee and 42 years old, she was used to straight sex behind closed doors. Sprawled in the back of a cab with the driver ogling her gaping snatch was just not her style. A modern day ladette would be more inclined to such lewd behaviour, but Charlotte, having conquered her modest upbringing, considered herself more refined. She moaned, turned on enough to agree to anything: "I do," she panted. "I trust you ... I ... I ...." 

Peter grinned into the shadowy interior of the cab. Charlotte couldn't see his expression; her attention was on the cabby's eyes and the flame between her legs. Things were going better than he'd anticipated. He was pleased he'd made the call ahead when the opportunity arose. Charlotte's make-up repairs had given him the chance to use his mobile phone. His cock, already stiff, throbbed at what was to come. 

The taxi driver accepted the fare and tip and, with a smirk, drove away. As the cab's engine noise dwindled, Peter led Charlotte up a short flight of steps towards the impassive façade of an expensive London mews. 

With some trepidation Charlotte allowed herself to be blindfolded and bound to the chair by her wrists. 

And now she had to make her choice. 

Decisive in business, and, once a decision was made, she stuck to it. Charlotte opted to stay. "I trust you, Peter," she said determinedly. "I want to do this." 

"Excellent," a female voice whispered in Charlotte's ear. The accent was quintessentially English; the speaker was well-educated, the product of indulgent parents and a girls' private school. Charlotte recognised the voice of Vanessa, her PA. 

"You!" Charlotte blurted. "The address, your perfume ... I should've known sooner—" 

Fingers dug into Charlotte's cheeks. The woman hissed: "You don't talk. Nobody gives a fuck what you think. You're here for my pleasure." 

A thrill of fear surged through Charlotte. Her guts clamped at the venom in the woman's tone. She thought of the safe word and nearly called it out. Then, as the code was about to form in her mouth, she recalled Peter's repeated insistence on trust. She swallowed heavily, still frightened, but now a thread of lust ran through the dark fabric of her fear. 

Charlotte surrendered her will. 

"Do it to her," Charlotte heard the woman say. A sound told Charlotte that Peter was moving to obey the command. So Peter wasn't in charge; he was in the woman's power as well. Charlotte had no further time to ponder since she felt hands grasp her ankles. 

"Put your legs over the chair arms," Peter said. 

He guided the woman's limbs into position. It was uncomfortable but not intolerable. Charlotte sat there with her backside on the edge of the cushioned seat, with her wrists bound and the backs of her knees hooked over her forearms. In this position, Peter lifted two handfuls of her dress and pushed the material up around Charlotte's belly. The woman felt fingers against her body as Peter wrenched the lacy scrap of her underwear to one side. A rending sound told Charlotte that her knickers were now a rag. 

Peter uttered a Polish obscenity. Vanessa laughed. 

"Looks like the bitch is all hot for your tongue, Peter. Her cunt's swollen and red and bubbling with juice." Charlotte's face burned beneath her blindfold, but Vanessa's vulgar description sent a surge of lust through her body. "You may kiss her there," Vanessa allowed. 

Charlotte felt hot breath on her sex as Peter manoeuvred himself into position. Her labia were spread, with Peter's thumbs Charlotte imagined, and then she groaned when the man's mouth touched her burning sex. 

"Oh ... fuck ..." Charlotte grunted and immediately fell silent as Vanessa's fingers dug into her cheeks again. 

"Not a word from you, cunt. You say another word and I'll take this big-cocked bastard away from you. Then you can sit there with your twat unfucked. " 

Charlotte whined but made no articulate sound. 

A few minutes passed. The only sounds in the room were the slurping of Peter's mouth and tongue against the slippery flesh of Charlotte's core, and the muted moans and whimpers from her mouth. 

Peter worked two fingers inside Charlotte and curled them to rub at the sensitive place inside. He rubbed hard at the rough spot he felt there, and was rewarded by a great burst of delight from Charlotte. The woman groaned even louder as Peter dabbed his tongue at her excited clitoris. 

Vanessa's insistent voice broke across Charlotte's thoughts: "Don't let her come! If she comes you don't get your reward." 

Immediately Charlotte felt Peter's fingers slide out of her opening. His tongue formed lazy patterns around her labia rather than the hard pressure against her clit that she'd adored. She wriggled in an effort to urge Peter to return to his earlier ardour. 

But it was not to be. "It's time for the collar," Vanessa commanded. "Untie her, take the blindfold off and strip her." 

A ripple of unease caused Charlotte to shiver for a second. Strip her? Naked? She was unprepared for this. Her body wasn't what it had been as a young woman. She was aware of her curves and felt self-conscious at being nude in front of these people. 

Caught on the horns of a dilemma, Charlotte called to mind the safe-word again. She dithered, and before she'd managed to form a protest she felt the cords around her wrists slacken. She flexed her fingers and became aware of the ache in her forearms. Charlotte had been straining against the bonds without realising it as Peter had licked her. The discomfort momentarily displaced the anxiety she felt at being stripped bare. 

The blindfold was removed and Charlotte blinked. She looked around the room. The place was sparsely furnished, but what furniture there was, was obviously expensive. Charlotte saw her employee, Vanessa. The woman stared at Charlotte with a supercilious expression on her face -- an arrogant sneer. Charlotte was cowed by the intense, green-eyed gaze and she hurriedly turned her face away to observe Peter. Charlotte gasped when she saw him. He was naked. Peter held what appeared to be a short, leather belt and a chain in one hand; in the other were what were obviously cuffs. It wasn't the sight of the paraphernalia that caused Charlotte's shock, nor was it Peter's heavy-muscled body -- it was the girth of his penis that made her gasp. 

The great thing just ... hung there; a malicious entity, thick and threatening. 

"Fucking huge isn't it?" Vanessa said; her eyes gleamed. "You're going to suck that thing. He's going to stick that monster into your mouth and down your throat ... And you're going to love it." 

The prospect of taking Peter orally frightened Charlotte. It would be impossible to put that ... awful penis into her mouth; she would choke on it! Then, as Peter came towards her, his brutal cock swinging as he walked, Charlotte experienced a surge of elation. She was so aroused; she needed to come, her climax was imperative, and she'd do ... anything to get it. 

"Take off your dress," Vanessa barked. Charlotte's face grew scarlet with embarrassment as she unhooked the eye at the nape of her neck and unzipped the dress. She shuddered and closed her eyes when the garment slid over her body, but she accepted the humiliation gladly if it meant that she was a step closer to orgasm. "Take off your bra, slut!" Charlotte jumped, startled out of her reverie. She hesitated, but then complied. Peter murmured softly in his native tongue when he saw Charlotte's full, heavy breasts swing free. "Put the collar on her. Cuff her wrists!" Peter obeyed instantly. He indicated the string of pearls around Charlotte's neck. Soon after the jewellery was coiled atop Charlotte's discarded dress. "Touch her breasts, Peter. Squeeze them. Suck her nipples." 

Charlotte opened her eyes when Peter's hands closed around her body. The collar felt strange around her neck, so much tighter than the pearls had been, and the chain felt cold as it hung between her breasts, its leather loop hanging just in front of her navel. She gasped again when she saw Peter's cock jerking and stiffening of its own accord. It couldn't possibly grow any bigger! But Charlotte saw it could. 

Peter nuzzled and suckled Charlotte's nipples. He sucked one teat between his teeth and then did the same to its twin. The flesh thickened and grew while the dark saucers of Charlotte's areolae contracted as her excitement heightened. All thoughts of her slight belly and bare bottom were banished as the fire between her legs raged on. 

Vanessa stared at the pair with a hungry expression on her face and a glint of desire in her green eyes. She lifted her tight skirt to her waist, and, being naked beneath, split the folds of her labia with her middle finger. She sighed when her fingers slid over the slick nub of her own engorged clitoris. She tottered momentarily; her own desire and the spiked heels of her mirror-shiny, black shoes nearly caused her to fall. She recovered her balance and allowed herself a few seconds more of self-indulgence before she strode across to Charlotte and Peter. She ordered Peter to cease and then hooked the leather loop between Charlotte's breasts with her fingers. 

Charlotte experienced a fresh burst of fear as she was yanked across the room to a leather chesterfield sofa. The tattered remnant of her knickers slid down her shin and fell to the carpet. Vanessa wrapped several loops of the chain around her fist until Charlotte was on a short leash, and then, with a look of disdain, Vanessa manoeuvred the blonde to her liking. She shoved disdainfully at Charlotte's shoulder; Charlotte fell into the cool embrace of the settee. 

Vanessa released the chain as Charlotte fell backwards. "Julian," she called. 

A tall man entered the room. Charlotte estimated his age at late-twenties and immediately saw a resemblance between the newcomer and Vanessa. Their hair colour was identical; blue-black, but rather than the straight length of Vanessa's, the man's hair was a mass of loose curls. They shared the same angular cheekbones and deep, green eyes. One noticeable difference was their attitude. The man, Julian, Vanessa's brother, didn't share his sister's arrogance; he appeared hesitant -- as though this situation was relatively new to him as well. 

Julian, too, was naked. He had the lean build of a cross-country runner. His legs were long, with strong, well-muscled thighs. His arms were thinner than Peter's but well defined. Julian's cock stood at an undecided half-mast, and, although decently proportioned, wasn't in the same, terrifying league as Peter's. 

Julian eyed the pretty, voluptuous blonde on the settee. Her make-up was a mess, and her hair in disarray. She was older than he by at least ten years, but Julian found her attractive. She was desirable. His cock stiffened a little more at the perversity of the scene his sister had engineered. 

"Give her your cock to suck, Julian," Vanessa ordered. She turned to Peter: "You go over there too. You're going to share that hard-on with the slut." 

Charlotte's stomach lurched when she heard Vanessa's orders. A thrill of the taboo shocked her. Did Vanessa really mean for Peter to suck this man's cock? It wasn't that she objected to having Julian in her mouth -- his cock looked divine -- it was the perversity of sharing it with a man.  

===

She soon found out. 

Julian offered his penis to Charlotte. The blonde wriggled forwards on the sofa and leaned towards the proffered erection. Her hands, although cuffed at the wrists by wide leather bracelets, held close together with a few links of stout chain, could still be used. She opened her mouth and, with a glance at Vanessa, popped the purple dome between her lips. Julian sighed and pushed his fingers through Charlotte's hair. 

Charlotte warmed to her task. She decided to make a good show of sucking cock in front of Vanessa. Having reconciled herself to her situation and, as a result, recovering some of her confidence, Charlotte felt her competitive edge returning. She slurped at Julian's cock with exaggerated vigour, spitting onto the helmet and rubbing a smear of saliva and Julian's goo around her cheeks. 

It was to be a short-lived experience. Vanessa, with typical assured arrogance, took command. "Peter!" she barked. "On your knees. Show the useless bitch how it's done." 

Charlotte's eyes widened in shock as Peter moved alongside her legs. He pulled Julian's erection to his mouth and took the entire length in one go. The blonde looked up at Julian. The man had a strange expression on his face, as though he wasn't quite sure if he was comfortable with this. Nevertheless, he made no move to stop the Polish man from deep-throating his penis. 

Peter gagged and Julian's length slid from his mouth. Long strands of drool hung from the end of the thing, and the shaft glistened with saliva. Peter immediately licked Julian's penis from tip to balls. He was emitting tiny mewls of pleasure as he tongue slid up and down the other man's dick. Then, as he slowly caressed his own, impressive organ, Peter moved his lips over the mushroom head and swallowed the length once again. 

Charlotte was shocked. She was disgusted and filled with lust at the same time. How could he do it? How could the man she knew in the business world be this man here? Peter was obviously enjoying what he was doing. And it was obviously something he'd done before -- many times. 

"Now you do it." The order came. Peter, with some reluctance, offered Julian's cock to Charlotte. He held the blonde woman's gaze for a moment. Charlotte hesitated. Instantly, Vanessa was upon her. This time, rather than taking hold of the chain, Vanessa took a handful of Charlotte's hair in a tight fist. Charlotte gasped with pain and shock. Then, before she could even think of using the code, she found Julian's cock-head against her mouth. 

She opened her lips and he was inside her. Coughing and gagging, Charlotte was forced to endure a brief agony. She couldn't breathe, her eyes streamed with tears in reaction to her gag reflex as she tried in vain to cough the invading meat out of her throat. She gasped and spluttered as Vanessa pulled her head back and the cock slid free. 

"No ..." she managed to gurgle. "I—" 

"Use the word, you cunt," Vanessa snarled. "Go on, use it. I want to break you, you stuck-up bitch. Use the fucking word." 

Charlotte's lips formed the first syllable. This was too far. This wasn't fun. With her eyes still streaming she turned to face the domme. Their eyes met. Vanessa's cold look of contempt stopped Charlotte from using the get-out. Anger surged through her. The young woman thought she'd won. Charlotte could see the triumph on the girl's face. "Fuck you," she snapped. 

"You. Don't. Speak." Vanessa grabbed the chain and pulled hard. Her face went close to Charlotte's. "You speak only to use the word ... Otherwise ..." Her eyes bored into Charlotte's. "...You do as I tell you." 

Time hung. The scene played out over three heartbeats. Julian stared at his sister; he wasn't experienced enough to understand what was going on. 

Peter immediately grasped the situation - a power struggle. He thought that Charlotte would crumble. Vanessa was too used to this, Charlotte was fresh to it. 

If he were a betting man ... he would have lost. 

Charlotte glared back at the devil-woman. She panted and her eyes still watered. There was drool spattered on her breasts, but, she rationalised, if she surrendered -- if she ran away, then Vanessa would win. The only way she could walk away with any pride, was in paradoxical submission. 

Charlotte lowered her gaze. 

"His cock next." Vanessa gestured towards Peter. 

Peter grinned and stroked his flagging cock back to stiffness. He grabbed Charlotte's hair -- not as harshly as Vanessa, but hard enough for Charlotte to yelp. He swung the woman's head so she was facing him, and he noticed with a thrill of delight that her heavy breasts jiggled and swayed. He was going to enjoy this. He'd always desired Charlotte. He would have made a play for her sooner if he'd known she'd be so malleable. 

"Fuck her mouth, Peter," Vanessa urged. "Teach the bitch a lesson -- Choke her with that thing." 

Charlotte opened her mouth as wide as she could manage. Peter introduced the dreadful, blunt end to her lips. He pushed his cock at her and used his other hand to hold her head still. The woman struggled to accommodate the girth. Her jaw began to ache -- it was impossible. Then, the ridged head moved into her mouth; Charlotte felt the thing on her tongue. More meat slid between her stretched lips. Charlotte snorted breath through her nose desperately. She wriggled on the leather seat. 

"Hold her cuffs, Julian," Vanessa commanded. "Make sure she can't use her hands." 

Julian looked at his sister. He'd been staring in morbid fascination at Charlotte's face. The woman looked like a snake swallowing a goat. Her mouth couldn't possibly be stretching to take Peter's huge cock ... But it was. "What?" he blurted. 

"Her hands, you idiot! Hold her hands still." 

Peter pushed a couple more inches into Charlotte's mouth. Then, when he judged she was on the edge, he pulled out. 

Charlotte gagged and coughed. A great drool of saliva gushed down her chin; a thread of the stuff connected her to Peter's cock -- an obscene strand that swung heavily between them until it finally snapped. Charlotte coughed again uncontrollably, and, at the same time, tried to take great lungfuls of sweet air. Nevertheless, despite her suffering, Charlotte was thrilled to notice the tide mark on Peter's shaft that marked the point at which she'd accommodated him. 

She could do this! She began to grow aroused again. The flaming desire inside her had cooled since she'd fellated Julian in a more traditional fashion. Now, the itching burn between her legs was rekindled. 

Unknowingly, Vanessa played into Charlotte's hands. "Fuck her now, Peter. Stretch her cunt. Turn her inside out while Julian fucks her mouth." 

Vanessa had shrugged off the dark suit jacket and had unbuttoned the plain, white blouse she'd worn underneath. Her skirt was still hiked up around her hips; she was dying to rub herself, but she denied herself the pleasure. The slut could lick her later. Vanessa smirked at the thought of her employer licking her twat. 

Peter pushed Charlotte into a reclining position on the sofa. To his surprise the woman willingly opened her legs. He looked down and saw the reason for her eagerness. Her sex was gaping. Charlotte's labia hung heavy and pouting. There was a smear against the leather where Charlotte's lust had dribbled from her body. Peter growled, lifted Charlotte's manacled wrists above her head, and butted the head of his cock against her opening. He pushed, there was a slight resistance at first, but then, to his surprise, he slid inside her body. 

Vanessa watched, wide-eyed and expectant when Peter knelt between Charlotte's thighs. She anticipated a squeal of reluctance -- which never came. Instead, she saw Peter's girth stretch Charlotte open, but was surprised by the ease in which the blonde accommodated the thick cock. 

Peter's balls slapped against Charlotte's body. She smiled in triumph. The thing felt huge inside her, it was easily the largest she'd ever taken, but she was so aroused, so wet ... Her body had opened up and accepted the invader. Charlotte began to move her hips. 

Vanessa changed her mind about her brother's role. The idiot was just gawping anyway. She clambered onto the settee and settled herself above Charlotte's face. The bitch had her eyes closed. And she was even smiling! She was enjoying herself. Fuck! "Lick me, bitch," Vanessa ordered. "Suck my cunt." 

Charlotte obeyed instantly. 

"You slut," Vanessa crowed. "You're fucking that big cock and licking my twat. What a whore!" Vanessa forced her gooey opening against Charlotte's mouth. Lust trickled from the black-haired woman's body as she slid her clitoris over the end of Charlotte's nose. 

Charlotte, aroused to a fever pitch by the torrent of obscenity that poured from Vanessa's mouth, not to mention being stretched to bursting by Peter's cock, actually felt her climax begin to bubble. 

Julian stood by and watched. He stroked his cock as his eyes flicked from the sight of Peter's dick which, on the outstroke, seemed to be about to turn Charlotte's vagina inside out. The purple skin was so taut and unyielding it bulged around the circumference of Peter's shaft. He saw his sister's face twisted in a rictus of lust as she ground her pubis against the blonde's mouth. Charlotte seemed to be coping well enough with this double onslaught, and Julian groaned at the sight of the woman's heavy breasts as they jiggled and wobbled to Peter's urgent, stabbing thrusts. 

In the midst of her pleasure, Vanessa happened to glance at Peter. She saw by his face that he was close to coming. "No!" she called. "Don't Peter. Don't you come in that bitch." She lunged for the man. 

Charlotte lay panting on the settee. Vanessa had managed to haul Peter off her before he came. Unfortunately for Charlotte, she too had still to reach her peak. She'd been so close too. She reached her hands between her legs. Her fingers found her sodden hole. 

Vanessa heard the metallic clicking of the short linkage of Charlotte's manacles. "Oh no you don't!" she called and turned to her brother who was still yanking his stiff cock. "Hold her hands away from her cunt. Stop her playing with herself." 

"Fuck me," Charlotte whispered as Julian yanked at her cuffs. "Put your cock in there. Fuck me. I want you to do it." 

Julian gulped and stole a glance at his sister. She was occupied with some kind of belt; Vanessa was fastening some contraption to herself. He turned back to Charlotte. He groaned at the sight of her, wanton and desirable as she lay with her legs splayed; her sex an invitation. Charlotte shuffled on the leather. She forced her legs wider apart. Julian moved quickly. He hauled Charlotte to a sitting position. Then, he made a circular motion with his index finger. Charlotte stared at him for a moment, and then realisation dawned. She knelt on the sofa and rested her elbows on the low armrest. She pushed her backside high and lowered her torso until her rear was offered to her handsome lover. 

"Fuck," Charlotte whispered as Julian sank balls deep into her body. 

"Shit," Vanessa cursed when she heard Charlotte's voice. She glared at her treacherous brother as he began grunt and sigh in time with his rapid thrusting. Vanessa heard the squelching slide of Charlotte's body accepting her brother's cock. That sound and the maddening slap, slap, slap of their coupling angered her. She turned to Peter. The thick, rubber cock strapped to her body glistened with lube and waggled with her movements. 

Peter smirked. He knew what was to come. He welcomed it. Without waiting for any instruction he moved close to where Charlotte and Julian were fucking. He knelt so that his face was inches from Charlotte's. The blonde looked at him through eyes heavy-lidded with lust. He kissed her. He held her cheeks in his palms and forced his tongue into her mouth. Charlotte accepted him willingly. 

Vanessa moved to a point behind Peter. She saw the mature woman and the Polish pig kissing. Another flash of anger burst through her. "You bastard," she murmured. "You and that whore and my cunt of a brother ..." 

Peter gasped into Charlotte's open mouth as Vanessa forced the rubber cock into his anus. His sphincter rebelled at first, it tightened against the smooth, round tip as Vanessa pushed roughly, but eventually, the brute force of Vanessa's will defeated Peter's fragile body. The membrane opened and the inches slid into Peter's dirty-hole. 

The scene descended into an orgiastic display of debauchery. Charlotte panted and grunted as Julian fucked into her with energetic strokes. Julian himself moaned as he reached under Charlotte's body and cupped the heavy, swinging tits in his palms. He rolled the thick, rubbery teats between his fingers and continued to stab Charlotte's swollen vulva as he nibbled and bit her exposed neck. 

Vanessa mauled at her own breasts as she punished Peter for his intransigence. How dare he kiss that slut! She grabbed her skin and pulled at her nipples until the tender flesh of her tits was red and swollen. She cursed her brother for his weakness while she pounded relentlessly into Peter's arse. Most of all, Vanessa wanted to punish the voluptuous blonde, who even now, was moaning through the minor tremors of the beginning of her climax. 

Peter was pulling at his enormous cock as Vanessa buggered him. He loved the feeling of the hard yet pliable dildo as it filled his rectum so solidly. He adored the sensations from his arse and his cock as he tugged at it. He stared into Charlotte's eyes and he felt the surge of his climax begin. He turned and pushed Vanessa away from himself. The strap-on slid from his anus and hung between Vanessa's legs -- an obscene parody. He stood quickly and aimed his cock at Charlotte's face. 

The blonde recognised his intent immediately. She smirked and opened her mouth to speak. "You filthy bastard—" she began, but got no further as the first spray of Peter's semen splashed across her face. More of the stuff spattered onto the leather between her elbows, while further spurts landed in her hair, on her shoulder, and against her swinging breasts. 

Julian came next. He grunted and clawed at Charlotte's generous hips as his seed pumped into the blonde's body. The tickling, pulses of Julian's spunk inside her, coupled with the hot splashes of Peter's goo, fired Charlotte's orgasm. She added her cries and groans of delight to the cacophony of outpoured lust as she jerked and twitched in the rapture of her release. 

Eventually the spent trio looked at Vanessa. The woman's eyes sparked venom as she stared back at them. 

Finally, Charlotte spoke: "You look so delicious like that, Vanessa." She gestured towards her employee with a sweep of her hand. Vanessa glared back at her, with her blouse hanging open, her skirt still high on her hips, and her dangerous looking shoes still on her feet. "You look good enough to eat." 

Vanessa's look softened and a sly smile crossed her face. "Do I?" she murmured. She undid the straps that held the dildo against her body. "Come and eat me then." She walked to the chair that Charlotte had originally been bound to, and hooked her legs over the arms just as the blonde had done earlier. 

Charlotte smirked and went to Vanessa. They kissed and Vanessa licked a dollop of Peter's spunk from Charlotte's breasts. The mature blonde knelt between Vanessa's thighs; she stared at the girl intently and then, after a lascivious wink, bent to the task. 

"Lick her, Peter," Vanessa groaned as Charlotte tongued her excited clitoris and pushed two fingers inside her opening. "Suck my brother's cum out of her." 

The Polish man grinned. He stroked his cock and moved behind Charlotte. She in turn, while still keeping up her oral attention on Vanessa's thick-lipped vulva, pushed her derriere as high as she could manage. 

Peter held Charlotte's labia apart and was rewarded by the sight of a viscous trickle of semen. The goo dribbled from Charlotte's hole and ran over her clitoris before a thick drop of the stuff fell to the carpet. 

With a moan, Peter forced his face against the sticky mess and pushed his tongue deep into the blonde. 

Charlotte groaned and turned her head to face the man behind her. "Kiss me," she sighed. "I want to taste it too." Peter leaned across the blonde's back and kissed her. Their tongues slid and danced, with Julian's cum acting as gooey lubrication. Peter broke away and moved back to Charlotte's oozing sex while Charlotte herself returned her attention to Vanessa's need. 

Poor Julian, forgotten and excluded, merely stood by and stared. He'd been sharing the apartment with Vanessa for a few weeks, ever since his marriage break-up had sent him running back to London, he'd always known his sister possessed a kinky streak, but the scene in front of him now ... 

Vanessa, through heavy, lust-laden eyes, looked up at him. She smiled at her brother, and then a laugh burst from her throat. "Not as I planned, Julian," she grinned. "But the bitch is sucking my cunt ..." Vanessa moaned and ran her fingers through the disarray of Charlotte's hair. Her hips lifted in a series of spasmodic jerks and her head lolled backwards. "I'm ... It's ... Just there, curl your fingers inside me just—" Vanessa groaned loudly and surrendered to the sensations elicited through Charlotte's fingers probing at the spongy walls inside her body. She gave a bestial grunt and held the blonde's mouth tight against her body. She mushed her dripping sex against Charlotte's face and gave voice to her climax. 

Peter watched Vanessa orgasm powerfully and then -- with his tumescence renewed -- eased his thick cock into Charlotte. 

Charlotte gasped when she felt the brute invading her body again. Peter's intrusion caused Julian's deposit of goo to squelch around the root of his cock. The ooze ran in a quick trickle over his hanging balls and dripped to the carpet between his knees. 

The scene ended after only a few moments of frenetic activity from Peter. He clawed at Charlotte's generous hips, grunted loudly, and pumped a second load into her body. 

The trio collapsed into varying poses of drained satisfaction while Julian continued to play the spectator role. 

Charlotte, exhausted, laid her head in Vanessa's lap. "Work is going to be ... interesting," she murmured. 

The woman's green eyes flashed in devilment and she stroked Charlotte's blonde hair gently. 

She could hardly wait for Monday. Report_Story
