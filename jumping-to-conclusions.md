Jumping to Conclusions

I left the apartment at my usual time and pulled out of the parking lot onto the street. I turned and headed down Cortez to the stop sign at Monte Vista and then hung a left. Twenty minutes would have me at work and if it was a normal Friday and the day had no surprises I would be able to leave work early and head for the lake. I had the tent and the rest of the gear in the back of the pickup and all I would need to do is stop and get ice. 

 I reached over and turned on the radio and caught the last of George Jones doing 'The Cold Hard Truth.' The song ended and the DJ said: 

 "Nobody does it like 'Ole Possum' and now here is Susan with traffic and weather." 

 Susan told me that there were no tie-ups on my route and that my weekend would be warm and sunny. After a half dozen commercials for services I would never use and products I would never buy the DJ came back: 

 "Good morning. It is 7:06 on this beautiful Friday the ninth of June and you are listening to KXYZ. Here is Rhonda Vincent to take you for a ride on 'The Bluegrass Express." 

 I love Rhonda Vincent and The Rage, but I reached over and turned the radio off. The ninth of June. I'd totally forgotten that the day was the ninth of June. How the hell could I have forgotten that? The ninth of June. The day my marriage ended. It had taken some time to try and put that day behind me, but the memory was always there and as I drove to work it all came back to me. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It started with a business trip to Chicago. I'd kissed my wife Shari goodbye, told her I'd call her as soon as I got to Chicago and checked into the hotel. The flight was uneventful and I took the courtesy bus to the hotel and then called Shari to let her know where she could reach me. 

 I sat at the table in the room and reviewed the papers I would be going over with the customer the next day and around seven I headed down to the hotel restaurant to get a bite to eat. After a fairly decent top sirloin I went into the hotel lounge to listen to the live band and have a drink or two. 

 I was sitting at the bar nursing a vodka tonic when a throaty voice behind me said into my ear: 

 "Want me to suck your cock honey?" 

 I quickly turned and saw Annette Carlson standing there. Annette had been my steady girlfriend during my first two years of college. We had torn up our share of bed sheets during those two years and had parted somewhat amicably when she told me that she wanted to fuck other guys. Her exact words were still burned into my memory. 

 "I like you a lot Frank, but I was a virgin when we met and I want to experience some life while I'm still young." 

 Until the moment she laid that on me I was actually considering getting a ring and going to a knee in front of her. The quickness with which I dropped that idea told me that it probably wouldn't have been all that great an idea in the first place. I heard later that she had developed a reputation as 'an easy piece' around campus. And here she was fifteen years later standing behind me in a hotel bar in Chicago. 

 She threw her arms around me, hugged me and told me that it was so good to see me and then she invited me to join her and her husband at their table. I told her no thanks, that I didn't want to intrude and she said: 

 "Nonsense. Come on" and she grabbed my arm, pulled me off my stool and led me over to where her husband sat waiting. On the way to their table she leaned close and said: 

 "You don't have to mention my greeting to you. Harry wouldn't understand." 

 "Too bad. I was giving some serious thought to taking you up on your offer." 

 That of course wasn't true. I had never cheated on Shari and I never intended to, but it seemed like the thing to say at the time. Annette introduced me to her husband and then we proceeded to bore the poor guy to tears as Annette and I went through the old friends ritual of "Have you heard from_______," "Whatever happened to_____" and "Did you hear about_____." 

 Harry got up to use the men's room and Annette watched him walk away. When he was out of sight she said: 

 "Why did you ever let me get away?" 

 "As I remember it I didn't let anything happen. You just flat out told me that you wanted to sample the male population at school and you said goodbye." 

 "Biggest mistake of my life. I already had the best and didn't know it." 

 "Thanks; I think." 

 "Its true baby and you know it. Besides being a super nice guy you had the best cock that I've ever had in me and I was stupid to let you get away." 

 "That isn't a nice way to talk with your husband just down the hall." 

 "Harry is a sweetheart and I'm glad I have him, but he is only so-so in the bedroom. He is what I picked and I knew what I was getting when I got him, but that doesn't mean I have to flush memories down the toilet." 

 Harry came back and the conversation turned to things that included him and we sat there, talked and drank for about an hour. The Annie's cell phone rang and after saying hello the conversation went: 

 "I suppose." 

 "I'll have to ask Harry." 

 "Hey! You remember Frank Corbett?" 

 "He's sitting across from me right now." 

 "Hang on; let me check." 

 She turned to me. "You remember Mary Ellen Frasier?" I nodded a yes. "She's Mary Ellen Watson now. She's having a party and there will probably be a few others there you know. Want to go?" 

 I had nothing better to do so I said yes. Then I said that I needed to run up to my room first and Annie asked me if she could come up and use my bathroom. 

 "I'd rather use a real towel to clean up with instead of the paper towels in the ladies' room here." 

 As we walked to the elevators Annie, who had taken on a few more drinks than I had giggled and said: 

 "I hope that no one who knows me is seeing this." 

 "Seeing what" her husband asked. 

 "Me going up to a hotel room with two men." 

 Her husband said, "It will probably look even worse than that. They will see your husband leaving you and letting you to go up to a room with a strange man. God knows what they would think about that." 

 "Why? Where are you going?" 

 "To get the car. I'll meet you out front." 

 He went off and Annie and I got on the elevator. As the door closed behind us Annie giggled again and said: 

 "It's a good thing I love my husband or I'd make good on my earlier offer right here in this elevator. Would you let me baby? Would you let your old girlfriend suck your dick?" 

 Knowing that she was just being playful I said, "You bet your sweet ass I would." 

 Let me be honest here. Annie was one hell of a sexy looking woman and she had been superb when it came to sucking cock so even though I had no intention of doing anything her looks and the memory of her magic mouth had given me a hard on and she noticed. She reached down and touched the bulge, stroked it and giggled as she said: 

 "It remembers me. Can I see it? For old times sake?" and she reached for my zipper. 

 I was just reaching down to push her hand away when we reached my floor and the elevator door opened. Annie snatched her hand away, but not before the couple waiting for the elevator saw it. The woman looked away embarrassed and the man gave me a knowing grin as we exited the elevator and Annie giggled and said "Oops." 

 We entered my room and Annie used the bathroom while I got my address book and a pen out of my briefcase. I wanted it so I could enter the addresses and phone numbers if there were a lot of people at Mary Ellen's that I knew. Annie came out of the bathroom and I went in and checked myself in the mirror and saw the 'five o'clock' shadow. I grabbed the electric razor and did a quick clean up, left the bathroom, got Annie and headed downstairs. Harry was waiting out front and we drove over to a house on Chicago's south side. 

 Besides Mary Ellen I knew a good half dozen of the people there from my college days. It was a very enjoyable evening and as far as I was concerned it was over too soon. I told several that I wanted to stay in touch and I put their phone numbers and addresses in my book. Harry and Annie drove me back to the hotel and I went to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day went well and I called Shari and told her I would be home by eight. In a husky voice she said: 

 "Then I'll expect you in our bedroom at eight-oh-one and you had better be ready for a hot welcome home." 

 Thoughts of the feast waiting for me had me hard as a steel bar when I walked into the house at seven fifty-six. I dropped my suitcase and briefcase on the living room floor and headed for our bedroom. 

 I walked through the door and saw Shari spread on the bed in garter belt, high heels and nylons just as I was grabbed by several pairs of hands. I was caught off guard and the four men had forced me down on a chair before I could even begin to struggle. When I did begin to yell and struggle a pair of socks was stuffed into my mouth and then with rope that they already had handy they tied me to the chair. 

 Shari got off the bed and walked over to stand in front of me. 

 "Do I look good baby?" Do I look hot in your favorite garter belt and nylons? How about my heels? They are your favorite 'come fuck me' pumps. I wanted to look my best for you as I give you your very own private porn show." 

 She turned and walked to the bed where the four men, one of whom I recognized as a guy she worked with, now sat naked with hard ons. She went to her knees in front of the one on the left, looked over at me and winked, and then she went down on him. Until then I had been struggling in a vain attempt to get loose, but when her mouth closed on the man's cock all the fight went out of me and I died inside. 

 Shari worked her way along the line of sitting men always looking at me and smiling before she took the man in her mouth. She spent about two minutes on each man and then went back to where she stared and ran the line again. Next she got on the bed and spread herself wide and took the four men on one after the other and when all four were finished they took a break and went into the kitchen for I'm guessing some refreshment after which they came back. 

 Shari got on the bed and took them on two at a time. While one fucked her she sucked on a second one while the other two played with her breasts and kissed her on the neck and ears. Then one took her ass while another fucked her in the cunt. I could see that her nipples were hard and the men playing with her tits moved to suck on them. 

 There was no slow ands easy fucking. The men fucked her hard and she was very vocal in her appreciation. After they had all cum a second time they adjourned for more refreshment. When they came back Shari took off the garter belt and the by now laddered and cum soaked nylons, but she slipped her heels back on. She looked over at me and said: 

 "Thank you for this. I'm having more fun than the law should allow and I owe it all to you. I don't know if you enjoyed that whore you had in your hotel room as much as I'm enjoying this, but thank you for giving me the opportunity." 

 She turned to go back to her herd and as I looked at her back as she walked away I was confused. I gave her the opportunity? Then it hit me! "The whore in your room last night." Somehow she had learned about Annie and had totally misread things. I was being paid back for a wrong that I had never committed and Shari would never know it because after what she was now doing I doubted that I would ever speak to her again. 

 When she got back on the bed she said to her crew, "I want to try something that I've read about. Any of you guys heard of making a girl airtight?" 

 One of them smiled and said, "Dibs on your ass" and Shari laughed as the four men moved her into position. The guy who called 'dibs' on her ass laid down and Shari moved over him and eased his cock into her ass as she settled onto him in the reverse cowgirl position. Then she leaned back and another guy moved into her in the missionary position. The two men started working into her trying to establish a working rhythm. The guy under her supported her with his hands so her hands were free. The remaining two men took a position on either side of her and she looked at me and winked before she took the one on her right into her mouth and the one on her left into her hand and started stroking him. After that it was just bodies moving around as the four men used her and she moaned and screamed and had orgasms. 

 Then it was over and the four men dressed and left. 

 "Just a little longer baby" she said as the last of them went out the door. "I need to clean up and then we will have a little talk." 

 She went into the bathroom and I heard the shower start. It was almost a half hour before she came back into the room still naked. She had combed her hair and put on fresh makeup and she walked to the closet and got a robe and put it on. She came over to me and took the socks out of my mouth and as she started to untie the ropes holding me to the chair she said: 

 "What you just saw baby is what I'll do every time you cheat on me. I'm almost -- notice I said almost -- hoping that you might cheat a lot. It was awesome. I could get used to it if I let myself." 

 The ropes fell away and I tried to stand, but hours of being tied so that I couldn't move had their effect on me and I staggered and almost fell and had to grab the chair to keep from falling to the floor. Shari said: 

 "Come over here and sit down on the bed and we will talk." 

 I ignored her and stumbled toward the bathroom, but didn't make it before I fell to the floor. Shari came over to help, but I snarled at her to get the fuck away from me. I took a long overdue piss, splashed some cold water on my face, dried off and then walking a little better I left the bathroom and walked through the bedroom to the stairs and started down them. Shari was behind me. 

 "Where are you going? We have to talk Rob. We have to get some things straight." 

 I ignored her and walked to where I had dropped my suitcase and briefcase when I'd gotten home, picked them up and walked out of the house. Shari was standing in the front doorway calling out: 

 "Where are you going Rob? This isn't helping any. Get back here. We have to talk." 

 She was still yelling at me as I backed down the drive, turned right when I got to the street and drove off. I found a motel close to work, checked in, left a call for six in the morning, got into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 When the call from the desk came I got up, showered and then headed to the Village Inn for breakfast. While eating I made a mental list of what I needed to do that morning. At eight I called my boss and let him know that I was back in town, but had some personal business I needed to take care of and that I'd be in around noon. 

 By nine I had cleaned out the bank accounts and taken every thing of value out of the safe deposit box. I walked down the street to a different band and opened new accounts and got a new safe deposit box. By ten I'd cancelled all of our credit cards except for my American Express and one Visa card that was in my name only. 

 I called Shari's office and asked for her and as soon as she said hello and I knew that she was at work I hung up and drove home. By eleven I had every thing I needed to get me through the next couple of weeks. 

 When I got to work the receptionist handed me a stack of message slips and two thirds of them were from Shari. I separated them from the pile and dropped them into the trash can sitting next to Carol's desk. Then I told Carol that Shari and I had separated and not to take any more messages from her or put any of her calls through to me. 

 I stopped in at Ben's office and brought him up to date on my meetings in Chicago and then told him I might have to take some unscheduled vacation time. I told him that Shari and I had separated and I needed some time to find an apartment and move in. He asked me if I could hold off on taking the time off for a couple of days. 

 "I need you to go to Atlanta and handle a situation there. You will probably be gone four or five days." 

 I told him "No problem" and it really wasn't. It would get me out of town and away from anything that Shari might try. I would almost bet that by the time I left Ben's office Shari would have been declined on her credit cards. She wouldn't be able to get me by phone so she would probably come to my office, but by then I should be in the air on my way to Atlanta. 

 I cautioned Ben and Carol against letting Shari know I had gone out of town and then I hit the motel, got my stuff and headed for the airport. As I waited for my flight to be called I grabbed one of those free apartment finders magazines and started going through it and making a list of places to check out when I got back to town. 

 About halfway to Atlanta it occurred to me that I had forgotten something important. I used the in flight phone to call Ben and tell him to take my paycheck off of 'direct deposit' and hold it for me until I could get back and change it to my new bank. 

 While I had him on the phone he told me that he had talked to Shari. When she couldn't get me on the phone she insisted that Carol put her through to Ben. She tried to badger Ben into making me take her calls and Ben had told her that I had told him we were separated and then he told her that communication between her and me were not a company problem and he was not going to get involved and then he had hung up on her. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I got into Atlanta I checked into a hotel, got a good nights sleep. The next day was spent putting out fires at the Atlanta office and when I got back to the hotel I called my parents, my brother George and my sister Mary and brought them up to speed on my separation from Shari. I didn't go into detail, I just told them I came home from a business trip early and found something that I didn't care for. My mom told me that Shari had called and asked mom to have me call her which of course I didn't. 

 The next morning at nine I called Ben to give him an update and he surprised me. After telling me that he had seen Shari the previous evening, "I guess since she couldn't get you on the phone she decided to wait in the parking lot for you to get off work" he said: 

 "How do you like Atlanta?" 

 "I've only been here a few times, but it seems like a nice place." 

 "Is your separation from Shari a temporary thing while you try to work some things out, or is it something that will end up in a divorce?" 

 "There is no chance of us getting back together." 

 "Then how would you feel about moving?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "This is the third time I've had to send somebody to Atlanta to fix things. I'm going to let Falstaff go. Would you like the Atlanta office?" 

 "Hell yes I would." 

 "Okay then, you have it. We will work out the details when you get back." 

 It was a hell of a boost to my ego and as I sat there smiling it occurred to me that a move to Atlanta would take away the hassle of trying to avoid Shari and it would have been a hassle. If she was going to sit in parking lots and wait for me what else would she try? I wasn't afraid to face her; I just didn't want to. 

 From the way she had talked as she untied me it was obvious to me that her mindset was "Okay, now we are even and we can put this behind us" but there was no way that was ever going to happen. If she had gone out and screwed some guy in a motel room and then come home and told me "Okay, now we are even" our marriage would still have been over, but for her to do what she did with four men and expect me to accept it? No way! No fucking way! 

 All a face to face would accomplish was I would probably spit in her face. I knew why she had done it and I wasn't at all happy with that. She didn't trust me enough to give me the benefit of the doubt until she could talk with me? Fuck her! No sir, better to just walk away. I wasn't going to go for a divorce! I was just going to walk away.

 I finished up in Atlanta and headed for home. I left the airport and checked into a hotel close to work and then I went in to the office and brought Ben up to date. We talked about my taking the Atlanta office and set a timeline for it to happen. Then I took a couple of days off to take care of some personal business. 

 I was parked down the street from the house when Shari went to work and as soon as she turned the corner I punched a number in on my cell phone, said we were good to go, and a couple of minutes later a Ryder rental truck driven by my brother George pulled onto the drive way. Behind it a car pulled in and parked and Skip and Cory, two very good friends of mine, got out and joined George and me. In two hours I had everything I wanted out of the house. I took all of my personal things, the home desktop computer, printer and enough furniture to set me up in an apartment in Atlanta. 

 I saw an attorney and had him draw up a power of attorney for my brother and then I put a copy of it in an envelope along with a note that said: 

 "Call George when you are ready to sell the house. He will act for me." 

 I didn't bother to sign it and I dropped it in the mail. She would get it in about two days and by then I would be on the road to Atlanta. I didn't care about the house. We had refinanced to put in the swimming pool and tennis court and I doubted that there would be any equity to speak of when the costs of selling were deducted from the proceeds. 

 I had one more stop to make and I told the man what I wanted, gave him some money and then I drove over to the place where I had rented the truck and they hooked a car hauling trailer on the back. I drove to George's house and loaded my car on the trailer and a half hour later I was Atlanta bound. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I called Ben and let him know that I was in place in Atlanta and he set his plan in motion. He flew into Atlanta that night and the next morning he went into the office and terminated Falstaff and sent all the people home for the day after telling them there would be no loss in pay and for them to return to work the next morning. 

 I'd spent the day checking out apartments and had settled on one by the time I met Ben for dinner. Over dinner he told me that Shari had been in the parking lot almost every day and sometimes twice a day -- in the morning trying to catch me coming in to work and then again in the evening to catch me when I got off. 

 "Once she even stopped Carol and offered her a hundred dollars to get her past the security guard in the lobby and get her up to your office. It appears that she still doesn't know that you are gone." 

 The next morning we were in the office to great the staff when they came to work. Ben brought them up to date on what was happening, wished me luck and then headed for the airport. 

 The next week and a half were spent moving into my new apartment, gathering the reins of my new office and getting to know my staff while they got to know me. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 On the last Friday of the second week I received a package in the mail and I set it aside for review over the weekend. My apartment was on the second floor and had a small balcony that overlooked the swimming pool. I bought a small patio table and two chairs for use on the porch. Saturday morning I sat at the table drinking coffee and going through the contents of the package I'd received. 

 It had cost me a pretty penny, but I felt that it was well worth it. Operating on the assumption that Shari had enlisted Steve (he was the co-worker that I had recognized) to help her organize the gangbang and that they had set it up in a day I was sure that he used some of his buddies to fill out the gang. I gave the private detective all that I knew about Steve and then I gave him the physical descriptions of the other three men that had been there with him that night. I told the detective that I wanted him to follow Steve and see if Steve met with anyone who fit the descriptions and if so get me the information on them. 

 The results were way better than I expected. Steve had indeed met several times with three men who fit the descriptions that I had given the detective and a stroke of pure luck confirmed that the three were the men I wanted to find. The operative that had been following Steve saw him meet the three in a sports bar and he had gotten the booth next to them. He overheard them discussing the gangbang and talking about when they could do it again. He didn't hear if it was going to happen because he had gotten up to call for help in following the three when they left the bar. It had been hideously expensive, but I had the names, addresses, and places of employment of all four of the assholes. I began to make plans. 

 ++++++++++++++ 

 It was three months before I was able to arrange a weekend trip. I drove -- no airline trail for anyone to follow -- and I carried extra gas in cans so no fuel stops would trip me up. When I went into work on Monday morning I was carrying the satisfaction of knowing that it would be a hell of a long time before Steve Bowen used his sexual equipment again. Cast iron pipe applied repeatedly to the crotch area sometimes had a detrimental effect on the male reproductive organs. It seems that a hooded man had caught Bowen in his apartment parking lot and stomped the shit out of him before taking his watch, rings, wallet and everything that was in his pockets. 

 Three weeks later the same thing happened to Archie Mellon and Jeff Montrose. By the time I made my third trip Norm Reed had apparently figured out what Bowen, Mellon and Montrose had in common and he took a job in another state and got the hell out of Dodge. Pity, but three out of four wasn't bad. I debated hiring a private detective to find him, but then decided not to. 

 The next five months went by and the job was going well. I'd met several of the bikini clad ladies that lounged around the apartment pool and I got to know a couple very well. One, a flight attendant named Brandy, managed to find her way into my bed and when she wasn't flying or visiting her folks she was keeping time with me. It was a good arrangement for both of us until the day she told me that she was getting married to one of the captains she regularly flew with. I guess when she wasn't in my bed she was in his when they overnighted somewhere. As a parting gift she did set me up with another flight attendant named Gloria and we hit it off. Gloria let me know up front that she wasn't interested in anything but a friends with benefits relationship which suited me just fine. 

 I was in the dumps for a couple of days after losing Brandy and before hooking up with Gloria and then it got worse. I got home from work one Tuesday night, pulled into the parking lot, shut off the car, got out and heard: 

 "Hello Rob." 

 I turned and there stood Shari. I just stood there and stared at her. 

 "Surprised to see me?" 

 "More disappointed than surprised." 

 "Disappointed?" 

 "I hoped that I'd never set eyes on you again. The way I left you should have told you that." 

 "Maybe it would have if you had filed for divorce. The fact that you haven't made me hope that we could patch things up and get on with our life together." 

 "No chance of that. Your gangbang put an end to that." 

 "How can you hold that against me after what you did?" 

 "I don't even know what it is that I'm supposed to have done." 

 "Bullshit Rob. I told you that I was getting even with you for having that whore in your room when I called." 

 "I didn't have a whore in my room Shari." 

 "Don't give me that Rob. I called you and a woman answered the phone. I asked her who she was and she told me and then asked who I was. When I said I was your wife she giggled and said: 

 "Oh, you are the lucky one who gets his great cock all the time" and then she hung up on me." 

 "So you, without bothering to talk to me about it got stupid and had a gangbang to teach me a lesson. That about cover it?" 

 "Exactly!" 

 "First of all Annie wasn't a whore. She and her husband were waiting for me to use the bathroom in my room and then they were going to take me to a party where there were some people I went to school with. Annie had taken on a few more drinks that she probably should have and she was probably trying to be cute when you called." 

 "Get off it Rob; she flat out as good as told me that she was aware of your cock size." 

 "She was. Annie was my girlfriend through my first two years of college and then we broke up. Again, she was with her husband. All of that you could have found out if you had bothered to talk to me before ruining our marriage. As far as divorcing you is concerned it was in my best interest not to file, but let you do it." 

 "How do you figure that?" 

 ] 

 "I would have had to split our assets equally with you if I had filed before I left." 

 "You will still have to even if I do file." 

 "Maybe, but the assets we would have to split would be the assets we held jointly at the time of filing and as of right now that is only the house and there isn't enough equity in it to waste time on." 

 "If you are going to wait on me to go for a divorce you've got a long wait coming. As long as we are married there is always a chance." 

 "No Shari; there isn't a chance in hell. You showed me what you really think of me when you put on your display of pique. You showed me that you have no trust in me and you showed me that you thought I was a spineless wimp who would just accept what you did and say: 

 "Sorry; I'll be a good boy from now on." 

 "You killed the marriage Shari and there is no way in hell that it can ever be resurrected." 

 "You are wrong. I don't think you are spineless. I expected you to be outraged just as I was when that woman spoke to me on the phone. I know you aren't a wimp. That's why I had them tie you to the chair to keep you under control. I love you Rob. I love you, want you and need you." 

 "That's just too fucking bad Shari because I don't want you. Not after being tied in that fucking chair and watching you for hours. You know what struck me the most as I sat there? The ease with which you did it and how quick you managed to set it up. As if it was something that you had done many times before. You seemed very comfortable with those four guys. It was almost like you were attuned to each other. Relieving a shared experience as it were." 

 Her face paled. "Oh no, oh no Rob. Never. I swear to God, never before." 

 "Unfortunately Shari I don't have any trust in you anymore so I don't believe it. But no matter; the once was enough. Look on the bright side. You did say it was awesome and that you could get used to it so now you can. Call your four studs and have at it." 

 "I couldn't even if I wanted to." 

 "Why not? I'm certainly not going to be in the way." 

 "You know why not. You know what you did and even if they can't prove it they know it was you." 

 "Sorry Shari; I have no idea what you are talking about." 

 "I'm not stupid Rob. When three of the four end up in then hospital emergency room and the only thing they have in common was that evening with me it wasn't all that hard to figure out who was responsible." 

 "Only three? Why not four?" 

 "Because Norm figured it out too and moved out of town before you could get to him." 

 "Any idea where he went?" 

 "Why would you want to know?" 

 "Just curious." 

 "You aren't that good a liar Rob." 

 "So those four aren't available so what? You came up with those four quick enough. It shouldn't be all that hard for you to come up with some different guys." 

 "I don't want any other guys. I want you. I've put the house up for sale and as soon as it is sold I'm moving here to Atlanta." 

 "Why in the hell would you want to do that?" 

 "To be close to you. There isn't anyway we can put things back together if we are six hundred miles apart." 

 "Haven't you heard anything I've said? We will not be getting back together. You being here and me seeing you from time to time will only remind me of you and your four fuck buddies and that is a memory that I am trying to get rid of not reinforce." 

 "Say what you will Rob, but I intend to get you back. It might not be easy and it might take a while, but I am going to do it." 

 "In a pig's ass" I said as I turned from her and went into my apartment. I never did ask her how she'd found me. Hired a private detective I suppose. I did wonder why I hadn't heard the phone ring when she called. It must have been when I was using my electric razor.

 She did sell the house and move to Atlanta and she managed to get an apartment in the same apartment complex where I lived. Not in the same building thank God, but still way to close to suit me. It seemed like every night when I came home from work there was a note slipped under my door telling me that she was making one of my favorites and inviting me over for dinner. Notes inviting me to go to this or that with her or to meet her after work for a drink. I ignored all of them, but the one I found last night had me thinking. It said: 

 "We both like sex and I haven't had any since you know when. How about a friends with benefits relationship? Or forget the friends and do a neighbors with benefits. What do you think?" 

 I thought about it most of the night and part of the morning. Shari was damned good in the bedroom and .... Suddenly I woke up to what I was thinking, shook my head to clear it and muttered "Fuck no!" I made a mental note to call Gloria when I got back from camping and then I reached over and turned the radio back on and listened to Toby Keith sing about how much he liked a bar. Report_Story
