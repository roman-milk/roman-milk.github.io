Naughty Girl Ch. 01
===================

Bernice was willing to indulge her husband, as it was a naughty fantasy of hers too. She took off her coat and threw it into the car, together with the keys. Unable to get back into the car, now meant it was impossible to back out of the game. This gave her an added thrill. She was committed to walking across the park, to meet her husband. 

 She was dressed in a schoolgirl uniform, feeling very naughty and sexy. She was more than ready, for her husband to pick her up. She was prepared to flirt with him, and just maybe, they might go that little bit further, if the situation was right. 

 Her heart raced as she made her way into the park. It wasn't windy, so she agreed to wear a thong, under the short skirt. The white blouse was tight across her small breasts, and she wasn't wearing a bra. They felt exposed in the thin blouse, as the nipples showed faintly through it. 

 *** 

 She was twenty-four, and slightly built, with a baby face. It was this, and the times she had to show Id to get a drink, that made him dare her. Of course, she knew there was more to it than that. He knew she liked to show off her long, sensuous legs in public. 

 Sometimes it was possible to go a little further, if the opportunity arose. At the beach, she let the bikini top accidently slip a little, for a moment or two, before pulling it back into place. Recently she had bent over, while fussing with a beach towel, knowing an old guy was behind her. 

 The bikini bottoms were pulling tight between her cheeks. It was an agony, not being able to turn around, to see if he had been watching. While bent over an attractive young woman walked passed, wiggling her uncovered bottom, cut by a thin string bikini. The guy was sure to be checking her out, so she glanced at him. 

 He was still looking at her near naked bottom! He was staring, seemingly mesmerised by the sight of her ass. Her face coloured up with embarrassment. His shorts seemed full of cock, he was so hard. She quickly sat, opening a book upside down, pretending to read. 

 She could feel her sex, burning with the heat of arousal. He hadn't even noticed the younger, more attractive woman. He had been so engrossed, with ogling her body. 

 That naughty moment confirmed she was an exhibitionist, though it took a few days to come to terms with it. When she did, the fantasies began to roll through her imagination. 

 A schoolgirl outfit, bought on-line, had been too tacky to wear outside the bedroom. On a mature, married woman, it looked positively lewd. So much so, she refused to go out in it. 

 While at a friend's house she borrowed a skirt, from a wash basket, while in the bathroom. It had been a moment of madness. Her friend's daughter wore it to school, so it wasn't too short for an adolescent. Though on her, it did look risqu√©, with long legs and white ankle socks. The blouse and school tie, were purchased at a local mall to go with the skirt. 

 She wore it in the bedroom, giving her husband a thrill. He cajoled her to wear it in public, and of course she refused. Thinking her husband was exaggerating, Bernice took a good look in the mirror. She had to admit it was true. She did look like an eighteen year old high school student. She could have walked down the street, with her friend's daughter, and everyone would assume they were school friends. 

 When the big day arrived she was so excited, they very nearly didn't leave the house. 

 *** 

 So here she was, wearing a daringly short skirt, dressed in a school uniform. She hesitated on entering the park gates, feeling highly nervous. 

 Plucking up courage Bernice walked into the park, feeling shy and anxious. Despite this, she felt naughty and highly aroused. 

 "Excuse me! Is this the South Gate?" a woman asked. 

 "Err, yes, ma'am," Bernice demurely answered. Oh! Shit! What the hell was she doing here? One of her employees was right there, talking to her. Joan was looking at her watch, so hadn't noticed who the young schoolgirl really was, yet. 

 The damn woman was the office gossip. Bernice dropped her head, in shame, trying to hide her face. It was fortunate not to have tied her long hair in pig-tails. 

 "Is it four yet, do you know?" Joan asked. 

 "Err, I think so," Bernice nervously answered. 

 "Well, students these days! Can't you look at me when I'm talking to you?" Joan demanded. The woman took a hold of her wrist, to look at a Mickey Mouse watch. Bernice still had it from school days. 

 Bernice remembered the woman was a bit of a bully as well as a gossip. She had to reprimand her once, for upsetting a secretary. 

 "Just look at you, dressed like a slut. I would have been sent home looking like that, not that I would have dared, of course. You young things should learn some respect for yourselves and your elders. If you were mine I'd put you over my knee and teach you some manners," Joan gleefully scolded her. 

 Bernice dare not look up. To be recognised by this dreadful woman, would put her in a difficult position. The gossip circulating around the offices would be intolerable. If she begged her to keep quiet, Joan could hold this over her for a long time to come. 

 She struggled from the woman's grip, needing to run away, like a frightened schoolgirl. The suddenly released grip had her tumbling to the ground. Joan looked down at her, with a look of condescension on her face. 

 "Good grief! Do you go to school like that? You really are a little slut," Joan smirked. 

 Bernice clamped her legs together, after revealing the thong, which was pulled tight into her crotch. She scrambled up off the grass, and mumbled her apologies. The horrid woman's laughter rang in her ears, leaving her feeling small and inadequate. Fighting down the need to retaliate, she scurried away, like a frightened rabbit. 

 The encounter left her giggling, as she felt all the more like a naughty schoolgirl, running off, on a dirty adventure. 

 This morning she had been dressed in an expensive silk business suit, leading her team, which included Joan. Now the woman had caught her in the park, wearing a schoolgirl's uniform. What if she had accidently done something, to warrant a punishment? Would she have been spanked, like a naughty girl, before everyone in the park? 

 The image of being spanked by an employee had her heart racing, from the sheer humiliation of it. 

 Joan had treated her like a naughty schoolgirl! The danger and fear from being under the woman's control, had been exciting. It was a good job she hadn't been recognised, as Joan was more than capable of taking advantage of a situation. 

 How would she explain it away? The woman was astute enough to figure out what she was up to. She would have enough ammunition to take advantage in the office. 

 It might even have started right here, in the park. Bernice dare not draw attention to herself, so she would have had to play along. The woman could humiliate her, just for the amusement of it. 

 *** 

 Bernice imagined being taken in hand, to be dragged round the park. Joan could make her play basket ball with the young guys. In the short skirt, wearing a thong, it would be shamefully embarrassing. Everyone would to see her bare ass, every time the skirt bounced up. The guys would be sure to comment rudely, on her bouncing, unfettered breasts. 

 Maybe she would be shown off to friends, while pretending Bernice was her niece. The woman could embarrass her, far more than a real aunt would. Bernice's imagination continued to work her up. 

 "Her parents don't look after the girl properly. Lift the skirt up and show them, do as you are told, girl," Joan demanded, and slapped a leg. "Just look at these panties. They are most unsuitable on a young girl," Joan told her friends. Joan took great pleasure in showing off her boss's panties to everyone, including the men. 

 "Her breasts are developing, so she should be wearing a bra, not just this tight blouse," Joan pointed out. 

 In an agony of embarrassment Bernice lifted the top, to show off her breasts to the woman's cronies. A couple of young guys walked by, and swivelled their heads to keep her in view, with a look of pleasurable surprise on their faces. 

 *** 

 Bernice was half way across the park when she looked back toward the south gate, wondering if Joan was still there. If Joan was watching her, it might be a sign that she had been recognised. She tripped and tumbled, landing on her face in the grass. 

 "Damn!" she cursed out loud. 

 At least Joan wasn't there. Bernice hoped the woman had walked off, with whoever she was meeting, and forgotten all about her. 

 Being blackmailed by the woman was frightening, though now the danger was over, it became exciting. Having to bow to an employee's will, would be humiliating, and that was doing something to her. 

 Sitting on the grass, she pulled her legs up, and wrapped her arms around them. Resting her chin on her knees, she slit her eyes to the low afternoon sun. Her pussy cried out for attention. With a slow slide over a thigh, her hand distractedly moved between her legs. 

 She meant to just press at the panties crotch, to adjust it, as it had slipped slightly. She began to fantasise about Joan again. 

 *** 

 "You need an appointment, you can't just walk in," Bernice's secretary explained to the woman. The tone of voice indicated that the likes of you, can't just walk in, you're not important enough. 

 Before Joan could say anything in retaliation, Bernice poked her head out the door and nodded to Joan. "It's alright, Joan has special privileges, she can call in anytime," Bernice told her secretary. A harrumph of irritation was all the response she got. 

 Joan strode into the boss's office, to find her next to the desk, standing at attention. "Have you followed all my instructions?" Joan demanded. 

 "Yes, miss," Bernice answered. The sound of her voice was pathetic, reflecting the way she felt. She was the boss, and was being blackmailed by this bitch employee, into obeying her whims. It was infuriation having to be submitting to Joan's demands. 

 "Show me," Joan demanded. 

 "Yes, miss," Bernice answered, in a little girly voice. It was one of Joan's demands that she must talk like a stupid girly. Lifting the skirt, she showed the woman a pair of black stockings, held up by red suspenders. The colour had been specified, as much as the rest of the clothes she was wearing. 

 "Good girl, no panties. Show me your chair," Joan mischievously smiled. "As I thought, you've been a naughty girl. Look at that wet patch! You will be punished for that," Joan gleefully pronounced. 

 "Oh! I'm sorry miss, really I am, please don't spank me. I'll be a good girl from now on. Honest I will, please don't spank me miss. I promise to do as I'm told, please, miss," Bernice whimpered. 

 All thought of her position was lost, as she genuinely pleaded with the older woman. She was back in the past, a naughty little girl, fearing a punishment. 

 "Why are you being punished? Speak up girl," Joan scolded her. Joan had taught her what to say, and just loved hearing her boss talk so contemptibly. She took great pleasure in punishing her, and took every opportunity to rub her nose in the dirt. 

 "I've been a dirty little slut of a girl. I've dirtied the leather chair with my sex juices, miss. I deserve to be thrashed, miss," Bernice spoke up, knowing she would have to repeat it all, if she murmured. 

 "Bend over," Joan grinned. It made it all the better, seeing her victim grimace. They both knew she enjoyed the humiliation, of being punished. It strengthened her grip on the boss. This important woman was having dinner with the mayor this evening, and that made this spanking all the more exciting. 

 *** 

 Bernice couldn't help it. Instead of adjusting the crotch of her panties, she played with herself. Out in the middle of a public field, made it a naughty thing to do. It made it exciting, and she was already sopping wet. It made her chuckle to think one of her employees had made her so wet. The fantasy was pushing the arousal to a fever pitch. There was no-one close, but she could see people walking their dogs, and playing games in the distance. 

 In her imagination she was bent over the desk in her office. With every imagined heavy slap Joan gave her bare bottom, she thrust a finger into her pussy. In-between each spank, she vigorously rubbed her clit. The fantasy seemed so real, she was carried away, deeply in need of an orgasm. Everything else around her had been blotted out. 

 "Keep going, you are nearly there," someone said. 

 Bernice opened her eyes, ever so slightly. Lying beside her was a man, watching her finger her pussy. She didn't even slow down, or miss a beat. She became aware of her moaning, in time with the imaginary slaps. A little hiss of breath sounded as she sucked in air. 

 "Fascinating!" he commented. "I've never seen anyone so carried away before," he whispered. 

 Was this too a part of the fantasy? Out of the corner of her eye she watched a hand approach, getting closer and closer. She felt it push up the top, and it pinch a nipple. The hand closed around her breast and gently squeezed. 

 The old man was there, in reality, and he was playing with her breasts! All she wanted in the world was to orgasm. There was nothing she could do, but work toward a climax. Her mind and body were in tune, working furiously toward big beautiful orgasm. 

 She was in the middle of a field, in a park, playing with herself, letting an old man fiddle with her tits. She felt a finger touch her asshole. Eventually the message reached the conscious part of her mind that it wasn't her finger! 

 She paid more attention to it. It was circling the little brown, pucker hole, down there, below her cheeks. It was pushing, now pressing insistently. It was in! Had she relaxed, to let it in, or had it forced its way in through persistence. The finger pushed and pulled in rhythm with her finger next door, working her pussy. The close neighbours worked together. 

 The hand cupping her breast squeezed tight. The finger in her asshole pushed deep. Two fingers in her pussy worked her slippery hole hard. Her free hand took the hint, and squeezed her other breast. Her mouth fell open, as she groaned a low animal, moaning whimper. 

 An orgasm walked all over her body, squashing it into the grassy field. It felt as though she were being rolled flat. Both his and her hands, and fingers, continued to work her body. She was lying flat, with limbs spread out, responding to the after shocks of an earthquake, with little shudders. 

 "Was that as good as it looked, young lady?" the stranger asked. 

 "Yes, thank you, sir" Bernice whispered. 

 Perhaps it was in her imagination, but the man doffed his hat and walked away. She closed her eyes for a moment or two then struggled up on one elbow. She felt guilty from letting a stranger play with her body. It was arousing too, despite having just cum. It had been nice, but she needed a cock inside her, for complete satisfaction. 

 The prospect of being led into the woods, by her husband, was looking very attractive. She might even drag him among the trees, to make up for this naughty act. 

 Bernice pulled at the hem of the short skirt, feeling vulnerable, and aroused by the danger of being exposed. A flood of guilt washed over her. Had she really been so carried away, that she let a stranger play with her body? Her husband often said she was vulnerable when aroused. It must be true. 

 She walked quickly, not looking back, in case she saw the old man. Heading for the north-side gate, she could see Angus, sauntering along a path. He must have seen her, for their paths would cross, near some trees. 

 Was that his plan? Was he going to try and sweet talk her into the woods? She was ready for it. It wouldn't take much. Her breaths came in short gasps, as she walked toward their rendezvous. He would know what the heavy breathing meant. 

 When this hot, it didn't take much to push her over the edge, into irresponsibility. Or, as he said in the bedroom, he aroused her, to become his naughty slut. He only had to whisper into an ear, to have her craving his cock. 

 That was in the privacy of their bedroom. It was disappointing to think he wouldn't take advantage out here. The thought of being discovered by someone, was enough to ramp up the excitement. There was no way she would let him take her out in the open, though in the woods she might. 

 Bernice was breathing hard, as though she had run all the way from the car. 

 She ran into him, when stumbling onto the path. He gripped her wrist to steady her, reinforcing the encounter with Joan. The touch was electric. She couldn't look at him, for he was sure to see how excited she was. He would be sure to take advantage of her submissiveness. 

 He knew how passive she became when aroused. At home, he would sometimes play at being a dominant master. He would order her to do things, naughty things, pushing past her inhibitions. Jim knew what she enjoyed, so it was fun and exciting to let go, letting him take charge. 

 Here though, it could be dangerous, if they both got out of hand. Bernice winced, on feeling that bad thought arouse her. She kept her head down, shielding her face, in long auburn hair. 

 He had a hold of her wrist, talking to her, so she had to focus on what he was saying. 

 "Well, why aren't you in school young lady? You nearly pushed me over!" he scolded her. 

 Bernice could hardly find a breath to reply. "Sorry, sir," she managed to say. 

 It was just perfect! This was all he had to do. He could whisk her away to his car right now, and have her home in twenty minutes. She wondered if she dare suck him, while he drove. She was that worked up, it was more than possible. 

 He had asked before, while on an empty road, and she had refused. Yet here in town, it was very likely she would initiate the wicked act. How could she bring herself to tell him how excited she was? Her legs trembled in anticipation of being so wicked. 

 "I've a good mind to take you to your parents, and tell them you're a bad adolescent," he loudly stated. 

 Bernice felt small and insignificant, as though she really was just a naughty girl. The game was especially stimulating after bumping into Jean. She was being shown up, in a public park, wearing just a thong under a short skirt. In the past, just showing off her legs had been a naughty thrill. She had gone way past that in the past hour. Even her nipples were getting in on the act, by poking out large, through the tight blouse. 

 She looked down at them, mesmerised by the way they swelled, and pushed against the thin blouse. 

 No-one took much notice when he told her off. Yet it was still a juicy thrill, being treated like a stupid eighteen year old. She dare not look up to see the people walking by. Jim knew her well enough, to know what he was doing to her. It was so very effective too. She could hardly stand, or think straight. More than ever before, she wanted to be at home, to be his naughty, uninhibited slut. 

 As though from nowhere, a young guy appeared from behind a tree. 

 "Hey, you! Leave her alone!" Harry shouted. 

 Bernice looked up, startled at the interruption, worried they had gone too far with the game. Jim was embarrassed too, from having their amusement interrupted. 

 The young guy was upon them before either could think what to do next. He grabbed Bernice's other wrist. 

 "I'll call the park ranger, if you don't let her go. They don't let perverts loose in the park," Harry shouted. 

 Jim looked at him in surprise. He didn't want anyone stopping to find out what was going on. 

 "You don't understand, she's, err, I mean," he tried to explain. He couldn't bring himself to say she was his wife. "It's OK. I'm going to take her home," he added. 

 "Ouch! Let go of my arm," Bernice squealed.  

 

 

===

"That's it pervert, let go of her right now!" Harry exclaimed. 

 Bernice wanted to explain it was the young guy hurting her wrist, not her husband. She yelped in pain instead, while caught between the two of them, in a tug of war. 

 Thinking the old man had hurt this girl, he shoved a hand at him. 

 Jim could easily overpower the young guy, though obviously, he didn't want to attract attention. It would be humiliating to be caught out like this. Besides, he would be in trouble if a park ranger came by. Fighting with a ruffian like this, would take some explaining. 

 Again they were taken by surprise. The rest of his friends stepped out from among the trees, and quickly surrounded them. Jim let go of his wife, to ward them off. When he manoeuvred around to face them, it turned out to be a mistake. 

 Harry shoved Bernice behind him, meaning to protect her from the mean old guy. His friends circled him, trapping her between them. They began to edge away, back toward the trees. Caught in their circle, with her wrist firmly grasped, she couldn't do a thing, except trip along with them. 

 "What do you think you are doing?" Jim lamely shouted. 

 "She's safe with us, away from old farts like you!" Harry sneered at Jim. 

 "Please, let me go," Bernice cried out. 

 "See, she doesn't want to stay with you. Go bother someone your own age," Harry shouted. 

 "Stop! You can't drag her away like that!" Jim shouted back. "She's my, just stop, right now," he complained, in confusion. He stood watching them hurry off with his wife. Within seconds they had disappeared into the undergrowth. 

 Bernice couldn't get her breath to shout at them. By the time she thought of telling the guy he was her uncle, they were away, lost in the woods. 

 "Shit!" Jim said, under his breath. It had happened so quickly. There was no time to think. One minute they were intently playing a game, the next she was gone. His excitement had been cut short, leaving him shaking with anger. 

 He just stood, staring at the spot where his wife had been dragged off. They were a bunch of eighteen year olds, trying to protect one of their own. All very commendable, except it was his wife they had hauled away. 

 He should have done something! There had been six of them, so it would have been difficult to manhandle or threaten so many. He shouted her name, attracting the attention of a passing couple. They asked if he had lost his dog. 

 He felt like telling them he had let his bitch wife off the leash. It had been for just a moment then she ran off into the woods, with a pack of wild dogs. He was close to laughing, though not in a pleasant way. Hysteria was patting him on the shoulder, ready to take over responsibility for his abject failure. 

 "Everything OK?" a ranger asked. He turned up on a bicycle, on his usual rounds. 

 "My, err, she was kind of dragged off, by a gang of juveniles," he stammered. 

 "Who was?" the ranger asked. 

 "My niece, Barbara," Jim lied. 

 "Who dragged her off," he asked, while making notes. "How old would you say they were? OK! I know who they are. She should be OK. I'll get them checked out, make sure she's alright. We know where they hang out," he said, trying to be reassuring. 

 "I need her back, not just checked out," Jim demanded. 

 "Are you her guardian?" he asked. 

 "No! I'm, err, just her uncle," Jim bluffed. 

 "Well, if she wants to stay out till the park closes, there's nothing I can do to make her leave," he stated. 

 "She'll want to go home with me," Jim said. 

 "Well, why did she run off with them in first place?" he asked. 

 It was getting complicated, and Jim knew sooner or later, he wouldn't have the right answers. If this carried on, he was sure to get caught out. Besides, if the police became involved, their sordid little game would be uncovered. 

 It was difficult to accept there was nothing he could do. How could he tell them, his wife had run off with a bunch of wayward youths? It was humiliating to even think about. If it was discovered, it would get back to people they knew. 

 "What should I do?" Jim asked. 

 "Where's your car parked? Go home and wait for her there. We'll phone you as soon as someone checks on them. I'll radio to another ranger. It won't take long, as we know where they get too. Don't go wandering off after them, you'll never find them in the forest. I don't want to go searching for you too," he sternly warned. 

 Jim looked at him, and shrugged his shoulders. It was demeaning having to leave his wife out there, in the woods, with a bunch of adolescents. They were probably laughing at him right now. 

 When she got home, he would be in trouble. She would blame him for this almighty disaster. Still, in years to come they might laugh about it. When they were old, they might even be bold enough to recount it to close friends. At the moment though, all he could think about, was what she would say once home. 

 Before getting into the car Jim looked back at the park gates. Shit! He felt so stupid. 

 He dressed his wife up in a little sexy skirt and top. He then worked her up into such a state she was dangerously close to an orgasm, in a public park. Then he let a bunch of lusty young guys drag her off into the woods. What a mess! 

 When she was that close to an orgasm, she became docile and easily controlled. That's when he called her his sexy slut. Only then it was when they were safely at home, in the bedroom. 

 So, those young guys had dragged into the woods, a sexy slut primed, and ready for anything. Out there were a bunch of randy young guys, with a horny experienced woman, dressed like an eighteen year old, and behaving like a sexy slut. They had no idea what they had let themselves in for. 

 He dare not think about the consequences. If it had been his niece, would it be any worse than being his wife out there? He just hoped she could bring herself under control, before one of them discovered how easily manipulated she was. 

 She was bound to have recovered her composure, and become angry with him by now. As a mature woman she would find a way to handle the situation, though it would be a close run thing. When she returned home, he would be in big trouble!

Chapter 02 

 In the woods with the guys 

 Bernice was caught between two young thugs, gripping her wrists, hurtling through the trees. When they slowed, she begged them to stop. She doubled up, sucking in a great lung-full of air. 

 "Come on, not far to go now!" Harry said, hurrying her up, with a slap to her bare ass. 

 Being reminded she wore just a thong, was bad enough. Having this young lout take such a liberty with her body, was too much. "Don't do that again! Or you'll be in trouble," she protested. 

 "Just like you snotty girls! Saint Bernadette's is such an uppity school," Harry chuckled. 

 "So, in your school, the girls don't complain when you are rude?" Bernice arrogantly asked. 

 "Not when they're bent over, showing off a bare ass," he laughed, and the others joined in laughing at her. 

 "Where are you taking me?" she asked, quickly changing the subject. 

 "If you don't want to join us, go back," he teased. 

 Bernice looked around, unsure of where 'back' was. With a hopeless sense of direction she would wander around in circles forever. What would a real schoolgirl do? She tried to think like an eighteen year old, but it was impossible. It seemed so long ago, so much had happened, since university. The last few years had changed her, made her responsible, less reckless. 

 "OK! Whatever," she said. The casual shrug of her shoulders, belied the qualms she felt, over being led deeper into the woods. These young guys were harmless enough, despite looking a bit rough. She felt able to handle them, without too much difficulty. 

 Without warning, an awful thought popped into her head. On arriving, where ever it was supposed to be, she might be expected to actually handle them. The idea of taking each of them in hand, having to play with their cocks, was terrible. Her imagination intensified the scene. 

 *** 

 It was either play with their cocks, or be left out in the wild. Once she started pulling the first guy off, it was a short step to pushing her face onto it. Rubbing his cock over her face the lad plucked up enough courage, to shove his cock into her mouth. Seeing this, all his friends wanted a blow job. 

 Having to suck eight young cocks had her reduced to a sperm slut. She was soon covered in their young virile, sticky juices. At only eighteen they were fit and randy. By the time she finished the last one, the first was ready for her again. Only this time, he wanted her pussy. 

 *** 

 Bernice looked around at the young guys, checking them out for bulges in their pants. They had taken a good look at her ass, and made nasty jokes about it, and what they wanted to do to it. Now though, they were more interested in getting deeper into the forest, away from the well trodden paths. 

 Harry offered his hand and she tool hold of it. As they touched, a little spark of static shocked her. He had a firm grip, so at least she wouldn't become lost. He was a handsome young man. He wasn't muscle bound, but walked tall and proud with a long step. He had a cute bottom too. 

 When they got to a clearing, there was a park ranger waiting for them, in a jeep. 

 "Hi Sid, how you doin?" Harry asked. 

 "I'm here because someone complained that you ran off with his niece. That you Barbara?" Sid asked. 

 "Err, I guess so," she quietly answered. It was a good ploy, she thought. Her husband hadn't much chance to stop them, as it happened all too quickly. At least he had thought to cover up their game, for it would be highly embarrassing to be found out. Since being dragged off into the forest, it would be even more uncomfortable to be discovered. 

 "I can give you a ride home, if you want," Sid offered. "Your uncle will be there waiting," he added. 

 "She's OK. We'll see Barbara gets home," Harry interrupted. 

 She looked from one to the other. She didn't want to be with either of them. Getting out of a rangers vehicle outside her home, while dressed like this, would be hard to explain to nosey neighbours. On the other hand, she could manipulate these young guys, and sneak home after dark. 

 "I'm fine, like, I'll stay, for awhile, OK?" she asked. It was embarrassing, pretending to be an adolescent in front of this man. Hiding her face in long hair was becoming a useful habit. 

 "Sure. It's up to you," Sid shrugged. "See you around guys. If you are thinking of starting a camp fire, don't! Understood?" he warned. 

 The gang made the right kinds of noises, while Sid climbed back into the jeep. 

 "You hungry, Barbara?" Harry asked. 

 "Yea, a burger would be good," she teased. 

 Being called Barbara, released her into becoming a new person. She had already been forced to act like an adolescent, now she had a name to go with the performance. It made it easier to behave badly when they didn't know who she was, and had less expectations of her. She felt happy to hide behind the new personality of Barbara. 

 "I've got a salami sandwich for you," one of them said, raising a leering laugh from the others. 

 "Sure, that sounds nice and tasty, but you haven't got enough to satisfy me," she teased, right back at him. 

 "What about a squirrel burger? What a look! Only joking! There's a burger bar near by. You'll have to change though," he said. 

 "Into what?" she replied, with a grimace. 

 They should have been treating her like a lady; with the respect an older woman was due. Instead they were treating her like a slut, and she couldn't help responding to it. The way she was dressed, and the way she felt, made it difficult to react any differently. 

 He pointed up, into the tree. "In the tree house, there's a change of clothes. We don't wear school uniforms like you lot, but sometimes it's useful to change. We sometimes sleep here, or just need to hang out. We built it years ago, when we were just kids," Harry said. 

 Bernice gave him a look of derision, when he referred to them as kids in the past tense. They were only just eighteen, and still looked like kids to her. She realised her face was marked with dirt, as well as her knees, and she was dressed young too. It was no wonder they treated her like a girl around their age. 

 The others busied themselves, bringing down a rope ladder. 

 "A pair of jeans and t-shirt would be cool," he suggested. 

 To her they were just kids, but she had dropped into feeling like one of them. Bernice would welcome a pair of jeans, to replace the impractical short skirt. She looked up at the ladder in trepidation. 

 "You can change down here if you prefer," Harry teased. 

 His friends told him girls can't climb, and ridiculed her. While two of them said they would help her change, if she couldn't climb. 

 "I'll pick what to wear, and change up there, thank you," she sternly told them. 

 Gripping the rope, she hefted herself up two rungs then eased herself up the next. "Shit!" she sighed. They were blatantly looking up the skirt, making rude comments. She tried to keep her legs together while climbing, but it was impossible. 

 They kept up a running commentary, as each foot stretched up to the next rung, splitting her legs. Showing off her bare bottom was doing something to her. "Not now!" she quietly chided herself. She didn't want her pussy swelling out of the little panties, with this mob checking her out. 

 "Hey, like, stop it guys, I need to concentrate," she said, and looked down at them. Her head seemed to come off her shoulders. An instant later she was upside down, swinging by her ankles. 

 She didn't need telling to hold on. Everyone was shouting at once. Harry climbed up to her, while others gripped the ladder, so it didn't shake around. Her upside down face was level with his. It was weird looking into his upside down eyes. He kissed her lips. 

 "Hey, like, now isn't the time or place, guy," she complained. 

 "You haven't even thanked me for rescuing you in the park. Now I have to untangle you, before you fall on your head," he argued back at her. 

 "Well, OK! Thanks, thanks for sticking me up a tree," she demurely said, meaning it to be sarcasm. 

 "So, do I get a kiss, or do you want to be a bat all night?" he teased her. 

 "OK! Like, make it quick," she grudgingly agreed. 

 He kissed her neck, then her ears. She meant to complain, but she was stuck there, holding on for her life. He kissed her lips, and her mouth opened, of its own accord, accepting his exploration. 

 Bernice groaned. This was too good. The earlier playing around, followed by a let down, combined with an exciting escape through the woods, was getting to her. She was far from losing control, but the helplessness of her position was working on her. 

 "Phew! You're, like, some kisser!" she sighed. He looked embarrassed. He climbed up further, to untangle her ankles. Carefully placing his feet, to avoid stepping on her hand, he raised himself level with her crotch. 

 She looked up at him, seeing what he could see, and became highly embarrassed. The skirt had fallen down over her hips, revealing the brief panties. His face was inches away from them. All his friends could see her panties! They could all see him staring right between her legs! Her breathing became ragged, no longer from fear, but from arousal. 

 "Nice!" he commented while examining her. "The panties look cheap. Is what's inside them cheap too?" he asked. 

 "That's rude," she retaliated, only her voice sounded too weak to put him off. 

 "Calling your panties cheap or what's inside them?" he laughed. 

 "Both! Anyway, like, they aren't cheap," she said, trying to sound miffed. 

 "So what's inside these panties has a price, and it isn't cheap," he asked. 

 "No! You know that's not what I meant. I meant my panties," she shouted a him. Hell he had her discussing her panties, while his friends laughed at her. Bernice was becoming more fired up than ever. 

 She felt humiliated from telling him her pussy wasn't cheap or at least, that was what his friends were laughing at. He had tricked her into saying her pussy wasn't cheap and they thought it hilarious. She had called herself a whore as far as they were concerned and kept guessing at how much she charged. 

 It was just a nasty tease, but she could take it. It became infuriating as they kept on. 

 "Shut up! What's in my knickers ain't cheap, so you lot can't afford it, OK!" she shouted at them. 

 They laughed nervously, and settled down to murmuring amongst themselves. She just hoped the unintentional outburst hadn't started something nasty. 

 Moving his foot from a rung, Harry found her hand on the next one. Before he put his weight on her hand, he pulled the foot away, and nearly fell. His swung forward and his face slapped her right between the legs. 

 Bernice winced and yelped. She dare not move though. 

 "Sorry," he said. "Perhaps I should kiss it better," he suggested. 

 "No!" she shouted. 

 Unable to defend herself, and being dependent upon him to free her, she kept quiet. She hoped he would move on, if she didn't make a big deal over it. Instead, she watched him move in. His lips puckered up, ready to suck at her lips. She groaned in anguish and from arousal. The thought of what he was about to do, was enough to have her gasping. 

 Already aroused, this young guy was stoking her up, beyond the limits of control. She didn't want him, or anyone else, to touch her there. She couldn't even pull her thighs together, with her ankles caught in the rope ladder. 

 It was difficult to know, if she was more afraid of him, or of falling. It wasn't him she was afraid of, it was what she might do, once aroused. He pulled away the panty crotch with his teeth. His strong mouth covered her lips. They pressed heavily upon her sex, engulfing it. 

 She needed to tell him that she wasn't a silly girl, she was a responsible woman. She was a mature, married woman, and he must stop doing those lovely things to her. 

 The more deeply he kissed her the more his friends cheered. The more they cheered the more excited she became. She trembled like a leaf. She heard herself groaning with passion. It was so very wrong, yet she couldn't do a thing about it. The whole situation, and everything leading up to it, had her submitting to this young lad. 

 He sucked her lips into his mouth, bit on them then let go. She was on the verge of an orgasm when he stopped. 

 "What are you doing to me?" she cried out. 

 Mistaking her question, he told her. "Tying your ankles to this rope, to haul you up," he explained. 

 She was asking why he had taken her so close then suddenly stopped. Her mind was full of arousal. When he untangled her ankles she dropped a few inches, forcing a yell from her lips. He climbed over her, the hardness in his jeans rubbing over her face. It pressed against her sex as he climbed. Her panties caught and were dragged up around her knees. 

 The crowd below her cheered, making comments about how wet and open the slut was. She should have died of shame. Instead she was caught in a state of excitement, losing touch with everything but her sex. The dreadful state she was in meant the lewd comments stoked her up. 

 From the tree house, he pulled her up by the rope, tied around her ankles. He grabbed a hold of her arm pits and heaved her in. She sat panting on the floor, with her legs ether side of his. 

 Bernice was breathing fiercely, sucking great gulps of air. The fear added to her arousal, pushing her into becoming submissive. She could feel the familiar docile state, taking her over. She didn't want to be like that, in such a dangerous situation, yet it was impossible to fight the condition. 

 "That's the second time I've rescued you. I claim my reward," he demanded, with a light laugh, playing around his mouth. His eyes were intense, staring at her, judging her. He was trying to decide how far she would go. 

 She nodded, unable to speak. She could at least let him kiss her, that wouldn't do any harm. 

 He pulled her over his lower body. He dragged down the zip, and pulled out his cock. He pushed her face onto it, and rolled it over her lips. Without thinking, she opened her mouth, and sucked it in. 

 She couldn't stop herself. She licked and sucked, making a meal of it. It was a surprise when he cum. He spurted hot sperm into her mouth, tasting acrid and salty. There seemed to be loads of it! She assumed he had produced so much, because he was a young, virile man. She swallowed and gulped, not wanting to, only what else was she to do with it? 

 He kept his cock firmly pressed in her mouth, until at last he let her go. 

 She lay still on the floor, wondering what in hell had happened. She had just sucked off a complete stranger. She was still on the edge of an orgasm, trying to bring herself under control. She wanted to shout at him, but for what? It wasn't his fault he was treating her like a common little slut. She looked like one, and behaved like one. 

 He went to kiss her then pulled back from her, with a look of disgust. He fingered a drop of cum, from the corner of her mouth, and wiped it onto her parted lips. She had wanted him to kiss her, to receive some kind of affection. To have that need rejected, pushed her firmly in place, as a dirty little slut. 

 "Come on, I'll help you down," he said. 

 She was being summarily dismissed, by this young guy. He had used her to suck his cock dry, and was finished with. 

 "What about me? You've had what you want, what about my needs?" Bernice petulantly asked. She was angry, yet the words were driven by a deep need for satisfaction. She knew it, yet hadn't been able to hold them back. 

 "The guys can fuck you, if that's what you want!" Harry dismissively told her. 

 He was defining her place, more foully than she could take. In a fit of anger she retaliated. "Maybe I will," she spat at him. The thought of taking his friends on was painfully depraved, though being so sexed up, it was almost possible. Never before had she been so worked up, and so out of control. 

 "These jeans are too long for you. I'll make them into cut-offs. Here, grab a shirt," he said, throwing it at her. Most of the buttons were missing, but she couldn't bring herself to ask for another. The pile of old clothes looked dirty and worn. With shaking hands she undid the buttons on the blouse. 

 She didn't try to hide her body from him as she pulled off the top. She couldn't help making a show of it. She tied the shirt under her breasts, noting how much cleavage was on show, yet defiantly not caring. 

 He passed her the shorts. She looked around for her panties. Not seeing them, she pulled the shorts up under the skirt. The crotch of the shorts pressed against her sex, confirming how wet she was down there. 

 Abandoning the blouse and skirt, among the pile of dirty old clothes, she stood ready to descend. 

 It hadn't been such a good idea to get changed after all. Especially not up here, with him. Had she thought these ruffians would have a selection of designer clothes up here? If they had stolen them they might have. The clothes she wore now were worse than the school uniform. They were old and dirty, reinforcing the feeling of being a dirty slut. 

 They said nothing, as he eased her down the ladder. He pressed close against her in case she fell. He wasn't angry with her, for she had simply been used and dismissed. His friends were at last quiet; guessing the two of them had sex up there. 

 Once on firm ground, they were bemused by the antagonism she showed toward him. It was obvious they had sex, rather than making love, and she didn't seem pleased about it. 

 Bernice tried to adjust the shorts. They rode low over her hips and were cut high up her thighs. He had hacked at them with a penknife, leaving little material remaining. After pulling them about, she realised there was nothing to adjust. 

 The thin strip of material at her crotch wasn't enough to conceal everything. The material pulled between her lips, leaving just the fluffy, ragged cotton, to flutter over her sex. Her lips were just about covered, as long as the ragged material didn't fray anymore. 

 The top half of her bum was covered, but there wasn't anything she could do about the rest. Her cheeks rudely bulged out the back of the shorts. The tight fit cut her in two, riding up between her cheeks, only just covering her asshole. 

 The way the guys stared at her made her angry. The aggressive arousal was new to her. It wavered between wanting to angrily dare them to make a move, and a need to surrender. She caught herself staring at their crotch, looking for signs of their readiness to take her. She felt an urge to tease them, wanting to dare them, needing them to take her. She also experienced a strong contrary desire, to simply submit to them. 

 Her head was drowning, as she swam in a pool of sexual arousal. Bernice followed them out of the clearing along a path, not knowing, not caring where they took her. 

 In a burger bar they sat happily slurping coke, and munching beef. The blanched onions crunched, annoying Harry. It sent shivers through him. He was wound up enough to storm over to the server and argue with him. The others didn't take any notice, not caring what it was about. 

 "Over here!" Harry offhandedly said, while crooking a finger at Bernice. 

 She hesitated from moving, after being so derisorily summoned. Meaning to rebuke him for being so curt, she got up and walked toward Harry. She swung her hips seductively, and was rewarded by a look of lust from the young server. The guy ogled her figure so blatantly she felt a wave of desire wash over her, defeating the anger. 

 A shiver ran down her spine, on realising this nerdy looking guy had aroused her. He was just as greasy as the burgers he sold. He stood with a stoop, perhaps from leaning over a grill for too long. His lank dark hair, stuck to his head, in an unfashionable, short back and sides cut.

She must be desperate, to be aroused by such an unlikely specimen of manhood. Standing next to harry, the poor fellow didn't have a chance in hell. 

 She knew better than to tease them, for it was too dangerous. She was behaving like a sexy slut, and the more they responded, the more it dragged her into the role. The game had often been played, with her husband, in the safety of their bedroom. Here, in public, it was so very wrong. Being dressed like a stupid slut, and treated like one, shouldn't have made her into one. It seemed her husband was right. When aroused past a certain point, she lost control. 

 It was important to get away from them, and to somehow get home. 

 "Joe has agreed to take you in exchange for the meal," Harry informed her. 

 Her mouth dropped open. The expression on her face clouded darkly, with a storm warning, readying for a harsh announcement. Her lips flapped, unable to express the indignation she felt. How could they possibly treat her so badly? 

 Her hips moved back and forth, as though she were being humped, up against a wall. This slight movement betrayed how she really felt, behind the facade of anger. 

 Bernice tried to complain only her voice was dry. Being given away for a few burgers and bottles of soda, was the worst humiliation to strike in all her life. So demeaning was it, her mind couldn't cope. She was a sophisticated business woman, being given away by a callous youth, for food. 

 In business she had easily and abruptly, dealt with unwelcome advances. Customers sometimes tried it on, just before the signing of a substantial contract. Especially when the figures were so substantial, they thought they deserved something extra from her. 

 Now she was expected to fuck for food! It appalled her, yet the dire humiliation excited her. 

 "You work the rest of the shift, cleaning tables and washing up," Harry informed her. 

 "Oh!" Bernice murmured. She felt foolish. The arousal was still there, working away at her, heating her crotch. She thought the fringing, hiding her pussy, might catch fire any moment. 

 Harry was surprised she gave in so easily. He joined his friends, to hang around until the last drip of soda had been sipped. After all they had nowhere to go or do. 

 When they left in a loud, boisterous group, she became frightened. It seemed terrible to be abandoned. Left there working for this ugly looking guy, left her feeling as though she was at his mercy. She wanted to shout at them to take her along. As bad as it seemed, she wanted to tell them, she was their sexy slut, 'so please take me with you'. 

 Joe was working until ten, when he would close up as usual. It was only seven, yet he would already be clock watching. This evening he couldn't take his eyes off the beautiful woman working for him. What a body! 

 She couldn't blame him for she was flaunting it. Not just because the clothes were so brief, it was the way she moved. She couldn't do much about the clothes, so she would have to cool down, needing her behaviour to return to normal. Otherwise, she would be in serious trouble. 

 "You can go clean the tables. Put the cardboard and paper in the trash can. Bring back the plates and glasses to wash them," he told her. He explained what to do as though she were a dumb bitch. With her mind in turmoil, unable to think straight, she was acting like one. 

 There were few customers, but walking among the tables, left her feeling vulnerable in the brief shorts and skimpy top. It was obvious she wore nothing underneath. The guys stared, and the girls glared. 

 She felt him squeeze by her yet again. Despite there being enough room he pressed her against the sink. This time he gently rubbed up against her bottom. She was ready for him. She looked over her shoulder, ready to tell him off. Instead a more urgent request came to mind. 

 "Can I ask you something?" Bernice asked, putting on a helpless, girly voice. She had firmly sunk into the persona of Barbara, the sexy slut. 

 "Sure!" he shot back at her. He grinned with a wild look of pleasure plastered across his face. The slut hadn't pushed him away or shouted at his immature advances. She looked so hot, he couldn't help interpreting everything she said and did, as a come-on. 

 "Could I earn the cab fare home, please?" she asked. The sweetness of her voice would gain anything she wanted. She felt him press a little more firmly against her rear. She should have told him off, instead she sweetly smiled. She understood what she was doing to him, but couldn't hold back. 

 There had probably been more attractive girls walking into this greasy joint at some time or another, but they would have ignored him. Bernice was attractive, way above his standard, yet he had her working for him. He could hardly keep his hands off her. 

 This knowledge didn't help her calm down. She was still hot, still needing a man, still wanting to submit. She was trying to fight the need to be treated like a sexy slut. The mischievous thought reverberated through her head. She wanted to tell him she wasn't Barbara, the sexy slut, but the words caught in her throat. 

 She rolled her head around on her shoulders, trying to get rid of the tension. She bent forward over the sink, dipping her hands in the washing up water. She was trying to dismiss him from her thoughts, but he was still there. 

 When he pushed against her she pushed back, meaning to push him away, only he was too strong. As he pushed her forward against the sink, she felt his cock pressing against her bottom. 

 "Oh! No! We can't," she stuttered. 

 He ignored the weak protest. Joe rubbed his cock against the bare cheeks, protruding from the shorts. 

 Bernice looked up, finding they were hidden behind a small, cardboard advertising sign. It sat on the counter, hiding them from view. As humiliating as it might be, to let him take her over the sink in a greasy burger bar, she was aching for it. 

 In frustration, she lifted up on her toes and rubbed her bare cheeks over his hardness. His cock felt so hard and hot against her bare flesh. She pushed back on him, catching his cock in the crease of her bottom. The friction against the thin cotton at her crotch, was rubbing her up the right way. 

 Breathing heavily through her open mouth, she tried not to make any noise. There weren't many in the down market place, but an audience of one would be too many. 

 She felt him push between her thighs then lift. Her whole body was lifted up, to balance on her hands, and his cock. He grabbed her cheeks, pushing her into place, manoeuvring past the crotch of her shorts. 

 She sank back onto her feet, by sliding down the length of his cock. She gasped when it forcefully hit the neck of her womb. He was so deep inside her she thought she might choke. It felt as though he had filled her entire body with his cock. 

 She had eaten cum earlier, but needed a cock to fill her up, to orgasm properly. She wasn't thinking about that, she was thinking about being filled. It was so bad she was past caring who did it to her, just so long as she had a cock. She looked like a slut, behaved like a slut, and this proved without doubt, she was a dirty, sexy slut. 

 "Fuck me hard," she whispered, over her shoulder. 

 "OK! You want it, I've got it," he told her. 

 She cringed at his words. Little should be expected from a stupid young guy, working in a cheap burger bar. He was working her body now, and doing a good job of it, just so long as he kept his mouth shut. 

 He lifted her up off the ground a couple of times, while slamming away at her. Every deep penetration brought a feeling of euphoria. "Yes!" she hissed, when he reached so deep into her body, it felt as though he was taking her over. Her head flopped forward, until he pulled back. 

 She felt his cock rubbing over her clit, as he dragged it back. Her head lifted, with eyes wide open, anticipating the forward thrust and a satisfying, deep penetration. He wouldn't last much longer, and knew it would trigger her orgasm too. 

 Lifting her head, like a nodding donkey, her eyes grew wide. This time her eyes grew large with astonishment. A man had pushed aside the small cardboard barrier. He was smiling at her. The amusement on his face didn't mollify her fear. He could see perfectly what she was doing. 

 He put a finger under her chin, holding her head up from its usual dip. She couldn't tear her eyes away from his. The struggle behind her was being resolved. She felt his whole body stiffen, as he started pumping sperm into her vagina. The man still held her chin, and her gaze. 

 Her mouth flapped trying to announce she was about to cum. She dare not say it. The man knew anyway. He was watching the guy behind her thrust in deep, where he finally held his cock motionless, right up inside her. 

 The tremors sprayed out from her stomach, reaching her hands and feet, and swamping her head with lightning shocks. The man smiled at her. That smile told her he knew what she was doing and what was happening to her. He was so close he shared the intimacy with her, as though it was he that fucked her, and made her cum. 

 This was the second time she had an audience to an orgasm today. It didn't make it any easier. Still staring at him, she began to realise she had seen him somewhere before. His face was only inches away from hers, so she hadn't focused on it. Besides, she had been busy up till now. 

 This man worked for a consultancy business she had hired. Shit! He would start on Monday, looking over her business, preparing to give advice on expansion. Here he was, staring at her, studying her, while she calmed down from an orgasm. 

 He had watched her being fucked by this greasy young guy! She tried to look away, only he held her chin, forcing her to look at him, while he appraised her. His face revealed what he thought of her. To him she was a dirty little slut. In her own head, she was exactly that. 

 In self defence, her mind hid behind the persona of Barbara, the young, sexy slut. She desperately needed to be Barbara, the only way of escaping this sordid situation.

Chapter 03 

 Bernice is ensnared 

 While bent over the sink in a cheap burger bar, a young guy had taken advantage of her. So worked up from what happened with a gang of boys in the forest, she had given in. While she recovered from the orgasm, he wiped his mess from between her legs with an old dish cloth. She had been used, and put in her place as his stupid young waitress. 

 As humiliating as it was, Bernice had to ask the young guy for cab fare. It would be impossible walking home dressed like a slut. Besides, anything could happen on a long walk in the dark, as she had already found out this afternoon. 

 "You promised!" Bernice retaliated. 

 "When you've finished the shift. That was the arrangement with Harry, to pay for the burgers and drinks. Unless you want paying for the fuck," Joe smirked. 

 How could she agree to that! It would downgrade her from a dirty slut to a whore. It was difficult to think of herself as a responsible business woman, after letting him take her and the way she had behaved. 

 She dare not think about her husband either, or she might crumple on the floor in a sobbing heap. She had to find some way to get through this. She would have to carry on pretending to be Barbara, the gullible young slut. 

 Walking from behind the counter to serve customers, she could feel the fraying cotton of the cut off jeans, digging at her crotch. There had been little enough holding them in place, and with every step it seemed they were parting. 

 The steam from the washing up, together with sweat, plastered the little top to her breasts. It was all the more imperative to switch off from what she was, to escape the indignity. As Barbara the slut, it was just possible to carry on. 

 "I'll have another strawberry shake," a guy said. He was ogling her body, while the girlfriend looked daggers at her. The anger turned to a derisory sneer. 

 Bernice wanted to run and hide, though as Barbara it was possible to withstand the embarrassment. She waggled her hips from side to side, as she wrote down the order. In retaliation to the girlfriends look of rudeness, she smiled at the boy. 

 They were only eighteen, so they should have given her the respect a mature woman deserved. With a baby faced complexion and her hair tied in pig-tails, they thought she was a teenager. Dressed like a slut, she received an admiring look from the boy, and a look of disdain from his girlfriend. 

 Returning to the counter she wiggled her ass, feeling the cheeks bulging out of the tight jeans. Annoying the girlfriend was her only chance to get back at everyone who pushed her into this degrading situation. 

 Fetching a shake, she carefully placed it on the table with exaggerated care. Leaning over the boyfriend showed off a deep cleavage, with the darkness of her nipples on display. 

 "I like the wet t-shirt idea," the boy broadly smiled. His girlfriend dug him sharply in the ribs. 

 "I was only being friendly!" he complained. 

 "Don't encourage the slut," she crossly told him. "You, leave him alone, slut," she warned. The sound of her voice was a feral growl. 

 Somewhat satisfied from having wound-up the girlfriend, Bernice wiggled her way to another table. 

 "What time do you close?" Paul asked. 

 Looking over her shoulder, she sighed with relief. "Fifteen minutes," Bernice replied. 

 "I'll just have a coffee," he said, with a deep penetrating voice. 

 Only then looking at the man, she realised who it was. He was the consultant hired to advise her on raising capital, for a business expansion. He had witnessed that nasty session behind the counter, with the greasy haired boy. He had watched her orgasm! 

 At least he didn't know who she was. On Monday she would wear plenty of make- up, and dress in an expensive business suit. She just hoped he wouldn't remember her being here. She imagined him in the conference room, trying to figure out where he had seen her before. She almost broke down in a fit of nervous giggles. 

 This time walking back to the counter she couldn't sway her hips, for it seemed so rude in front of him. 

 The crotch of the tight shorts was cutting her in two. The frayed cotton at the crotch was down to a few threads, and was perilously close to parting. From the moment she pulled them on, her cheeks crudely bulged from them. During the short time she wore them, her lips were becoming more prominent. She just hoped it would hold together until the burger bar closed. 

 At last it was time to close up for the evening. She watched a couple of the guys leave a generous tip, only for the girlfriends to snatch the notes from the table. They gave her a farewell sneer, while the boyfriends looked longingly at her, before being dragged out the door. 

 "That's it. You can turn the closed sign on your way out," Joe offhandedly told her. 

 "What about the taxi fare?" Bernice asked, in dismay. 

 "You earned the bill for the gangs burgers and drinks. That's it, unless you want to whore for it," Joe taunted her. "I'm about ready for a blow job," he leered. 

 She was about to ask how she was going to get home dressed like a slut. To him she was just that, a dirty slut, so what was the problem. Unable to bring herself to answer him, she strode to the door purposely not switching the sign to closed, and left. It was a pathetic protest, yet all she could think of. After all, the whole afternoon and evening she left acting pathetically. 

 She should have taken control of the situation from that first moment, when being dragged off into the forest by those boys. It had all happened so quickly. At the time all she could think of was avoiding a scene. The last thing she wanted was to be discovered dressed as a schoolgirl. It had been a daring adventure with her husband, which rapidly degenerated into a disaster. 

 Standing outside in the gloom, she wondered what to do. Hearing the locks clicking shut meant she couldn't go back in to plead for the fare. He wanted a blow job, and there was no chance of that! The lights flickered off, leaving her in the dark. There were no other stores, just that one cafe on the edge of the park. 

 It was either walk out the nearest exit, with a long walk home, or a short cut through the forest to the entrance she used earlier. She wished she had taken notice of the paths the gang had dragged her along. 

 A crackle of branches put her on high alert. Being attacked by a wild animal would end the worst of days ever experienced. 

 "Hey! Babs!" Harry called. 

 Although he started the dreadful events, she was relieved to hear his voice. He had meant well. He thought he was saving her from an old letch in the park, not knowing she was just playing a game with her husband. 

 "Hi Harry," she said, sounding full of relief. "I need my clothes, will you take me back to the tree house?" she asked, with a plaintive note to her voice. 

 "Sure! It's not far, but be careful in the dark, stick close to me," he encouraged. 

 Again he had that nice caring note in his voice. It won her around when they first met. At least now she had lost the heat of arousal, which earlier loosened her morals to a frightening degree. It was shocking to know how badly she behaved when hot. Now she knew, she was at least fore-warned. A defence would have to be worked out, against becoming so vulnerable. Her husband had teased her about it, only she thought he was joking. 

 Harry held her hand, to guide her along a narrow track. She stumbled in the dark, eventually making it to the familiar clearing. Looking up at the tree house, she remembered her wayward behaviour, and cringed. No wonder he treated her like a stupid slut. 

 Despite the rangers warning they had lit a fire. The glow threw wavering shadows of the boys sitting around a camp fire onto the trees. They were only adolescents, yet from their treatment of her earlier, she knew to be careful. 

 "I need my school uniform, could you get it for me?" she asked, trying to sound reasonable, yet firm. 

 "Why don't you come up with me," Harry playfully suggested. 

 "No. I'll wait here," Bernice said. There was no way she could possibly go through that again. 

 "Please yourself," Harry shrugged, and climbed the rope ladder. 

 He threw down the skirt and the top, which one of them caught. At least she could go back home dressed as she had left the house. It would be easier to explain to her husband why she had been so long. Of course, it would have taken some time to find her way out of the park, and he should be happy to see her at last. 

 Turning up dressed in the shorts and top would take some explaining. Especially when she was flaunting her body so crudely. She would have to be careful not to reveal she had lost her panties. Recounting what happened this afternoon certainly couldn't include everything. 

 "We need those clothes back," Jimmy leered at her, while holding onto the uniform. 

 She glowered at him, with hands on hips. It was certainly true, she could cope with this now she wasn't all fired up. The sound of the crackling wood broke the expectant silence while she stared him out. 

 "No! I paid for your burgers and drinks by working in that stinking burger bar. You owe me these trashy clothes. I'm not striping off in front of you lot," she angrily flung back at him. 

 The hush was broken by laughter. They were laughing at both of them. Their eyes were still on her. She could see the glow of excitement in their eyes, though their faces were in shadow. The light from the flames flickered, reflecting off her soft flesh. There was too much of it showing while in the company of a bunch of wild boys. 

 "Just a friendly kiss, and you can have the clothes," Jimmy suggested. 

 "Harry, I need to go," she said, as he landed at the foot of the ladder. 

 "That sounds like a fair deal. I'll have the kiss though," he defiantly told Jimmy. 

 After sucking his cock earlier in the tree house, a kiss didn't sound so bad. In comparison it sounded perfectly respectable. 

 "OK. Then you'll show me the way back to the gate!" she firmly stated. 

 "Deal," he smiled at her. 

 Although his face was in shadow she could tell he meant it. He wrapped his arms around her, to the approving sounds of his friends. The words weren't vulgar, they were encouraging. 

 He didn't just dive in for a smooch. He looked into her flame lit face. He smiled, while gently pulling her close. He kissed her forehead, a cheek, her nose, then sucked her upper lip between his, to nibble on it. In the firelight it was a romantic moment. 

 She was sweaty and smelly from the cafe, and had been a dreadful slut, leaving her feeling inadequate. She was undeserving of such gentle consideration. All the doubts of adolescence came flooding back, to leave her feeling nervous. He was a handsome young guy, leaving her feeling young and attractive. 

 When his tongue touched hers an electric shock of passion gripped her, as tight as his arms. His hands cupped her cheeks. It felt natural for him to take advantage, as she was lewdly flaunting her body. She was Barbara, the young slut he had saved. She felt so hot, her passion was deepening. 

 Warning bells were peeling, yet she couldn't help kissing, sucking, and twining her tongue with his. The duel went on, seemingly endlessly. She didn't hear the bawdy encouragement from his friends. His hands were exploring her body, with very little clothing protecting it. Her world had closed in to the small sensitive point of their teasing tongues. 

 Her body was on fire, as hot as the crackling wood. Her nerve cracked, and her mind sparked with passion. She was past the point of no return. Her legs felt weak, giving way as he lowered her to her knees. 

 She didn't want to see his cock, she wanted a romantic cuddle in front of the fire. She looked up at him with pleading eyes, trying to tell him not to spoil the moment. Instead, he eased his cock into her mouth. 

 Sinking into the role of Barbara the slut wasn't an option. She had to keep him happy or she would never find her way out of there. She knew it was an excuse. As bad as it was, her body was desperate and couldn't be refused. She needed satisfaction from a deep lustful craving. Instead of offering up her sex, she would have to make do with on with this. 

 As much as she wanted a cock between her legs, her head bobbed enthusiastically. It was taking too long. She was cooling down, beginning to recover her wits. Too late, she couldn't stop now. At last he spilled his load into her mouth. She spat it on the ground, with a grimace of disgust dribbling across her face. 

 The shame left her too weak to stand. She remained kneeling where he left her. Yet again he dismissed her, by turning his back after making use of her. She wondered if it was her, or had he some problem with what she had done. He had been so caring before. It left her feeling like a worthless slut, not worthy of his attention. 

 When another of the gang stepped in front of her, their voices came into focus. They were drawing lots to see who would be next. This boy had won her mouth, and a second was already lining up to take her! They were going to make use of her body, and keep her as a gang slut! 

 She was so empty of emotion, feeling so pathetic, she said nothing. It was impossible to defend her pride, for it had burnt away leaving an acrid taste of ashes. There was nothing left of her self-worth, as it had gone up in smoke. She knelt on the ground, prepared to endure the ordeal. 

 She heard them discussing her, saying that a slut like her wouldn't be able to grip tight with her pussy. Another of the gang suggested using her asshole. It was bound to be tight enough. 

 Their coarse remarks left her beaten into submission. She couldn't cry, or complain. They were wild adolescents and she had proven how debased she was. She opened her mouth ready to suck on the cock nudging her face. In dismay she realised how wrong she had been. A deep arousal still griped her body and thoughts, leaving her helpless to resist. 

 "Hey! What's going on! Stop that right now!" a man fiercely shouted. 

 He strode into the clearing. Up close he seemed to tower over her. She couldn't see who it was, and didn't want to. He grabbed an arm, forcing her up off the ground onto shaking legs. Seeing her school uniform on the ground he scooped it up, and dragged her away. 

 The gang slunk back, thinking the stranger must be her father. 

 A torch lit the path, only she saw nothing through tear filled eyes. The shame of being found like that numbed her mind. 

 Trotting along, keeping up with his long strides, meant it didn't take as long returning to the cafe parking lot. Again she was led by the hand, making her feel like a naughty little girl. He didn't ask, he just opened the car door expecting her to get in. Once in she felt weak and numb, as though from running a marathon. 

 She dare not look at him, but recognised the voice. 

 Paul drove off, watching her out of the corner of his eye. She looked shamefaced with head down, looking as though about to shrink to nothing. 

 Bernice squirmed in the seat, wondering what frightful situation she was in now. At least he had saved her from herself. She couldn't blame the boys. She had been up for it, so they were just helping themselves to a willing victim. 

 Feeling the cotton finally give way, she sat perfectly still. The only thing covering her pussy was a flap of denim! Getting into the car had pulled the crotch until just a strand kept it together. Now that had given up the fight to hold her swollen lips in place. 

 There was no mistaking her state of arousal. That it was from the prospect of becoming a gang whore was unforgivable. Playing at being Barbara the slut, couldn't be blamed. It was her mouth that had been splashed with a strangers cum. It was her, preparing to take on that rough gang of adolescents. 

 "Home? Where to?" Paul asked. 

 "No! I can't go home like this," she whined. She trembled in anguish at the thought of her husband seeing her like this. A hotel was out of the question, even if she had the money. 

 "Your parents will be worried about you," Paul stated. 

 After awhile she answered. "They're away," she lied. 

 "I had better make sure you don't get into trouble, AGAIN!" he emphasised. 

 Sitting there with her pussy bare and everything else on show, she felt disgusted with herself. Her knees were caked in dirt and probably the rest of her bare flesh was filthy too. She felt as though she was just a dirty little schoolgirl, being told off by an adult. 

 Being caught having sex with an adolescent for a second time by this man, was too much to bear. She felt broken, and irreparable. 

 "Sorry. I'm so sorry, sir," she whispered. 

 "You had better spend the night at my apartment, until your parents get home," he told her. "You can't be trusted to be left alone," he added. 

 He knew she was lying to him. From the start he hadn't intended to take her home. He figured she would be afraid of going home, and not because of trouble from parents. They said nothing more on the journey. 

 *** 

 "Stand there and don't move," he ordered. 

 He settled into his favourite armchair. He let her stand before him while he studied the dishevelled woman. 

 Every part of her body had smears of dirt over it, especially her knees. Tracks from tears ran down her face, through the dust and wood smoke. She smelt of sweat, stale burgers, and burnt wood. Her hair was a mess, and what little she was wearing was falling off. 

 She looked like a tomboy after playing in the woods all day. 

 "You've sperm on your face. Don't touch it, or you'll spill it on the carpet. You'll wash in a moment," he told her. 

 The bachelor pad was clean and minimalistic, though richly decorated. She recognised some of the artists paintings on the walls, and an elegant bronze of a naked woman. They were expensive pieces of art. He was obviously unmarried, to be able to indulge such a hobby. 

 She kept her head down, trying to hide her face in long hair. After this she wouldn't dare meet him on Monday. Some excuse would have to be thought of, to cancel his consulting services. 

 At the moment she was standing before him like a naughty little girl. The feeling was overpowering, and he was making it all the more difficult. She felt he was justified, after what would have happened if he hadn't saved her. 

 When he pointed out there was cum on her face, she nearly collapsed with shame. She dare not reveal who she was, so the persona of Barbara the slut would have to be endured for awhile longer. 

 Surely he wasn't going to take advantage of her. Did it matter, after all that had been endured already. 

 "The school uniform will have to be washed. Like you its caked in dirt," he said. 

 She looked around for it. 

 "It's in the laundry room. I'll get you something more suitable to wear. You can't go home like that. What would your parents say?" he asked. 

 "Don't know," she whispered. 

 "Don't know? I imagine they would be shocked. You've been running around without panties. Those shorts are tight enough to reveal almost everything, and what they should be covering is on public view," he scolded her. 

 He had to suppress a laugh from the way she squirmed like a schoolgirl before the principal. 

 "As for your despicable behaviour with those boys, I'm shocked. Your parents should throw you out of the house. Are you ashamed of yourself?" he asked. 

 "Yes, sir, sorry sir," she whimpered. 

 She wanted to plead with him not to tell her parents, despite them having passed away several years ago. Besides, it would be just as bad if he took her home to face her husband. She sank further into the role of Barbara, the bad slut. 

 "You're a filthy little girl, and I don't want you polluting my apartment. You had better get showered and freshened up. I'll get some clothes for you. My cousin sometimes stays over, so maybe she's left something that will fit. I can't say you deserve decent clothes, after what I witnessed of your disgusting behaviour," Paul said, laying it on heavily.  

 

 

===

"Yes, sir, thank you sir," she demurely answered. 

 "Run along then. Keep that thing between your legs covered in future. It isn't supposed to be given away so cheaply," he admonished her. 

 Bernice glanced in the direction of his pointing finger, and slunk off. She had been standing before him trying to keep her pussy covered. Every scathing remark was deserved. She felt like a low form of life, scraped off his shoe. What he said to her was so very true, and so very bad. 

 The shower was scolding hot, yet nothing could scour away the feelings of being nothing more than a dirty little bitch. The prospect of a full night of sleep didn't hold much hope either. Her father had always said, a night's rest would set things right by morning. She wondered if she could sleep with thoughts of this dreadful day buzzing through her head. Dare she sleep with the possibility of terrifying nightmares? 

 "Wrap a towel around you, and go into the bedroom opposite," Paul shouted through the door, after hearing the shower stop. 

 His voice made her jump. She pulled the door open a crack, to see him returning to the lounge. She scampered into the room opposite. Laid out on the bed was clothing, as promised. It seemed she was too filthy a slut for him to take advantage of. It was both a relief, and another put down. 

 Pulling on the dress, she found it was too large. It made her feel like a little girl trying on a big sisters clothes. The A-Line dress flared out from below her bust, to swirl around her knees. There was no bra, so maybe he thought she didn't need one. She pulled on the big white panties, hoping they would stay up. 

 As near as ready as it was possible to be, she timidly walked into the lounge. 

 "I'm in here," his voice shouted from the kitchen. "I'll make you something to eat. Anything your allergic to? Go find out how the washing machine works. The maid won't be in until Monday, and you'll need your school uniform," he told her. 

 She stood by the table waiting for permission to sit down. He just used the one word, 'sit', so she sat, and picked up the sandwich. The Ardennes pate was meaty and tangy. She would have liked a Rich Burgundy to go with it, only he provided lemonade, with a straw. Trying to be a good little girl, she ate and drank without fuss. 

 "Thank you sir. I don't deserve your kindness," she modestly spoke. 

 "You look sorry for yourself, and so you should. Just put the dishes in the washer, and come into the lounge, when everything is clean and tidy. You can do that without breaking anything, can't you?" he asked. 

 "Yes, sir, thank you sir," she respectfully replied. 

 She walked in to stand before him, trying to look like a reformed character. Shaking off Barbara might not take too long, though recovering her self-worth would take far longer, if ever. 

 "I didn't hear breaking plates. Did you do a thorough cleaning job?" he asked. 

 "Yes, sir, honest sir," she said, trying for an appeasing sincerity. She meant to please him, as she needed to make amends to someone. 

 "Shall I take you home and tell your parents what I know?" he asked. 

 "Please, sir, no, sir," she whined. She gave him her best little girl lost expression, designed to gain his acceptance. One foot was crossed over the other, as she struck a gouache girly pose. 

 "You need punishing, to fix in that silly head of yours how to behave properly. If you won't allow your parents to do it, then I will," he sternly said. 

 "Yes, sir," is all she could say. He was right, she deserved punishing for what happened out there. It was all her fault, with no one else to blame. She had flaunted her body, and behaved badly. She looked down at the plush carpet, to see a tear drop soak into it. 

 "Come here," he demanded. He tapped his knees, and was satisfied to see her bend over them. She squirmed into place, until folded over his lap. 

 "This will hurt. You ready for a spanking?" he asked. 

 "Yes, sir," she bravely answered. 

 He lifted the back of the dress. Pulled at the large white panties, for them to fall around her ankles. Feeling them slither down her legs, she whimpered. 

 Smack! The sound of a hard hand striking her soft fleshy bottom was a shock. The stinging hurt was more so. She steeled herself to suffering an undignified spanking, knowing it was fully deserved. Barbara the slut was being reduced to a repentant little girl. So was Bernice, the important business woman. 

 Another hard slap rocked her cheeks. This time she yelped from the pain. One after another the smacks shook her body. She tried not to squirm, even though her cheeks felt so painful. She locked both thumbs together to prevent covering her bottom. 

 After six he stopped. His hand was stinging, though it didn't look as hot as her bare ass. He had surprised himself, not intending to hit her so hard. He gently rolled her off his knees, where she struggled to stand upright. Her panties were around her ankles. He was surprised she didn't stoop to pick them up. Less so, than when she agreed to be spanked. 

 "What do you say?" he demanded. 

 "Thank you sir, for punishing me, err, for spanking me," she whimpered. Only just refraining from rubbing her sore bottom, she stood at attention before him. 

 "You've been a dirty slut. Say it," he quietly told her. 

 "I've been a dirty slut, sir, sorry sir," she agreed. 

 "Now you've been spanked, do you agree to behave yourself like a decent young girl," he wanted to know. 

 "Yes, sir. Now I've been spanked, I'll try real hard to be a decent little girl," she promised. 

 Paul studied her with a hard expression. She dare not look up at him. She struck a little girl lost pose, looking contrite. She looked as though she would promise anything at that moment. 

 "Go stand in the corner with your hands on your head. Pull up those panties, before you trip over, girl," he scolded her. 

 He selected a file from the brief case to study a photo. It was her alright. He had researched the company, its finances, and its employees. He had an eye for faces, and had a good look at her in the greasy burger bar. 

 It shocked him to realise a young guy was screwing her in public. It occurred to him she might be a younger sister. While she served customers he decided it really was Bernice. He always looked for weaknesses in a company when sent as a consultant, but this was dynamite! 

 It was unusual, but obviously she was playing a dirty game. How he was going to use this against her would have to be decided by Monday morning. 

 He added more notes to the file. There wasn't much else to peruse. He kept her waiting for as long as his patience lasted. 

 "Come here, girl," he ordered. 

 "Tell me what you have been up to today. Tell me everything!" he warned. 

 "I couldn't, err, I can't. It's too dreadful," she stammered. 

 "Did you suck them all off earlier?" he asked. 

 "No! Just Harry," she started to excuse herself, only to fail dismally. She had just admitted to giving that boy a second blow job! Paul had witnessed everything else. 

 "I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I won't do it again, I promise. I'm so very sorry, sir," she pleaded, while wringing her hands in anguish. 

 He was used to making difficult decisions. On one occasion he had to close a company. This time there wouldn't be the grief from employees losing their jobs. This looked like turning out to be a pleasure. He liked playing games, though it would be under his rules, not hers. 

 "Your parents should be informed. Though I'm sure you don't want anyone to find out about this," he stated. 

 "Please sir, don't tell them, please!" Bernice begged. 

 "The only way I'll keep your dirty secret, is for you to do as I say," he said. She had been struck dumb. Her head nodded once, then rested upon her chest. She looked beaten, but he wasn't one to take a chance. 

 "You'll do exactly as I tell you. All the time, from now on, until I think you've learned how to behave like a decent young girl. Do you understand?" he demanded. 

 "Yes. Yes, sir, thank you sir," she pathetically agreed. She didn't know how to react in this situation, besides, what could she do or say, but agree to anything he demanded. Acting like a little girl trying to be good was all she could come up with. 

 He was appraising her, like one of his works of art. He seemed to like what he saw. That was both good and bad. 

 "Lift up that dress," he said, with a frown creasing his brow. 

 Without the slightest hesitation she lifted the hem around her waist. 

 "You seem to be enjoying yourself again," he plainly stated. 

 In dismay she realised the panties were wet! Her nipples were small pebbles. Her breasts were tingling. The warmness of her breasts was spreading to her tummy. An all too familiar hot feeling between the legs, heralded an uncontrollable need was on its way. 

 Soon she would be dripping on his precious white carpet. He had been toying with her, and so was he now going to play with her? Despite it being him, she couldn't deny the feelings that surged within. After being so badly humiliated, it was awful to feel how aroused she had become. 

 She had hired him to advise her on a business strategy. Now she was a sex doll, ready to be played with. More than ready, she was breathing heavily, needing it, needing to be satisfied. 

 Paul watched her visibly heating up. She was so aroused she couldn't stand still. It looked as though her motor was running, ready to get off. 

 "You really are a hot slut! I didn't spank you hard enough!" he sternly said. 

 "Do you want to spank me?" she slowly said. She was looking at him through long eyelashes, flaring her nostrils. The tone of voice indicated she was ready for whatever pleased him. 

 "Pull your dress down, you dirty little slut," Paul managed to say. He was tempted, but there was a long term strategy forming in his mind. 

 Bernice felt as though he had slapped her face hard. The desire was ready to explode. She was prepared to crawl to him, and beg for his cock. All that stopped her was a look of disdain on his face. Even that insult aroused her. She trembled with lust. 

 "Go to your room! I don't want to see you until morning," he growled at her. 

 In the spare bedroom she threw herself on the bed. As soon as Paul was asleep, she would phone home to make sure her husband was there to pay for a taxi. At least dressed like this she looked respectable, even if she didn't feel it. 

 Utterly shattered, she spread her legs to try and quell the fire. She began to furiously frig herself. It was no good. Kept on a high, unable to orgasm, she began to fantasise. 

 The boys in the woods were taking her one after another, using all her holes. They were robbing her of all self-worth, with every cock entering her. They called her a worthless whore, and she sank deeper into being what they wanted her to be. 

 "I'm your fucking whore, fuck me hard. Make me cum, please let me cum," she murmured over and over. "I promise to stay with you. I'll be your gang slut, and be ready for your use, whenever, and however you want me. I promise to do anything you want, just let me cum, please!" she whispered. 

 She imagined three of them at once taking her. It wasn't love making, they were simple making use of a willing body. With a finger in her bottom, another in her vagina, and furiously thumbing her clit, she at last began to climax. 

 It was a desultory unsatisfying event, so she managed to keep it quiet. It was just enough to quieten the demands of her body. The heavy demands of the long sordid day were exhausting. Her breathing calmed down, and her eyes closed. Murmuring that she should phone home, tailed off into a soft snoring. 

 Paul listened at the door. The heavy breathing revealed what she was doing. The murmuring was enough to piece together her fantasy. He figured from how she reacted, and what he had seen, that she was turned on by humiliation. Being treated like a naughty little girl was a particular turn on. 

 Still unsure what to make of it, he decided to keep up the pretence. He would continue the charade, while pretending not to know who she was. It would be an interesting weekend.

Chapter 04 

 Bernice is sent back to school 

 Bernice awoke wondering where she was. Yesterday's events came flooding back, leaving her feeling ashamed. It wasn't a dream, or a naughty fantasy, the dreadful events had happened! The awful realisation that she was still in trouble, still caught in a trap of her own making, added to the misery. 

 Returning to the spare bedroom from the bathroom, she fixed her hair. Pulling her long hair into pig tails was a ploy to continue deceiving Paul. 

 Revealing all to Paul was out of the question. He had rescued her from a group of teenagers while performing a sordid act with one of them. It was both lucky and lucky that he came along. 

 Paul was a professional consultant she was hiring. The only piece of good luck was that he didn't know who she was, as he hadn't met her. He was supposed to start on Monday, so she would have to terminate the contract as soon as she got away from his home. 

 She pulled on the large white panties and dress. On top of the guilt, she felt foolish. The young girls dress was nice enough, but too big for her. She felt like a little girl, instead of the mature woman she was supposed to be. After the inexcusable behaviour of yesterday, it was difficult not to think of herself as a disgusting slut. 

 There was no alternative, except to try and behave like a repentant young girl, while in his home. 

 The hair style and clothes were a reminder of her position here. She was a bad girl, and had been spanked for her wicked behaviour. She sighed heavily, knowing the humiliating pretence would have to be maintained for a little while longer. 

 At least she could go home in these clothes, without her husband asking awkward questions. An excuse as to where she had got them would have to be thought up. Telling anyone she had been dressed by a hired consultant was impossible. 

 With a trembling hand on the door-handle, she lifted both shoulders in an attempt to stiffen her resolve, ready to face Paul. 

 "You're up earlier than expected. Adolescents usually sleep for the best part of the day," Paul chided her. 

 "Yes, sir," she demurely answered. The way he talked down to her, made it easy to pretend she was a young eighteen year old. 

 "What do you want for breakfast?" he asked. 

 "Some cereal will be fine, sir," she said, and realised how hungry she felt. "I need to call home, may I use your phone, sir," she asked. 

 "Sure. I'll take you home once you've eaten. I'm glad you've changed your attitude, young lady. You seem more polite, and know your place. You behaved like a nasty little slut yesterday. I'll have to tell your parents something, when I deliver you home," Paul sternly spoke. 

 Bernice choked on the cornflakes. She lived with her husband, not parents. The idea of this man taking her home to inform her husband of what he had witnessed, was terrible. Telling her husband she had sucked off that young gang leader, and was about to carry on with the others, just wasn't possible. 

 "There's no need, sir. Please don't tell them. Like, really, I promise to be a good girl in future, honest, sir," she stammered. Pretending to be an adolescent was vital, until she escaped home. 

 The look of dread in her eyes was understandable. He knew she was married, and didn't want him to meet her husband. He could park up the street, and reveal he knew who she was, before sending her home. Though what exactly he was going to do was still to be decided. A business plan always had to be flexible, and so too was this. 

 "I feel responsible for you. I need to know your parents will keep a tight control over you in future. You're a young girl, and I want to make sure you behave well in future," Paul heavily stated. 

 "Yes, sir, sorry sir," Bernice gushed. "You don't have to speak to my parents, do you?" she asked, looking coy. With imploring eyes she begged him to spare her. 

 He was supposed to be working for her on Monday morning. Yet here she was at his mercy. Caught between revealing everything to him and begging for his silence, or her husband finding out the sordid details of yesterday. Either way it was a dire prospect. 

 "Make the phone call, while I think about it," Paul firmly stated. 

 He wondered what story she would come up with. It was amusing keeping this attractive woman squirming in an agonising dilemma. When he turned up at her office, he would have a powerful hold on her. The fun would be over then, as he used her forced co-operation in business negotiations. 

 Bernice listened to the recorded message, willing him to pick up. Even on the machine his voice sounded angry, as well as worried. Well, this was all to the good. She could go home and change before he got back. She turned around to find Paul watching her. 

 "They aren't back yet, are they. No need to lie to me, I can see it on your face," Paul warned her. He heard a recorded voice, though not the words. He would recall the number and listen to the message, when she was out of the way. 

 

 "Like, you could take me home. I'll stay in, grounded, and wait for my parents. I promise not to get into trouble, sir. I'll be a good girl, honest, sir," Bernice pleaded. The good little girl act was convincing, from a desperation to get home. 

 Paul was highly amused, though he didn't show it. This business woman was behaving more like an adolescent than his eighteen year old niece. That thought gave him an idea. 

 "After your sordid behaviour of yesterday, how can I trust you? You'll stay here until they return home, young lady. Or should I call you a slut? A reminder of what you got up to will do you good. I'll call my niece over to chaperone you. Until then, go to your room, and think about what you are, and what your parents expect of you," Paul ordered. His patronising tone had her almost in tears. 

 He watched her meekly slink off. She looked young in the photo he had on file. The way she held herself, spoke, and behaved, was convincing. She was regressing into the role of a suppressed teenager. He wondered how her parents had treated her, and if that had something to do with the games she played. 

 He listened to the answer phone. It was the usual stilted neutral message people left. He called his niece. With the promise of a payment she was willing to spend the weekend with them. Like her father, his brother, she skilfully negotiated the amount. Although just eighteen, she sounded more like a professional businesswoman than Bernice. 

 He made mental note to call the woman Barbara, and not slip up. He didn't want to reveal he knew who she was, just yet. He sat down to plan a campaign. He would play the woman along all weekend then 'discover' who she really was. It would be an interesting confrontation. 

 As usual Susan let him down, and wouldn't be turning up until Sunday evening. He kept Bernice out of the way in the spare room. All there was to do, was read girly comics and books. They shared meals together, and he took the opportunity to rub in her lowly position, by patronising her. Sent back to her room, to think about how she had behaved like a slut, cowed her into submission. 

 She was sinking deeper into the role, behaving like a sulky adolescent, from not getting her own way. Every time she phoned home a message was played from her husband. On Sunday it changed. His voice sounded shifty, as he said he would be away at a business conference. 

 "I listened to the message. You lied to me, young girl! They were home all along. Now your father has gone away on a business trip. I could have taken you home, and saved me the bother of keeping you out of trouble," Paul crossly spoke. 

 "I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to. Like, he was out whenever I phoned, like I said," Bernice complained. 

 "You can't run rings around me like your father, girl. I'll spank you again if I have to," he angrily said. "You will do as you are told, and behave like a decent young girl," he firmly told her. 

 "Yes, sir, sorry sir," Bernice demurely capitulated. 

 She couldn't think of a way out of the mess, and even stopped asking to be taken home. It was easier to give in and see what happened. She felt like a naughty girl staying with an uncle. It was Sunday, so this couldn't go on any longer. 

 Bernice heard voices, and wondered who it was. She hated the idea of meeting anyone else in this abject state. If she was found out now, so be it. Whatever happened she would just have to live with the consequences. 

 In the study Paul revealed his plan to Susan. Not everything was revealed, though he wondered if she could ever be shocked. 

 "I think it's a fantastic idea. It's strange and kinky, which I just love," Susan giggled. 

 "Do you think it will work?" 

 "I'll have to look her over first," Susan said. She covered part of the picture, to study the woman's face. "From this she looks the part. It'll cost you though. My fee," she explained, and laughed at his expression. 

 *** 

 Monday morning came around quickly. Bernice was relieved, as it meant he was going to his office, so she could escape home. From there she could email him to cancel the contract. He was dressed in a smart business suit, and Susan was smartly dressed for an interview. 

 Dressed in a school uniform, she figured they expected her to go to school. She just hoped he dropped her off, and didn't wait to watch her walk in. It would be so embarrassing going into school, surrounded by all those kids. Still, she could just walk out again, and the safety of home wasn't far. 

 "You look more decent this morning, Brenda. Perhaps spending the weekend contemplating your wicked ways has taught you some decency," Paul stated. 

 Bernice had become used to the name Brenda, and hiding her real-self behind it. Between the two of them she felt small and submissive. Dressed the way she was added to the feeling. 

 "To make sure you continue this improvement, I've arranged for you to attend a special finishing school, for disreputable eighteen year olds like you. Susan will enrol you. Make sure you do as she tells you, or I'll punish you, understood?" Paul warned. 

 "Yes, sir," Bernice murmured. 

 "You heard my uncle. Speak up, girl," Susan goaded her. 

 "Yes, sir, sorry, Susan," Bernice chirruped. 

 Her voice was changing to match her demeanour. She sounded like a young girl. The memory of lying over his knee being spanked, brought a flush to her cheeks. The warmth she felt wasn't just from embarrassment, for she was aroused by the thought. 

 Bernice didn't think she could get away with the deception at school. It was imperative to wriggle out of it, yet difficult to defy them. She wanted to explain that she was a twenty-four year old woman, and wouldn't fool the teachers. With eyebrows frowning deeply she tried to speak. 

 Perhaps this was the moment to reveal who she was, before it went any further. 

 "I can't, err, like, go to another school," Bernice started to say. 

 "It's not up to you. I've decided to take charge of you. You're an ill- disciplined girl, and I'm going to make sure you learn to behave yourself. When your father gets back from the business trip, I'll talk to him. I'm sure he will agree with me," Paul informed her. 

 He had her exactly where he wanted. There was no way of refusing him, unless she revealed who she was. An image of her standing before her husband, in the school uniform flooded her mind. She imagined them discussing her disgusting behaviour, and that she needed to be disciplined. 

 "Pay attention, girl! You had better do as we say," Susan chided her. "It's an exclusive school, and a good opportunity," she added. "They have a good reputation for dealing with rich kids who've gone astray," she smirked. 

 Bernice felt as though these two were her parents. A compulsion to obey them came with the feeling. Wearing a school uniform would help, and she did have a baby face complexion. Was it possible to pose as an eighteen year old? Surely it just wouldn't work. 

 "If you behave yourself, don't get into trouble, and show a marked improvement, I won't tell your parents," Paul promised. The serious look held her attention. 

 

 The years rolled back, and she found herself promising to try her best to be good. For a moment she forgot her parents were dead, and that it was her husband she lived with. She would do anything to avoid anyone finding out about her terrible behaviour. 

 She looked at them both, knowing it would have to be endured. Perhaps it was a punishment by the gods for her evil ways. 

 "Thank you, sir. I promise to be on my best behaviour. I'll be a good girl, promise!" Bernice enthusiastically agreed. 

 Bernice was only five-four and felt small and vulnerable next to both of them. She often wished it were true that small people had large dominant personalities, to make up for their size. With a young face and petite bone structure, she found it difficult to be taken seriously. 

 It had been a struggle to make it to manager of the department. It was her first class economics degree, and analytical skills that won the position. When it came to dealing with staff, she always felt awkward. 

 Seeing the school building with adolescents milling around brought back unwelcome memories. She could feel the years falling away, leaving a feeling of helplessness. On top of that, she was going to be a new-girl. Eventually Bernice shrugged, thinking it was at least an opportunity of escaping Paul. She climbed out of his sedan, where Susan waited. 

 "You're a new-girl, so be careful, or you'll get into trouble. You don't want to be spanked by Paul again, do you?" Susan knowingly smiled. "Once you get into class, just mingle with the others," Susan advised. 

 Bernice hesitated. Confronted by loud young students was different from talking about it around the kitchen table. 

 "Come on, girl, there's no avoiding it," Susan said, and grabbed her hand. 

 Susan wanted to laugh, but held back, not wanting to put the woman off. This was a tough game, though looking at her, she would get away with it. She surmised there was more to it than Paul was letting on. It didn't matter what they were up to, as long as he paid up. 

 "Don't worry Barbara. I'll look after you, well, until you're registered," Susan promised with a laugh. "You look like a shy adolescent, rather than the filthy young bitch uncle told me about," Susan smirked. 

 Bernice turned a beetroot red. She just hoped he hadn't told Susan everything. The thought of it had her squirming uncomfortably. She couldn't look anyone in the face, from excruciating embarrassment. 

 No-one else wore a school uniform in this school, so that would attract unwelcome attention. She wondered how this woman would stand up to it. Fear and discomfort were clearly plastered upon her face. Among the milling teenagers she began to take on an awkward, embarrassed look. Susan figured she wouldn't stand out as a mature woman at all. 

 *** 

 "Thank you Mister Mendes, I am sure my niece will be very happy here," Susan smiled at the principal. She played her part by dressing more sophisticated than usual, with lots of sex appeal, all intended to distract the poor man. 

 Each time he looked at Bernice, Susan re-crossed her legs with the magnetic buzz of stockings massaging each other, which she performed in slow motion. His head was automatically drawn to the inadvertent flash of white slender thighs, between the suspender straps. 

 In between times she paid attention to him, by leaning forward with a cleavage designed to impress by a cleverly constructed bra. In the air-conditioned office he was mopping his brow, and running out of topics to keep her attention. 

 "The school curriculum is specifically designed to reform awkward teenagers. We have a very impressive success rate," he said, while studying her cleavage. "We don't usually take on new students without a reference, though as a special favour to Paul, I can make an exception," he added, with a bright smile directed at Susan. 

 "Thank you, it is most appreciated," Susan smiled back at him. 

 "Just sign these papers," he explained. Bernice too signed several documents. 

 "Everything is in order. This young lady is officially in the custody of our school. We are responsible for her until she leaves our premises. You had better take back this document. It's Pauls guardianship papers. He has complete control over her, until she reaches the age of twenty-one," Mr Mendes commented. 

 The thought of acting like an adolescent for the next three years was overwhelming. Having Paul dictate her life would be terribly demeaning. She shook her head, in an attempt to clear it of the absurd notion. 

 Once outside his office Bernice kept her head down, as she had throughout the ordeal. It had to be admitted, Susan played her part to perfection. It would have suited her to be rejected, though here she was, facing a tough jury, the students. 

 She didn't like the sound of a curriculum designed for awkward adolescents. 

 "Don't be worried dear, it's a new school and everything will be a little strange at first, but I'm sure you will do just fine," Susan sympathised, while patting down Bernice's uniform. 

 "Pull up our socks, and straighten your tie, sweetie," Susan said, enjoying the act. Treating the woman like a silly schoolgirl was great fun. She was bending to the role. Just as far as she bent over to pull the white school socks up. She noticed the lads turn their heads when the woman bent over, and smiled to herself. 

 Continuing to pick at non-existent fluff, and adjusting the white blouse, Susan told her. "I'll pick you up after school, now give auntie a kiss," she said, with a condescending pat on Bernice's head. 

 Bernice gave her a cross look, mouthing, 'just go'. The overly concerned mother act was annoying, but she presented a cheek anyway. For a moment she felt like a young adolescent, rebelling from a mothers smothering care. It was humiliating, and more so, as it was an adolescent treating her like a naughty child. 

 "You look so cute in that uniform, dear," Susan smiled. She just couldn't help patting the woman's bottom. With a fierce look, Susan gripped Bernice's chin to re-enforce her dominance. 

 "Be a good girl, dear. I don't want to hear you've been in trouble, or you'll have your bottom spanked," Susan warned, in a stage whisper, loud enough for the students to hear. 

 A gleam of devilment fired Susan's eyes as she glanced at a prefect waiting for Bernice. 

 "Is the uniform alright, it was worn at her last school," Susan asked the principal, who seemed reluctant to leave. He stood there mesmerised by the sight of Susan playing up to him. 

 He nodded vigorously with a big smile on his face, indicating anything she did would be just perfect. Bernice looked at him then back at Susan, knowing something was going to happen. She just hoped it wouldn't be too embarrassing. 

 "What about these, are they according to regulations?" Susan asked, with a false look of concern. The principal reluctantly looked at Bernice. 

 Bernice felt the short pleated skirt pulled up, showing off a pair of white knickers. The damn young girl was showing of her panties to the principal, and everyone else! Her face reddened in embarrassment from everyone witnessing the humiliating scene. The girl was treating her like a ten year old. 

 She was about to remind Susan she was eighteen, having submersed herself in the pretence. 

 Pretending to be an adolescent was bad enough, but this was going too far. Bernice felt like telling them she was a mature woman, an adult, deserving respect, but how could she? A group of students were giggling at her. She felt weak and defenceless, as much as when first starting high school all those years ago. 

 The principle murmured something, and retreated back to his office. 

 "My little girl doesn't know the rules, so I hope you will be lenient on her first day," Susan smiled at the prefect. "Now go with this young lady, be a good girl, and do as you're told," she said. Enjoying the charade, Susan dramatically blew a kiss, and smartly departed.  

 

 

===

She just couldn't help rubbing it in. She was busy thinking up ways of embarrassing Bernice later, when picking her up from school. It was so much fun playing the over caring mother; playing at being her own mother. 

 Bernice wanted to cry, only just managing to hold back the tears. Watching Susan clack away in high heels on a hardwood floor, she felt a pang of fear rise from the past. It was as though her mother was abandoning her. She felt as though she were a young girl again, in a strange world full of hurdles. 

 The prefect's diction was perfect with a clipped Boston accent. "You are lucky, first day, no bad reputation, no homework to hand in, and most of all, only a few months before we leave," the girl told her. 

 She was only eighteen, but larger in build, adding to Bernice's awkwardness 

 "What's it like here?" Bernice asked, trying to make conversation. 

 "You'll find out soon enough. Just don't get in my way, new-girl," she warned. 

 Despite the threat, Bernice felt encouraged, as she seemed to be accepted as a student. The prefect acted tough, but Bernice was older and wiser, so it shouldn't be difficult to last until lunchtime. Besides, she had graduated from high school easy enough. 

 The teacher hardly looked at Bernice as she entered the classroom, and found a desk. She blushed on seeing the young guys checking her out. She wished the skirt was longer, but everyone else wore it well above the knee, and she had to blend in. 

 The classroom was the same as any other throughout the world, or at least the ones she had seen. So familiar was it, she began to sink into the role of student, with the years rapidly fading away. She even joined in by raising a hand to answer a question. Surprisingly she felt pleased when chosen. The answer was a little awkwardly phrased, for she was more used to business meetings and conferences. 

 As the lesson wore on it all came flooding back. The furtive messages passed when the teacher was preoccupied, boys being boys, and girls pretending not to be bothered. Sinking in to the familiar role of student, the uncertainties and self-doubt experienced all those years ago, began to shape her thinking. 

 It was nearing lunchtime and she became a self-conscious young girl again. Too late, she remembered it was taboo to raise a hand when the teacher asked if there were any questions. Sighs and groans went around, as she asked for clarification. Everyone wanted to get out of the class, and she was holding them up. 

 What she didn't have were friends to bolster her confidence, and share thoughts with. The isolation was unbearable. With a lunch box gripped tight, she went to join a group from her class. 

 The high fence was meant to keep people out, and the students in. Surely someone would know a way to escape the place. If she didn't get away before collected by Susan, it might mean another night at Paul's house. His heavy demeaning attitude, together with being in class, was affecting her. 

 The thought of being reduced to a naughty schoolgirl, while he had free reign over her department, was annoying. She had to escape and take back control of her staff. 

 There were benches laid out on the grass under trees. The shade, with a slight breeze was cooling, but she felt her cheeks were hot. 

 "May I join you," she asked, as though it were an office coffee room. 

 "New-girl, you had better join the swats. If we like the look of you we might invite you to join us, eventually," the brash girl told her. 

 Bernice had forgotten how cruel fellow students could be, and these kids were even worse. The sniggers marked some of them as immature, while others effected a more sophisticated pose. The condescension in the girls voice was like a blast from the past. 

 Bernice took a step back knocking into someone. Turning to apologise she took a deep breath in fright. The prefect, Lara, was glowering at her. "Pick it up," she said, emphasising every word individually. 

 Bernice quickly bent to retrieve the fancy lunch package. The lid came off as she lifted and presented it, spilling the contents onto the grass. 

 "You stupid bitch!" Lara spat at her. With hands on hips she looked at Bernice as though she were vermin. Bernice shrank into a ball of humiliation, and Lara smiled a self-satisfied look. "You had better watch you don't get into trouble. You're aunt said she would spank you, did she not?" Lara announced to her friends. 

 Bernice dare not look up from under long blonde hair. It had seemed just a throwaway line this morning, but now it was a terrible blow. The others were sniggering at her. They were openly insulting her, and calling her a spoilt brat. She felt her hair gripped and head pulled up into the scowling face. 

 "Yes," Bernice squeaked. 

 "What did she say to you Barbara?" Lara asked, and shook Bernice's head. She was playing up to her friends, enjoying the new-girl's embarrassment. 

 A bully had humiliated her at the beginning of high school, only now she was supposed to be an adult. Once reaching eighteen they were above this sort of thing, or maybe it was because they had formed friends for protection. Bernice had no-one to protect her, and felt pathetic. 

 "If I get into trouble, Aunty will spank me," Bernice was forced to say. The words were hissed out under a confusion of emotions. The thought of that young girl, Susan spanking her was demeaning. The others were laughing at her, joining in the game of crushing the new-girl. Bernice was twenty-four but felt younger than these bullying eighteen year olds. 

 "Do you want me to tell the teachers, and your aunt, you've broken the rules? I'm sure I can think of something," Lara teased. 

 "No, please don't," she whined. The grovelling wasn't good enough, and the girl gripped her hair tighter. The girl needed her to submit, to emphasis their disparate positions before friends. 

 "We can't have your mother spanking you, it might catch on," Lara said. The others laughed and groaned. 

 "If you're used to it, I had better save her the trouble," Lara growled. Still gripping Bernice's hair, she pulled the woman over the end of the table. Two of the others helped, pulling her tight over it by gripping both wrists. 

 Bernice gasped unable to speak. Surely not! She had never been spanked, not as a child, not even for fun in the bedroom. Only Paul had spanked her, and then she had deserved it. 

 "Don't you dare, you can't, I'm a woman not one of you, you're just a bunch of thugs," she shouted, in a shocked rant. 

 The tone of voice was all wrong, it only made things worse. They took it as an insult, and a challenge. She knew it, but couldn't hold back. The first slap quietened her. She gasped on feeling her panties roughly pulled down. 

 "A woman did you say? Not down there you're not!" Lara laughed. The others stared at her bare pussy and joined in, though more nervously. 

 Bernice suddenly realised what her torturer meant, and quaked with shame. The irony was, she had a full Brazilian before going on vacation, leaving everything perfectly bald. She not only looked baby-faced, she also looked baby-assed, with everything between her legs cleanly shaved and waxed. 

 Some kept watch lest a teacher appeared. A crowd had gathered behind her, spurring Lara on. The guys seemed quiet, whereas the girls goaded Lara, and insulted Bernice. Lara had a leafy branch, swinging it as though practising. Some were just staring at her upturned ass, while others were telling Lara to, 'just do it'. 

 The branch swished over her ass and she yelped. The sound of a pathetic yowl spurred on the crowd. They wanted more, and Lara liked the attention, so she swung again. The shape of it and the green leaves slowed the stroke, so it stung rather than pained. The disgrace was agonising. 

 Lara realised she had gone too far and dropped the branch. She pulled Bernice up, and shoved the crowd away. 

 "Show's over, get back to lunch!" she sternly told them. Pulling Bernice through the guys was the most difficult, as they wanted to see her ass, and offered to sooth it for her. 

 A bit of a sob was given away, but not much. Bernice kept her head down hiding between the four girls. They took her into the school building, where thankfully no teachers were around. If they discovered what was going on and informed her so-called aunt, she would be in trouble. 

 She didn't want Susan to find out about this pitiful show. Susan would inform Paul, and the least he knew the better. 

 They took her through the gym into the changing rooms. "Sit," the young woman told her. 

 It shouldn't be like this. She was a mature woman, so these young thugs should be showing her respect, not punishing her. She wasn't about to make the same mistake again. She would keep her mouth shut. Classes started soon, and she would be free of them. 

 Sitting down she felt her bare bottom on the bench. Bernice only got one word out before the bitch warned her to be silent. It was pointless to say anything anyway. They were hardly likely to go back for her panties, even if they were still there. Her panties were probably held as a souvenir by one of the guys. 

 It was a hurtful thought, those guys waving her panties around, telling the story, enlarging upon it to those who missed the spectacle. She had her ass spanked before a raucous crowd, and couldn't get the sound of their cheers, her yelps, or the swish of the branch, out of her head. She felt so small and pathetic, she desperately needed to slink away, but these witches wouldn't allow it. 

 "Sit still bitch," Lara warned. "We are giving you a make-over," Lara announced, to her laughing friends. 

 "Bunches, Miss will just love that!" Lara announced, and the others joined in the joke with derision. 

 Bernice felt like a little helpless doll, being groomed by a bunch of wicked ogres at Halloween. They even put ribbons in her hair. 

 From a locker one of them produced a little pink skirt and top. She was resigned to changing in front of them. When they found she had lost her panties, they squealed with laughter. She was right, they didn't bother to go and find them. They made disparaging remarks about her figure, but she managed to shut them out. 

 They pulled her before a mirror. Holding her chin up she had to look at their handy-work. Her long blond hair had been tied up into two bunches. The ribbons held them in place, and they bounced prettily every time she moved her head. 

 "What do you think?" Lara asked her. 

 Bernice wanted to slap the smug face, but even if they had been alone it would be risky, as the nasty girl would beat her. "Nice," she flatly stated. 

 "Not much enthusiasm after all our hard work," Lara complained, and pinched her arm. 

 "It's lovely, thank you Lara," she sniffled. She didn't want to break down in front of them, but they had her looking like a pitiable Barbie doll. It had been bad enough in the school uniform, and now she felt thoroughly humiliated. She looked stupid, and felt like an idiot to have let them get away with this. 

 The little pink skirt was dreadful, and the stretchy pink top was too tight. They locked her clothes away in a locker among the dozens behind her, so she was stuck with the horrid clothes. She looked like a brainless blonde. Worse, she looked like a girl who needed to flaunt herself. Sure, her body looked good, for she worked out to keep it toned, but to put it on show like this was just too vulgar. 

 They knew it too. They were excited, waiting for something, or someone. She wondered if the football team were expected to get changed here. Was she to be made their mascot? A pretty little dolly, without panties, passed around to be spiked on their dicks. 

 The thought of great big football players manhandling her was electric. Her face matched the redness of her ass. Of course she didn't want to be here when they got changed, though without a choice, what could she do? 

 With a sigh of relief she remembered they didn't have a football team. A tinge of regret was quickly kicked out touch. The soccer team wasn't playing today, so what was it then? 

 Miss Perez came in and growled at the girls. "What's going on here?" 

 They parted revealing Bernice. Miss Perez stared at the young woman with mouth open, almost salivating. 

 "She's forgotten her panties, Miss," Lara said. 

 "What?" the teacher asked, with a look of incredulity upon her face. She stood right in front of Bernice looking down at her. 

 Bernice looked up with a pathetic little smile, like a puppy waging its tail. A teacher had arrived but she didn't think it was a rescue. 

 Miss Perez lifted the skirt above her hips. She had suspected a trick of some sort. Occasionally girls presented her with a present. Someone they despised, and had under their power in some way. That was usually in leaving week though, not six months before the end of year. 

 She had been dressed to please, and so very pleasing she was. "Why?" the teacher asked. 

 "I don't know miss," Bernice squeaked. Behind the teacher Lara drew a finger across her neck. The message was clear; she had to keep quiet, or else. 

 "Are you an idiot?" she asked, with a scowl. 

 "Yes miss, sorry miss," Bernice mewed pathetically. 

 "She has something to tell you miss. Her aunt left instructions, miss," Lara said, while nodding and scowling at Bernice. 

 Inside Bernice was crying with shame. How could she tell this hard looking woman such a damning thing? She took a deep breath knowing it had to be done. "My aunt, miss, said I should be spanked if I get into trouble," she bleated pitiably. 

 "That's right miss, I heard her this morning. She's already been spanked miss," Lara added. 

 Miss Perez was fully aware of how Lara operated, but if she and her friends were making a peace offering of one of their victims, she might at least consider it. Lifting the back of the skirt revealed a red striped backside. She couldn't quite make out what had made such wide ranging red marks. The girls ass was impressive. 

 Spanking was not tolerated in school, and this had been administered recently. Lara was telling her a principle had been set, and Bernice hadn't complained. Not to the teachers at least. Bernice hadn't attempted to complain to her either. Maybe the slut enjoyed it. 

 Behaving like a dumb blonde had some advantages, and right now it seemed the only way out of this mess. Bernice had little choice. Trying to explain she was an adult would be stupid. They wouldn't believe her, and would probably think she was mad. 

 "I'll have to report this to your guardian, girl," Miss Perez scolded her. 

 "Please, miss, don't do that. I'll do anything not to get into trouble with my uncle," Bernice pleaded. Her voice sounded as pathetic as she felt. 

 "Really? Well, maybe I could deal with you. What do you say, girl?" the teacher asked. She gave the new-girl a threatening look. The others held their breaths in expectation, from knowing what the teacher was like. 

 "Yes, miss, thank you miss," Bernice quickly replied. She tried a weak smile, needing to win approval. The cruel look held little chance of sympathy. 

 "Off you go girls, back to your classes. Not you little Miss Muffet," she smiled. Hearing them leave, she grimly smiled at the girl. "You've heard the nursery rhyme about the spider, well I'm the spider. In this school we discipline malcontents. Drug addicts, those who have lost their way and let their parents down. Especially naughty little girls like you, who get into trouble with boys," she lectured. 

 "You're a dirty little bitch, flaunting your body for the boys, aren't you!" she scolded. 

 "It wasn't my fault, I didn't do it. Don't blame me. I don't know anything about it. It wasn't me, honest, miss," Bernice plaintively babbled. 

 "Let's see what you have to flaunt. Get those ridiculous clothes off. Now! Move it," she ordered. "I'll dress you in something decent before you go back to class," she growled. 

 Bernice quickly pulled off the top, then slipped the skirt down, letting it pool around her feet. 

 "Step out of that skirt and folded it up. Now the shoes and socks," the teacher scolded her. 

 Bernice stood at attention before the teacher, stark naked. She couldn't bring herself to ask for the promised clothes. The teacher was looking her body over with an obvious leer. 

 "Turn around and bend over, girl," she ordered. "Hands on the bench! Legs apart. Why did you denude your sex, girl?" she asked. 

 "It was a dare, miss, sorry miss!" Bernice tried excusing the shameful sight of her bare crotch. 

 "I shall take a particular interest in you. I'm known for my strict discipline. Sluts like you shouldn't be let loose with the boys. They can't help themselves, or should I say that is the problem. You let them help themselves, don't you! Speak up, slut," she demanded. 

 "Yes, miss, sorry miss," Bernice cringed a reply. Too her shame, it was only too true. 

 "When last did you have sex, and who with?" she asked. 

 "Friday miss. With some boys in the woods," Bernice quavered. She hadn't meant to speak out loud. The terrible truth spilled from her lips. 

 "Shocking! You disgusting little tramp! I shall have to keep an eye on you. It is no wonder the girls brought you to me. I shall make you into a decent little girl. What do you say to that?" she angrily asked. 

 "Thank you miss. I promise to try hard and be a good girl, honest miss," Bernice earnestly bleated. She felt so awful over what she had done, she needed to be punished and controlled. "I've been such a bad girl, I need to be punished for my wicked ways," Bernice moaned. 

 It was as though she were a young girl again, being chastised by her mother. Though her mother had never spanked her, she was bent over ready for a thrashing. 

 The woman patted her sore bottom. She winced from the touch. 

 "You're bottom looks sore. I'll spare you today. Tomorrow lunchtime you will meet me here. I'll decide what to do with you then. Make sure you behave yourself. What is this?" she asked. 

 "My, my pussy miss?" Bernice hesitantly spoke, on feeling a hand on her crotch. 

 "It's wet! You are a naughty little slut," Miss Perez purred. "I shall make you a special project. You will be my pet, girl," Miss Perez said, while gripping the woman's pussy. 

 Bernice remained bent over, leaning heavily on the bench. With her legs spread she hoped no one walked in. She heard the teacher walk back to her. She dare not move without permission. It was more important than ever to escape the school and Paul. The idea of becoming this woman's special pet, was horrendous. 

 "Here, put these on," Miss Perez told her. 

 Bernice pulled on the skirt and top. She felt much better. Her body was covered and she wore panties. The outfit was much the same as the other students wore. Not standing out left her feeling more at home. 

 "Now then girl. Do you promise to behave? You will do as I tell you, and we will soon have you behaving like a good little girl. Isn't that right?" she asked. 

 "Yes miss. I'll do as I'm told. I'll be a good little girl, promise," Bernice truthfully stated. The teacher had been kind enough not to thrash her, and already helped her by providing decent clothes. "Thank you miss," Bernice smiled. 

 "You're such a cute little thing," Miss Perez grinned, while patting Bernice's bottom. "I'm going to take great pleasure in training you, to become an obedient girl. On your way then, run along to your class," she encouraged. 

 She should have said something. Instead she had just capitulated, and agreed to co-operate. Yet what could she do? As a teenager, she couldn't talk back to an adult, let alone a teacher. As she hurried to a class, she worried about getting into trouble for being late. 

 All the anxieties of teenage life occupied her mind. What would the others say about being thrashed at lunch time? Would she be able to make friends after that? Would she be able to cope with schoolwork. On top of that the memory of having sex with those boys was so shameful.  

 

 

===

The way she reacted with Miss Perez was worrying. Her sex had been wet! Was she a lesbian, or bisexual? What would her guardian say when she arrived home without the school uniform! 

 The immediate worry was facing her class teacher. What excuse could she come up with for being late? The many doubts and nervousness occupied her thoughts, clouding her judgement. She had to cope with being a naughty schoolgirl, rather than being a mature woman, and an adult.  

 

 

===

Bernice was picked up after school by Susan, her so called aunt. Susan was Paul's niece and only eighteen, but made up to look like an older woman. She had done a good job on the disguise. The sophisticated make-up, nails, hair, and clothes, let Susan get away with the charade. 

 Bernice on the other hand, was pretending to be an eighteen year old. It was embarrassing for a mature, married woman having to act like an adolescent, and especially so, with this young girl bossing her around. 

 "What are you giggling at, girl?" Susan asked. 

 Bernice wanted to retaliate and put the annoying girl in her place. She had been congratulating herself on surviving her first day in a new school. It was a stupid thought, as she was no high school student, and had burst out laughing over the silly idea. 

 After only one day at school Bernice had sunk into the role fairly well. She had a run-in with a prefect and a teacher, and survived both humiliating situations. At least the afternoon had been quiet in class. Having someone to share thoughts and anxieties with was vital when growing up, so she would have to start mixing with fellow students. 

 She almost laughed out loud again. She had to remind herself, that she was a mature woman, and had left behind those awful feelings of self-doubt and anxiety years ago. 

 This had been the first day, and it would be the last. 

 She silently got into the sedan, with a typical tortured adolescent look on her face. She sat with arms folded, scowling. 

 "You can drop me off here!" Bernice announced. It was across town to her home, but she would walk it if she had to. 

 "No! Paul left strict instructions that I should take you home, and not let you out of my sight," Susan stated. 

 Bernice glowered, looking defiant and put upon. 

 Susan glanced at her while they drove home. The woman was acting weird. This morning Paul pretended he thought the woman was a kid, and they had all gone along with it. The pretence was strained, and not very convincing. Bernice seemed guilty and afraid, rather than young. Now she was behaving like a spoilt brat, when not getting her own way. 

 They pulled into the garage with the large automatic door shutting behind them. Bernice felt trapped, and with little choice traipsed into the kitchen behind Susan. 

 "Where's your uniform?" Susan asked, only just then realising the woman was wearing something different. 

 "I, err. . . I spilt paint on it. One of the teachers gave me this," Bernice lied. 

 There was no way she could possibly explain what happened. It would be too humiliating. Recalling the incident with the girls and Miss Perez, left her feeling small and vulnerable. 

 "That school uniform was expensive. I don't know what your, what Paul will say," Susan admonished her. 

 She just refrained from saying, 'what your father will say'. It was a familiar refrain her mother used. She was still unsure what her uncle and this woman were playing at. She was being well paid so what did it matter. 

 "Please don't tell him. Like, really it wasn't my fault," Bernice squirmed. She didn't want Paul to spank her again, so would have to gain this girls help. 

 Susan enjoyed this new power held over a woman. She stared Bernice down, revelling in seeing her submit. Looking her over afresh, Susan could see how different she looked from this morning. The adolescent pretence was far more convincing, from the way she behaved and spoke. 

 "I might make up some excuse for you. Do you promise to be a good girl?" Susan demanded to know. She imitated the heavy tone of voice her mother used when she was younger. 

 "Yes," Bernice conceded. 

 "Tell me then, so I know you mean it," Susan insisted. 

 "Like, Yea! I promise to be a good girl. Thank you Susan," Bernice demurely replied. 

 Bernice felt ensnared in the role, with yet more lies increasing its tight grip. If only she could tell them the truth and get out of this mess. The longer it went on the more difficult it was to escape. It was like a spiders web of lies being wound tight about her. 

 "You had better get on with your homework. Stay right there! Don't go to your room. I don't trust you not to get stuck into girly magazines. Get on with it then," Susan encouraged. 

 Bernice reluctantly flipped open a text book and note book. After a short while she became engrossed in the social studies assignment. It all seemed so much easier than before. This time she wasn't fervently looking forward to the end of school. This was it. The last school work ever. Before she realised it, the assignment was completed. 

 She sat at the kitchen table with a sense of satisfaction. She began to think back over the years of high school. Being bored in class, bullied out of class, her breasts developing late, boys, hating lessons, and the teachers. 

 While they waited for Paul to return, Susan fixed dinner. It left her feeling all the more like her own mother. Bernice was just sitting there, no longer glowering from being grounded, just staring into space. 

 "At least you could set the table," Susan said, with obvious exasperation. 

 "Alright, like really, there's no need to nag!" Bernice grumpily complained. 

 She could feel the response was wrong, yet couldn't help it. All weekend she had desperately tried to convince Paul she was a teenager. Being in school had demanded she behave like a schoolgirl, and she had. Reliving those awkward years of high school all over again was getting to her. 

 She had to get away before Paul got home. If he discovered who she was it would be dire. He knew about those boys she had been messing around with. Now he could tell her husband she had been at school all day. 

 "Hi Paul, had a good day?" Susan automatically asked. 'Shit! I'm turning into my mother, years ahead of time,' Susan thought. 

 Bernice tried to look unobtrusive, as though she could blend into the background, so as not to be noticed. 

 "That smells good! Have you been a good girl at school?" Paul asked. 

 Bernice had stopped cringing over being asked if she were a good girl. She accepted the demeaning question, yet couldn't accept that she was. Each time it was said, it reminded her of what happened Friday evening. She was a very bad girl. She felt like telling him she hadn't let anyone fuck her today. 

 "Yes, Sir," Bernice demurely answered. 

 "Sit down and we can eat together," he said. 

 While she washed up, Paul commented on the skirt and top. 

 "I gave it to her. They don't wear a uniform at that school," Susan lied for her. 

 "Alright, you can wear it tomorrow," Paul said. 

 He had a successful day while Bernice was absent from her office. The team in her department co-operated, without the boss looking over their shoulders. It would take awhile to gather enough information to make a proposal to the CEO, so he needed to keep her out of the department for a few more days. 

 Hell! Not another day of school, not that. Miss Perez was after her, and she would have to face those nasty girls. She had got herself into this mess and would have to talk her way out of it. 

 He was sending her to school because she said she quit, to work in that burger bar. He had watched her being fucked by that nasty boy, so she had to pretend to be someone else. At the time she had been pleased not to be recognised by him. Another mistake was telling him her parents were away. He ended up taking her to his home, to look after and make sure she behaved herself. 

 Damn! She had brought it all upon herself. 

 She neatly folded the school clothes on a chair, and wrapped a dressing gown around her naked body. She would have to do something. Where the hell was her husband? He hadn't answered the phone all weekend. The messages he left about being away meant Paul kept her here, until her parents returned home. 

 She padded on bare feet to the lounge, where Paul was working on a report. 

 "Can I phone home, sir?" she asked. 

 "Sure. If your parents are back, I'll take you home. If you promise me you'll be a good girl, I won't mention what happened," he smiled reassuringly at her. 

 A ray of sunshine lightened her feelings. She felt so excited at the prospect of escaping the nightmare, she danced on the spot. 

 "Oh! Like, thank you, Sir! I promise to be a good little girl, and do as I'm told. I'll keep away from the naughty boys, and study hard. I promise, honest!" Bernice gleefully gushed. 

 She was so excited it felt as though all her birthdays had come at once. A heavy burden had been lifted from her shoulders. The guilt over what she had done would return, and she had to work out what to do about Paul being in her office. All that had been forgotten. She was being let off school, and would be returned to the safety of her home. The humiliating charade was over! 

 Watching her skip off to his workroom, he wondered what lie she would come up with. The gossip in the office was that her husband was having an affair with a woman he worked with. Perhaps that is why she had been trying so hard to rekindle their marriage with silly games. She must have sensed something was going on. 

 It was while playing one of those games with her husband that got her into this mess. It was convenient for him to pretend he didn't recognise her, to keep her out of the way. He was finding it amusing keeping her like this, and pushing her to the limit. 

 Joan, the office gossip, figured the husband had finally left, and Bernice was recovering alone at home. It took a little digging to check their guess had been partially correct. In the end it had been so simple to find out what was going on. The husband had left her, to move in with the other woman. 

 Bernice listened to the answer phone message. It was short but certainly not sweet. Angus sounded uncertain, then firmed up his voice. He was leaving and not coming back! She was numb, not hearing the rest. She dialled again to listen once more to the message. Her husband wasn't coming back! 

 Bernice stumbled into the lounge, not seeing anyone or anything. The horrible news was unforeseen and shocking. She had tried so hard. Now she knew why he was paying her so little attention. 

 "Are they back home yet?" Paul asked, feigning ignorance. 

 Bernice shook her head. Tears ran from her eyes in silent splashes onto the carpet. 

 "Come here," Paul told her. 

 He reached for both hands and pulled her onto his lap. Wrapping his arms around her, he tried to console her. 

 "What's happened?" he asked. 

 "I don't know. He must have found out about what I did," she cried into his shoulder. 

 "Your parents didn't hear it from me, I promise you," he truthfully said. He steered her away from saying it was her husband, and continued to pretend she lived with her parents. 

 "No. I didn't mean my, I, I don't know what to do, I can't go back home," she sobbed. 

 "Don't worry little one, I'll look after you and make sure you don't get into any more trouble. You can stay with me for as long as you like," he consoled. 

 "Thank you, sir," she sobbed. His kindness in a moment of need was deeply touching. 

 "You're a good little girl. I'll keep you safe, as my special little girl," Paul whispered in her ear. For a moment he forgot who she really was, while responding to her grief. 

 Her husband's unexpected rejection hit hard. The years rolled back to when her father comforted her. When things were far simpler, and her father could put things right. She wanted to be somebody's little girl, and to be needed by someone. 

 Bernice nuzzled up to him. Feeling his strong arms safely wrapping her body was comforting. She felt frail, abandoned, and in great need of protection. She didn't have the energy to explain she meant her husband, and not her parents. 

 Susan watched Bernice drift aimlessly into the lounge. The woman was obviously upset. At first she thought they were playing some kind of management mind game. Paul had organised training exercises, which sounded stupid when he talked about them. Whatever it was, they were both acting very strangely. 

 She went to the spare room and grabbed the woman's school clothes. It wasn't new, so maybe it had been the truth, about a teacher giving it to her. It didn't need washing, so threw it back on the chair. A cruel idea occurred to her, and she picked it up again. 

 The two of them were still at it. The woman was sitting on his lap, sobbing her heart out. Susan had heard of regression therapy, but that couldn't be it, as Uncle Peter wasn't qualified. She continued to her room with a needle and thread. 

 "Bloody hell! Their stupid game is affecting me. I'm sitting here sewing, like my mother," Susan laughed to herself. 

 *** 

 Next morning Bernice dragged herself to the kitchen, not bothering with make- up. She felt dejected and withdrawn. 

 "You're not dressed! You'll be late for school!" Susan admonished her. 

 Wearing just a dressing gown, which was too long for her, she didn't look so young that morning. 

 Paul walked in, and her eyes lit up. 

 "Come on young lady, you need to get a move on. You promised to be a good girl and to behave yourself," he reminded her. 

 "Sorry, sir. I'll get ready straight away," Bernice apologised. She forgot about her troubles for a moment, when receiving a smile from Paul. 

 "Eat your breakfast first," he warmly said. He patted her head as though she were a favourite pet. 

 She looked up at him with a bright smile lighting her face. 

 Susan looked at the two of them. They were even closer now, from whatever happened last night. They hadn't done it, she knew that much. The way the woman was looking at him, and hung on his every word, she was acting like a lovesick schoolgirl. It was sickening. 

 Paul left early for the office. 

 Bernice came back into the kitchen pulling at the skirt and top. 

 "Come on! You don't want to be late do you?" Susan warned. 

 "Like, no, this skirt, its shrunk!" Bernice complained. 

 "There's no time for that now. I'll get you something while out shopping. Don't start! You promised Paul to be a good girl, didn't you?" Carol reminded her. 

 "Yea, OK, but, like," she shrugged her shoulders, resigned to not getting help this time from Susan. 

 Carol wanted to laugh at her. She had been too enthusiastic with the alterations last night. The skirt was too short and the top too tight. There hadn't been a bra in the woman's room, and she put the sensible panties in the wash. 

 "Wait a minute! What are you wearing under that skirt? Show me!" Susan demanded. 

 With a look of excruciating pain Bernice lifted it, show the girl her panties. They were see-thru, except for a small triangle of cotton at the crotch. 

 "You're a right little slut, I should tell Paul when he gets home," Susan said. 

 "Oh! No! Please Susan, it's not my fault, it's all I had, honest. Please don't tell him, I'll die of shame," Bernice pleaded. 

 "You promise to be a good girl today, and I'll get you some decent panties," Susan said. 

 "Yea, of course, I promise to be a good girl, honest. Like really," she meekly responded. 

 Bernice didn't complain or make a fuss when Susan dropped her off at the school. She didn't even try to slip away before walking in the gate. Once in the school grounds there was no way to escape, so she deferred to the inevitable. 

 Finding her way to class was easy enough, even though she was lost in thought. It confounded her that it was so easy accepting being sent to school. The feeling of wanting to be a good girl, as everyone kept telling her, was strong. She really didn't want to let Paul down. She didn't want to lose him too. The thought struck as being wrong, but she couldn't shake it off. 

 The only seat left was next to a boy. Like everyone else he was eighteen, and he was obviously a geek. It was comfortable sitting with him, like two misfits together. The guys were checking her out again. The short skirt and skimpy top suddenly became embarrassing. 

 She was no longer a confident woman. She was a schoolgirl feeling as though caught with her skirt up. She fidgeted on the hard wooden seat, feeling vulnerable and nervous. She uselessly tugged at the hem without noticing the automatic gesture. The girls gave her dirty looks, even the ones wearing similar slutty clothes. 

 Everyone began to leave the classroom and she wondered where they were going. She had been daydreaming over past times, not taking part in the lesson at all. 

 "It's a free study period," Jim said. 

 "Oh." Bernice replied. 

 "You can join me if you like," he nervously smiled. 

 "OK." she shrugged. 

 He gave her a big smile of relief. Following him out she realised it had been a big thing for him to ask her to join him. The others were in groups talking animatedly, unaware of the two of them. As a new girl she was a non-entity, not worth bothering with, but at least she had someone to talk to. 

 They sat in the shade of some trees on the school field. Others were scattered around with books open for show. He was trying to start a conversation, though it was hard for him, as she was in no mood to talk. 

 "You're way out of your depth with that one, nerdy boy," a tall handsome guy jeered. 

 She couldn't see who it was, as he was standing in the sun. His posture and tone of voice was annoying. On impulse she turned to Jim, and kissed him on the lips. 

 The guy snorted and walked off. 

 "Thanks," Jim said. He gave her a grin and they both laughed. 

 "You can kiss me again if you like," Bernice demurely spoke. 

 She trembled from his touch. Her kiss had been a smacker. Nothing more than a demonstration of defiance to an arrogant guy, and to everyone else who had bullied her. Recently and in the past. 

 His kiss was gentle. She felt a warmth of friendship. She was back to a time of innocence, where first kisses meant something. Their jaws ached as the kiss turned to a full blown devouring duel. Neither wanted to break the deep feeling of togetherness. Both needed to be wanted. 

 She felt a hand cup her breast. For a moment she demurred, wanting to push it away. Instead she clasped his hand, pressing it tight again a breast. She wasn't wearing a bra, and felt his fingers pinching a nipple. She was warm under the shaded sun, and hot from the intense caresses. 

 She guided his hand away, knowing he didn't mind, hadn't expected to be allowed such an intimacy. Hardly aware of what she was doing, her hand guided his to her thighs. She was an experienced woman used to receiving more than just a quick fumble. Her body was responding more that intended. She thought to stop it, yet her body denied her the strength. 

 His hand slid up a bare thigh. A gentle stroking massage, hesitant, and expecting to be thwarted. An exploratory press of fingertips against her panties felt good. Her thighs fell open of their own accord. Fingertips pressed firmly at her crotch. He found a wet patch and rubbed it. A finger caught at the edge of the panties and accidently slipped in. 

 Bernice sighed around his lips. The pleasing sound encouraged him. With his whole hand he held her sex, gently rubbing it with fingers exploring her crotch. Feeling her hardened clit rubbed, she responded by sucking his tongue into her mouth. He pressed and rubbed her clit harder when she quietly groaned. 

 

 She broke away from his mouth to take a deep breath. "Make me cum," she whispered. It was wrong but she couldn't help it. Like Friday night she was too far gone, too out of control, past caring about right and wrong. 

 She felt a finger push into her. She guided his thumb over her clit. He worked her hard, and slowly. He watched her screwed up face, eyes closed, concentrating on the delicious sensations. After all she had been through, she needed pleasure, and desperately needed a release from the torturous tension. 

 A wave of tremors fluttered from her tummy, sensitising her breasts, filling her mind with warm feelings, almost like love. "You can stop now," she sighed.  

 

 

===

He took his hand away and smoothed down her skirt. 

 Looking at the expression of dismay and love on his face left her feeling ashamed. 

 "Sorry, I didn't mean to. I, I'm sorry," she whispered. 

 "No! It was good. I enjoyed it, err. Did you?" he needlessly asked. 

 "Thank you, yes," she sheepishly answered. She felt foolish, naughty, and deliriously happy. 

 Looking around at the others, it was obvious they were absorbed in their own intimacies. Sharing jokes, teasing, and furtive kisses. No one had noticed. It had been a sordid sexual experience with a stranger, yet she felt it was nice. Not good, or exciting, just nice. 

 She kissed him on the lips. He smiled warmly. As though nothing happened they continued studying the maths books. For no apparent reason they occasionally laughed together. 

 "It's lunch time. We need to go to our lockers," he said. 

 He stood up and helped her to her feet. She smoothed down the skirt and adjusted the top. Walking with him back to the school building she felt lightheaded. She was a teenager again, experiencing innocent young love. 

 The big smile on his face reminded her of past times. The thought of him bragging to his friends frightened her. 

 "You won't tell anyone will you!" she blurted out. 

 "No, of course not," he reassured her. 

 "You won't tell your friends?" she asked. 

 "No. It's our secret, honest," he warmly smiled. "Can I see you after school," he asked. 

 "I'm not sure. My uncle is strict," she nervously said. 

 The two worlds seemed to collide. She wavered on her feet, with legs threatening to give way. What she had done with this boy was so wrong! He gripped her arm to steady her. 

 "If I can, I will," she lied. The imploring look on his face was too much to resist. She just couldn't spoil his moment. He would have to be let down gently. 

 "I've got to go," she firmly said. 

 It was lunch time! Hell! She had to go and see Miss Perez. 

 *** 

 "Yes, miss, sorry miss," Bernice trotted out the usual replies. 

 It was so easy to sink back into the role of student. Just being in school was enough to bring back those familiar attitudes. Fellow students and teachers reinforced the role. She was slight in build, which left her feeling intimidated by everyone around her. The school was for delinquents and misfits. She felt she fit into both categories. 

 "Your late, can't you tell the time?" Miss Perez crossly derided. 

 "No miss, yes miss," she blustered. 

 "Those clothes your wearing are disgraceful. What have you done to them?" Miss Perez demanded. 

 "They, err, shrunk in the wash miss," she stammered. 

 "You're not only dressed like a slut, you're lying to me," Miss Perez told her. 

 "Get them off now!" she stipulated. 

 Bernice wanted to cry. Yet again she was forced to strip off in the changing room, in front of the harsh teacher. She had been warned to dress decently, and had been kindly given these clothes. What had happened to them she had no idea. It was difficult to think straight under an onslaught of demands. 

 Miss Perez examined the skirt and decided the girl had altered them. The stitching was obviously amateurish. She took a good look at her before deciding what to do. 

 "Those panties! They're soaking wet. Give them to me," she said. 

 She sniffed them, and held them out at arm's length in front of the girls face. "What have you been up to?" Miss Perez asked.. 

 "Nothing miss," she sheepishly replied. The feeling of being a naughty little girl was overwhelming. She had let down Paul, and everyone else. 

 "They stink of your sex. Tell me what you've been doing, now!" Miss Perez harshly demanded. 

 "I, err, let a boy play with me," she whimpered. She didn't want to admit to it, but guilt forced it from her. 

 "You what? Here in school?" Miss shouted. 

 Bernice was shaking. Hearing someone walking in she tried to cover her nakedness. 

 "Stand still. Arms at your sides, and stand straight!" the teacher warned her. 

 Lara walked in with a couple of friends. They were no friends of hers. The girl had bullied her yesterday, and ended up spanking her in public. The humiliation hurt her pride more than her ass. Seeing the tall girls made her feel even smaller and more insignificant. 

 "Don't laugh at the naughty girl. She's been playing bad games with some boy. Look at the state of these disgusting panties. You let him finger you, did you?" Miss Perez asked. 

 "Yes, miss, sorry miss," she murmured. 

 The girls were looking at her with mock disgust on their faces. They were trying hard not to laugh. Bernice wanted to run and hide from the shame. 

 "Did you orgasm?" Miss Perez asked, pointedly showing off her victim to the girls. 

 "Yes, miss," she answered. Not wanting to reveal the sordid details, the teacher relentlessly dragged them from her. 

 "Remember her aunt said she should be spanked, if she misbehaves," Lara piped up. 

 "Obviously anticipating the dirty little girls behaviour. Bend over the bench," Miss Perez told her. 

 "But, miss, I'm, err." she quavered. 

 She wanted to tell them she wasn't a schoolgirl, she was an adult. She was a mature married woman, and couldn't be treated this way. How could she? She was naked, showing off her slender little body. She had admitted to letting a boy finger fuck her. Her husband had left her, so was she really married now. Of course she was technically, but she didn't feel it anymore. She felt she was a pathetic little schoolgirl, and a disgrace. 

 "What are you? Speak up girl," the teacher growled at her. 

 "I'm, I'm a dirty little slut, miss," she answered, with a frail voice. 

 "In consequence you deserve what?" Miss Perez asked. 

 "A spanking miss," she conceded. 

 "You shall have a spanking, to make you think about being a good girl," the teacher self-righteously spoke. 

 "Oww!" she cried out. The slap to her bare bottom stung. It wasn't a hand it was a wooden paddle! Again and again she yelped as her ass was flogged. 

 "Stand up! What do you say?" the ogre asked. 

 "Thank you miss for spanking me," she murmured. 

 "What are you going to do in future, and speak up," the teacher warned her. 

 "I'm, I'm not going to let boys play with me, and I'm going to be a good girl, miss," she said, before the sniggering girls. 

 "Good! Make sure you are a good girl, and behave yourself in school. I'll get you a decent pair of panties, then you can go," Miss Perez said, sounding warm and solicitous. 

 Not given permission to move, Bernice stood up straight with hands to her sides, before the bully and her friends. 

 "You are such a disgusting little slut. You haven't been in school two days and you've let some boy finger fuck you? Did you charge him, whore," Lara laughed, provoking the others. 

 "She can't help it, must be a nympho," one of the others suggested. 

 "Look at her little girls sex. She's not even got hair yet," another added. 

 "Waiting for breasts too. No wonder she doesn't wear a bra," the first one jibed. 

 Inwardly Bernice cried. Those years in high school felt so close, as though she were back there. She was a little undeveloped girl, being bullied by big girls, for no reason, just because they could. As an experienced woman she should have been able to fight them, if not physically at least verbally. Instead she was naked, feeling sick. 

 "Here, put these on," Miss Perez told her. 

 Gratefully Bernice got dressed. She pulled the clothes on quickly. She didn't feel much better once dressed. 

 "Lara, make sure she gets to her class. You! Be here on time tomorrow lunchtime. I will be waiting for you," Miss Perez warned her. 

 She slapped her panty clad ass under the short skirt. "Run along girl, and don't forget to be a good little girl," the teacher smiled. 

 Once outside Lara grabbed her hand. "Come along little girl," she smirked. 

 Looking up at Lara, Bernice wanted to tell her to leave her alone. She remembered all the hurts and pitiful pleas of long ago, and fell silent. 

 "I'll keep you away from her, if you agree to be my little pet-girl. What do you say?" Lara asked. 

 "I don't know. Can you protect me? What will I have to do?" Bernice asked. 

 "Do as you're told, that means whatever I say. Otherwise, you get sent back to her," Lara laughed. 

 Would it be any better than being thrashed by that teacher. Lara would have her running around like a slave. At least none of the others would bully her. 

 "I'll think about it," she dared to say. 

 Lara snorted, "You do that, little girl." 

 Lara looked her up and down with disdain. The girl was obviously older than eighteen. The principal must have been slipped something extra to let her in. Perhaps Betty had been right about her being a nympho. The uncle must have given up trying to keep her out of trouble, and sent her here as a last resort. Not that it would do any good, the place was a joke. 

 Bernice walked into class. The boy was there. She carefully lowered herself next to him. The hard chair made her bottom throb. Her heart fluttered from him being so close. It was the only nice thing about being in school. The feelings engendered from furtive passion, the mysteries of adolescent sex, passionate embraces, and instant love, all combined to thrill her like a storm rushing through her. 

 He took hold of her hand, which was limp from being so foolishly disturbed by him. 

 Her face flushed red. Of course she knew all about sex, she was an experienced married woman. It just felt new and exciting. Hell! She had an enormous crush on him. Her heart thumped loudly, feeling as though it was pulsing in and out of the tight top. 

 His finger delicately traced her palm, sending wonderful sensations through her body. She tightened her grip on his hand, wishing she could get a grip upon her feelings so easily. 

 The lesson seemed to drag on for an age. All the while she sank further into being a foolish schoolgirl again. At last it was over. They both dragged out the process of piling books into their packs. Everyone was gone, leaving them alone. 

 "We can't not here, I've got to go," she whispered, yet continued to stand close to him. 

 "Just a kiss," he whispered into her ear. 

 Her acquiescence was all he needed. He wrapped his arms around her and licked an ear, breathing heavily upon it. Feeling his kisses upon her neck sent shivers of delight down her spine. A warning over how submissive she became when aroused was drowned by desire. 

 He nibbled upon her lips. She opened her mouth, for him to enter her. She was ready for him, and ached to feel him really enter her. It seemed a long time ago that she had sunk so low as to kneel before a lover. Without thought she sank to her knees, pushing him against the desk. 

 Pulling his cock from his jeans, she kissed it, then sucked it into her mouth. Flirting and kissing, with the occasional grope, was all she had allowed with earlier encounters with boys. As a mature woman she was prepared to give more of herself. 

 She couldn't see the shock on his face. Her head bobbed up and down his cock, gaining enthusiasm and a faster rhythm. He glanced at the classroom door with a look of fear. His face became screwed up as his sex face took over. 

 He shot his load into her mouth. He watched her swallow it. The amazement on his face showed clearly. He wondered how she could have possibly submitted to such a brazen act, let alone commit it in class. He helped her up and clung on to her. Her nipples were hard, pointing at him through the tight top. 

 He gently squeezed one to find out what it felt like. He cupped both her breasts, holding them as though they were precious. To his surprise she lifted the top to reveal them. He hesitated, so she guided his hands to her bare breasts. He clutched them awkwardly, then began to knead the lovely soft flesh. 

 

 She was breathing more fiercely from arousal. She would do whatever was necessary to get what she wanted. Sucking him back to life would be a pleasure. 

 

 They heard footsteps in the corridor and froze. They quickly pulled their clothes together and stepped toward the door. There was no one there, so they scampered toward the exit. At least they weren't the last to leave school. 

 Near the gate she turned to him. "Wait till I've gone. I don't want my aunt to see us together," she explained. 

 Bernice skipped passed the school guard, and continuing with light steps toward her waiting ride home. She gave Susan a big smile and jumped in next to her. 

 Susan looked at the woman, wondering what she was so pleased about. It wasn't just over leaving school. On the drive home Bernice chattered about lessons. Susan glanced at her occasionally, wondering what the woman had been up to. 

 When they arrived home she stopped Bernice going to her room. 

 "So, what have you been up to today? Besides classes," Susan asked. 

 Bernice flushed, with her face and neck turning bright red. The guilty look was enough for Susan. Paul had emphasised the woman should be a good girl. He had let something slip about boys, without details, and tried to cover it up. Was this why Bernice was being sent to school? She couldn't figure it out and hated mysteries, especially when money was involved. If she found out what was going on, maybe she could screw more money out of her uncle. 

 "Nothing. Like really," Bernice emphasised too strongly. 

 "Lift that skirt," Susan said. "Come on, show me." 

 Reluctantly Bernice lifted the hem. She could feel how wet they were. 

 "They're soaking wet! I can smell you from here. Where did you get those from, you wore something else this morning!" Susan exclaimed. 

 "Sorry. Err. Like, I wet myself, and a teacher gave me these," she lied. 

 "You wet them like these are now?" Susan asked. 

 "Yes, no!" she said, with a voice changing from shame to denial. 

 "You're lying. You are a dirty little slut. You've been playing with boys. Haven't you!" Susan crossly stated. 

 "I'm sorry, really. Please don't tell Paul. Please, Susan," she cried in alarm. 

 The woman was reacting like a silly young girl, caught out over mischief. The game she had been playing was more serious than some mischief. Having her squirm was delightful. It was clear this was no young girl, but that was only because she knew it. The way she dressed and behaved would fool most people. Especially now she was so well practiced in the pretence. 

 Going to school was one thing, but having sex there was outrageous. Maybe they were setting up a teacher. Was Paul investigating someone for a client? In any event, she would take the money, and for fun would make this woman squirm. 

 "Take them off. Give them to me," Susan demanded. She held them at arms' length. 

 "These are disgusting. So you dirtied your panties this morning, and again you cum into these this afternoon," Susan surmised. 

 "Please don't tell Paul, please," Bernice cringed. 

 The woman didn't deny it. "You are such a dirty little girl, he needs to know. You promised to be a good girl, didn't you," Susan heavily stated. 

 "Yes. I'm sorry. I let Paul down. I didn't mean to, honest," Bernice whined. 

 "From now on you'll do as I say. I won't tell Paul, just as long as you tell me everything. Got it?" Susan stipulated. 

 "Yes, Susan, I will," Bernice muttered. 

 Feeling sick from shame, she recounted that day at school. It felt so bad to admit to letting a young guy play with her until she had an orgasm. After recounting the sordid episode in class, she blurted out that she was infatuated with him. She only just choked off that she was in love with him. 

 It sounded pathetic, leaving her feeling wretched. She was a grown woman admitting to having a thing for an adolescent. The sad truth was, that she was still feeling a strong attachment to him. 

 "Please don't tell Paul. I'll do whatever you want, honest," Bernice enthusiastically promised. 

 Susan stared at the woman until she looked down with shame and guilt. She had the woman beaten. She would keep an eye on her, and find out what kind of game they were playing, then decide what to do about it. 

 "Go to your room and tidy it up. You had better get some decent clothes on before Paul gets home," Susan forcefully said. 

 Watching the woman scamper off, she felt pleased. She wondered why. It was just a bit of fun telling a grown woman what to do, and treating her like a kid. She would have her running around like a slave, given the chance.

Susan took a glass of milk and a cookies to Bernice's room. Though she was being ignored, Susan sat next to her on the bed. It wasn't unexpected to find the woman reading a glossy teen magazine, after all, that was all there was in her room. She was small and light boned, looking fragile and hurt. She looked sorry for herself, which was understandable. 

 "Don't worry, I won't tell Paul," Susan smiled. 

 Bernice didn't look at the girl. "Thanks," was all she said. 

 "Tell me about him," Susan quietly spoke. 

 Susan stroked the woman's hair, wanting to gain her confidence. It was fascinated to find this woman was re-living the anxiety of adolescence. It was almost believable that Paul was making the woman do this for some therapeutic reason. She had to suppress a laugh. This woman was no adolescent, yet she was behaving like one. It was both funny and pathetic. 

 "You don't really want to know," Bernice pouted. 

 "We're girls together, men don't understand. Come on, tell me," Susan encouraged. 

 The woman looked as if she really wanted to share a secret. Whatever happened at school today was affecting her. It had driven her deeper into the role of pretending to be a schoolgirl. 

 Bernice was concerned over what was happening to her. It was like being on a rollercoaster, with her emotions plummeting one moment then soaring with euphoria the next. It was as though she had caught a disease from the eighteen- year-old girls in class. Her hormones were all over the place, as though she really was an adolescent. 

 Enjoying being in school again was worrying as it reinforced the idea of being a kid again. It was disturbing to have fallen head over heels for that eighteen year old boy. As a woman it was terrible not to be able to control her feelings, and losing her moral standing could be disastrous. 

 "You promise not to tell Paul," Bernice pensively asked. 

 "Sure, just between you and me," Susan smiled. She continued to stroke the woman's hair, hoping to sooth her nerves. Bernice was obviously taught and ready to burst into tears. 

 "He sits next to me in class. He's nice. A bit of a geek really. He has a lovely smile, and kisses so good," Bernice shivered, with a delightful look on her face. Her smile changed to apprehension, from realising she had revealed a naughty secret. 

 "So you've been kissing at school. Naughty girl!" Susan laughed. 

 It was weird hearing her talking like this. It was amusing having an adult submitting to her, so wanted the woman to open up so as to keep her that way. Any dirty little secrets that could be gained would be used against her. 

 "Only kidding, didn't mean it," Susan apologised. 

 "I was. I was a bad girl," Bernice admitted. 

 "Just for kissing? Don't be silly. Everyone kisses in school," Susan began, almost saying at your age. Bernice was a woman and shouldn't be in school, let alone kissing. 

 She wasn't sure how old Bernice was, though certainly over twenty. When she was made up for school in the morning she only just passed for eighteen. She could be mistaken for one of those girls that looked older for her age. She was tempted to ask what she was playing at with Paul. Before she could speak the woman started to open up to her. 

 "More than that," Bernice said, sounding contrite. "I let him play with me. I had an orgasm on the school field!" 

 Susan was astonished. The way it was said, it was meant to shock her. The woman was studying her. What could she say. 

 "Well, I guess that is naughty. What happened? Did he force you?" Susan awkwardly asked, knowing it was unlikely. 

 "No! I let him. I got carried away. I can't help myself. Someone told me before. I didn't believe them. Like, now I know for sure," Bernice cried. 

 She didn't say the someone was her husband. He had left her and the hurt had to be shelved away until she could cope with it. Pushing aside that old life made it easier to cope with this new one. Knowing she was escaping one problem, only to dig herself deeper into trouble didn't help. She just couldn't face the pain of losing her husband, so carried on with the subterfuge. 

 Susan wondered if this was a problem they were trying to work through. Maybe she was a nymphomaniac trying to work it out of her adolescence. Maybe Paul was giving her personal therapy, or something like that. She kept quiet, not knowing what to say, letting the woman cry. She rubbed her back and stroked her hair, trying to comfort her. 

 Needing to unburden herself, Bernice continued. "When everyone left the classroom, we started to kiss. He'd been so nice to me. . . I got carried away and before I knew what was happening, I sucked him off," Bernice sobbed. 

 Susan pulled her into her arms. She pushed Bernice's head into a shoulder and made soothing sounds. 

 "It's all right. Don't worry, I won't tell Paul. You're a good girl really," Susan lamely said. 

 So this is why Paul kept telling her to be a good girl. She was a slut, who couldn't control herself. Sending her back to school hadn't worked. It had spectacularly gone wrong. They sat in each other's arms, with Susan rocking her. After awhile Bernice stopped sobbing, and Susan wiped her face of tears. 

 She was both appalled and fascinated. Her interest in what Bernice and Paul were playing at was fascinating, though it was difficult to feel sorry for the woman. She wondered if Paul knew what he was doing. I didn't occur to Susan that she had grabbed a hold of the wrong explanation. 

 "Is the boy over eighteen?" Susan asked. 

 "Yes, of course!" she answered. 

 "Tell me what happens, when you start kissing," Susan quietly asked. 

 "I get excited. I can't stop him touching me. I get aroused, and want it so much," Bernice complained, sounding as though she were in agony. 

 "Has Paul kissed you?" Susan asked. 

 "No! He's been so nice to me. He's promised to look after me. I really want to be a good girl for him," Bernice choked, almost bursting into tears again. 

 "Don't blame yourself. You need help. Paul knows what he's doing. Going to school must be right for you," Susan said, sounding doubtful. She didn't have a clue, so had to go along with it. Being well paid to look after Bernice was reason enough to keep the pretence going. 

 "You must stay in school. Try to behave yourself while there. Paul will work out what's good for you. He'll look after you," Susan told her. 

 "Have you kissed others?" Susan suddenly asked. 

 "No! Only him in school, honest!" Bernice earnestly replied. She realised she had inferred there were others, outside of school, and she dreaded admitting to the terrible events of Friday night. 

 "So what about out of school?" Susan persisted. 

 "Paul caught me with some guys in the woods. He rescued me, and brought me home to look after," Bernice murmured. She hadn't meant to reveal that sordid episode, the sordid truth just spilled out. 

 Susan was shocked. So that was the point when he started to help her. The woman was a lot different now, compared to when they first met. Whether it was an improvement she couldn't tell. 

 "Bring him home tomorrow," Susan said. She wondered what say and do with him 

 "Really? I'm not sure. What will Paul say?" Bernice asked, looking worried. At least Susan wasn't asking about the other dreadful things she had done. The feeling of being a bad girl was overwhelming. 

 "It's Wednesday tomorrow, he'll be late home. Its squash night," Susan smiled. 

 "Alright, I'll see if he will," Bernice weakly smiled. 

 If Bernice could have stepped back to observe herself, she would have been shocked. She was behaving like an adolescent without even trying. She felt as though she were bringing home a boyfriend from school, for her mother's approval. 

 It was pushed firmly out of her mind that she was a married woman. She was just a naughty girl, trying to behave herself. 

 Susan too had fallen into thinking of her as a young girl. The troubled woman had opened up to her, and such deep emotions were difficult not to responded to. She kissed her forehead and patted her hair. 

 "You must try harder to be a good girl, for Paul, and me. Go wash your face, and get ready for dinner," Susan warmly said. She stood up wiping her hands on an apron. 

 "I will. I promise to be a good girl, honestly, Susan," Bernice smiled up at her. 

 *** 

 Paul arrived home to find the two women happily preparing dinner. He didn't notice at first. The tension between them had been replaced by a warm understanding. It was good to see them getting on, and it would have been natural enough, except that Bernice was deferring to his niece. It was the wrong way around. 

 He chuckled to himself on hearing their girly chatter. 

 "You're happy this evening, had a good day at the office," Susan commented. 

 Bernice cringed on hearing the word office. It was a reminder of that world of hurt she was hiding from. For a moment she stared at the table, wanting to forget all about it. 

 "I did. What about you, young lady, were you a good girl in school today?" he lightly asked. 

 Susan saw Bernice flinch. Not wanting Paul to know what happened to her in school, she quickly interrupted. 

 "She was. She's finished her homework, and had good marks for yesterdays assignment," Susan said. 

 Paul gave them both a big smile. Bernice looked guilty. She gave Susan a grateful look. He wondered what they were up to when they shared a conspiratorial smile. It didn't matter, so long as Bernice was kept out of her office. He was making good progress on the report, and would soon make a presentation to the CEO. Without her protective presence it was much easier gathering information from her staff. 

 "What are you two going to do this evening?" Paul asked. 

 "We're going to the mall, and your paying," Susan challenged him. 

 "OK! My treat. Just don't get carried away," he laughed. 

 It was still highly amusing seeing the two of them getting on like this. His niece was mothering the woman, who responded like a kid. She was washing dishes, ready and keen to be taken shopping. While they were out he'd read over the report. 

 "Have fun you two. Make sure you buy my girl some nice clothes," he said, and hugged Bernice before she left. 

 Bernice gave him a big hug in return. The admiring look made him worried. Was she getting a crush on him? He didn't need that. It was complicated enough without her falling in love. He had saved her from those guys in the woods, yet felt uncomfortable. He felt a pang of guilt, as he was using her as much as they had. He shrugged it off and settled down to the report. 

 Susan would have to play it carefully, which made it all the more fun. Every chance she got the roles were reinforced. The woman accepted it when she made decisions for her, and enjoyed not having to take the usual responsibility of an adult. 

 "Err, it's a bit, small," Bernice started to complain. 

 "I think it suits you. Go on, try it on," Susan demanded. 

 "Alright," Bernice relented. 

 "Come out here, so I can have a better look at it," Susan said. 

 Bernice looked embarrassed. The little skirt was far too short, and the skimpy top revealed her tummy. 

 "Come along, we'll look for a pair of shoes to go with it," Susan enthused. 

 She was having fun dressing up the woman in clothes designed for a young woman. She was so slim and small, that she had to refrain from dressing her in even younger clothes. The pink skirt and top looked far too girly. Knowing she was in her twenties made it look hilarious. 

 Bernice was in a panic from being led by the hand through the store. She reminded herself that Susan was trying to help, by buying her clothes. Susan meant well, but she felt stupid in the outfit. With her free hand she kept pulling at the hem. The flat shoes went well with the outfit, but left her feeling small. She was self-conscious of her height, so always wore high heels. 

 

 "They have a stylist here, so let's get you a make-over," Susan eagerly said. 

 The pig tails were far too girly, yet she couldn't complain to Susan. The stylist didn't say much, as she was being paid. Twirling the skirt in a mirror left her feeling like a porno extra. An old woman complimented her, saying what a cute young girl she looked. 

 Bernice gave in to the unavoidable situation. What could she do? It was all her fault, so she would just have to see it through. She must be able to escape them sooner or later. 

 "Come on, let's go for a soda," Susan smiled. She was trying not to laugh. The woman looked silly, and wore a pained expression. Despite that, she went along with it. 

 Sitting on a high stool Bernice was showing plenty of leg. Guys were furtively looking at her, worried if they should be ogling her. They were wondering if she old enough. A closer look confirmed she obviously was. 

 Bernice slurped the soda, and blushed. Susan fussed with her hair, as though she were the mother, or older sister. She shoved a lollipop in Bernice's mouth and smiled at the look of consternation on the woman's face. 

 "May I go to the restroom?" Bernice asked. It was a surprise that she had asked, and that it felt so natural to do so. 

 When Bernice began to slide off the seat Susan stopped her, with a had gripping her shoulder. 

 Bernice was caught on the edge of the red leather seat, with legs astride it. The little flared skirt was up, showing off her white panties. As one, the men lifted their heads to stare at her. Bernice stiffened in fright, as though caught in headlights. Her mouth fell open and the lollipop fell to the floor. 

 "Don't leave it there, someone will tread on it," Susan admonished her. 

 In a fluster, Bernice slid off the stool and bent over. Her foot rolled it under the stool. The flared skirt was pressed up her back, from sliding off the stool. Bending over pulled the panties between her cheeks. As though feeling their stares, she became aware of the show she was performing for those men. 

 She looked up at Susan with a look of shame in her eyes. She was really trying to be a good girl, and had let Susan down. She hoped it wouldn't mean Susan reported everything to Paul. She just couldn't bear it if he knew what she had been up to today. She stood up and straightened the skirt, determined to do as she was told. 

 "It's a lovely outfit, Susan. Thank you for buying it for me. Everything you bought me is, like, great," she smiled. Saying the words helped convince her the clothes were right for her. After all Susan had picked them especially, and her wonderful Paul had paid for them, so she should be grateful. 

 Susan found it hard not to laugh out loud from the way men were staring at Bernice. When she inelegantly bent over, their eyes nearly popped out. Men stared at the two of them as they left the store, wondering what the two women were playing at. They probably thought Bernice was an exhibitionist, or they were playing out a dare. 

 Once outside, Susan decided to rub it in all the more. "I saw what you did in there, you naughty girl. You just can't help it can you?" Susan rebuked her. 

 Bernice thought it was an accident, but Susan must be right. She hung her head in shame, feeling terrible. 

 "I had better get you some birth control, young lady," Susan heavily stated. 

 At the pharmacy Susan did all the talking. Explaining her young ward was playing around, Susan's friend went along with the ruse. Pretending to be the pharmacist, Francis lectured Bernice, warning her to be careful, and not to fool around. 

 "You don't want to get a reputation as a little slut, do you?" Francis warned her. 

 "No Ma'am. I'm trying to be a good girl, really," Bernice quietly said. She felt belittled, yet knew she deserved the lecture. 

 "I'll take charge of these pills, and make sure she takes them. I don't want her getting pregnant. She can't be trusted," Susan sighed. 

 Bernice didn't know where to look. Her face was a picture of humiliation. 

 Francis saw the pharmacist returning from her break and hurried them out. Too late, she remembered that the pills were nothing more than placebos. She hadn't been able to get the real thing, and didn't get a chance to warn Susan. The notes in her pocket were better than a prescription, so she forgot about it, and went back to serving customers. 

 The two women returned with bags of clothes and bags of enthusiasm. They disappeared into the bedroom to try on their new outfits. Paul showed enough disinterest to keep out of the way. 

 *** 

 Next day in school Bernice looked out for Jim, only their classes didn't coincide. She hung around the lockers, feeling excited from the prospect of seeing him. She knew it was foolish, but couldn't help it. Following the girls from class, she fumbled with the schedule to find out what was next. Balancing a bag and a badly copied schedule, some books spilled out onto the floor. 

 "Hi!" Jim quietly said. 

 He was worrying if he had gone too far with her yesterday. Had he pushed her into doing those things, or did she really want to do it with him. The thrill of having a girlfriend kept his mind spinning with hope and fear. Their heads were close together when he bent to help her. 

 "Oh! Hi!" Bernice exclaimed. "I was looking out for you, like, great news, I think. My aunt is cool about us. Can you come home with me?" she gushed. "You do want to see me after school, don't you?" she asked. The look on her face was a mix of expectation and apprehension. 

 "Your house? I thought we could just meet out of school," he said, looking worried. 

 "It'll be OK, honest. My aunt is cool, she won't get in the way, I guess. My uncle will be out. We can work on our projects together," Bernice lamely said. She realised it didn't seem so inviting to him. 

 "Once she's met you, we might be able to go out. To the movies or something," Bernice encouraged. 

 "Alright," he shrugged. He watched her walk away, feeling uncertain. The last thing he wanted was to meet her family. Still, it was exciting having an older woman as a girlfriend. He figured she must be twenty, and only just squeezed into school to re-sit the exams. He was eighteen, with little experience. She knew a lot more than he did, and he wanted to catch up. 

 Bernice felt as though she was going to burst with excitement. She hurried to catch the others and ran into the gym. Miss Perez was there, shouting at the girls. In the changing room she stood there looking worried. She hadn't brought anything to change into. 

 "So! Here you are again, late and unprepared as usual. No kit I take it? No good looking sorry for yourself, girl. Lara! Take this sorry specimen to lost property and get her something to wear," the teacher shouted. 

 Looking crestfallen Bernice followed the bully to a large cupboard, filled with discarded clothing. 

 As a grown woman the items left by schoolgirls should have been too small. As she was so slight the opposite was true. Despite that, Lara came up with something clean, and small enough for her to wear. 

 "You made a decision yet, girl?" Lara asked, while holding up two items. 

 Bernice was too afraid of her to say no, outright. "I'm not sure, what do I have to do?" she asked. 

 "Easy, whatever I say, you do. It's my protection in return. Perez hasn't even started with you yet, so don't think you're in for an easy ride with her," Lara informed her. 

 "Go put this on, girl," Lara said, handing her the least suitable of the garments. 

 Bernice hesitated, but was too frightened of her to accept the offer of protection. Maybe she could hold out long enough to escape school, and Paul. Paul! The idea of escaping him wasn't so urgent now. She liked the idea of him looking after her. Being his girl was becoming appealing, now her husband had abandoned her. 

 In the changing room the girls were pulling on their gym kit, and fixing their hair. They were only eighteen, yet looked so much bigger than her. Despite being much older, she felt small and fragile, especially when near Lara.  

 

 

===

Getting undressed with them was daunting. She had lost the protection and respect afforded to an adult. She was just another adolescent to them, open to teasing and bullying. The dreadful time she experienced in high school was fully upon her again. 

 "Come on, girl. Get those things off, quickly," the teacher shouted at her. "The rest of you get moving," she added. 

 "You can't wear anything under that, strip off," Lara ordered. She wasn't going to leave without the girl. 

 Bernice quickly stripped off and pulled the leotard over her shoulders, feeling it pinch tight at her crotch. With every step into the gym she felt it riding up between her cheeks. 

 "At last the princess deigns to join us," the teacher sarcastically announced. 

 Bernice reddened with embarrassment. She wanted to pull the leotard from her crotch, but dare not make a move with all eyes on her. The white garment was thin and stretchy, showing off her slim figure. Here it was devastatingly uncomfortable. 

 She always wore a padded bra, and was terribly self-conscious in front of these well developed young women. The girls were sniggering at her, adding to the shame of being so small and underdeveloped. 

 "Come over here! You can help Lara lead the class. You look like a gymnast, let's see what you can do," Miss Perez chided her. 

 At college Bernice had worked out, but since then had lived a sedentary office life. Late nights working on reports, missing lunch, and drinking too much coffee had wrecked her body. She was still thin, but lost the muscle strength needed for a good work out. 

 Music blared out, and she tried to keep up with Lara. Why did it have to be her leading the group. Bernice was one step behind, looking stupid while trying to keep up. Before her the girls went through the usual routine, bending, gyrating their hips, turning around, and side stepping. 

 The leotard was cutting her in two. She sweated so much it became transparent in places. Her small breasts looked pathetic. Everyone could see her crotch was cleanly shaved. They probably thought she hadn't developed down there either, or was a slut. 

 "OK! Take a rest. Not you, girl," the teacher said, stopping Bernice from joining them. 

 They sat around in groups watching, and laughing at her. Miss Perez was going to guide her through a new set of moves. With everyone watching she had to bend over to touch her toes. 

 "Straighten those legs!" the teacher growled. 

 Bernice soon gathered the teacher was intent on grinding her down. Every mistake was shown up, and the moves were becoming lewd. Sitting back on the floor she had to spread her legs wide. The others were giggling at her, and obviously sharing rude remarks behind their hands. 

 At last it was over. The end of the lesson, meant it was lunch time. When everyone had dressed and gone, Bernice had to face the torturer alone. 

 "You are still displaying your little body to everyone. I shall teach you to deport yourself with dignity young lady," Miss Perez said. "You need that badness spanked out of you," she added. 

 "Yes, miss," Bernice quietly replied. 

 The spanking wasn't so bad this time. Either she was becoming used to it, or it was less humiliating without Lara being there. She remained bent over waiting to be dismissed. The woman was looking at her bare bottom, admiring the effects of the spanking. 

 "Thank you, Miss Perez. I promise to try and be a good girl," she dutifully said. 

 Bernice automatically responded without prompting. There was no thought to the inappropriateness of a woman being spanked in school, like a naughty girl. Being a bad girl needing to be punished had been accepted. 

 At least there were good things to think about in this new life that had been forced upon her. She had a boyfriend who had her heart racing when he was near. Paul was there for her, though she couldn't tell him about what was happening in school. It would have been impossible to admit to her parents she was bullied when in high school, and so it was with Paul. 

 "If this carries on, you will have special treatment. I reserve this for very bad girls, who can't control themselves," the torturer heavily spoke. 

 Bernice saw the large black dildo, and quaked with fear. The flexible phallus looked terrifying. The dark look in the teacher's eyes meant she would take pleasure in using it. 

 "I, I, promise, to, to be a good girl, honestly, honest, miss," Bernice bleated. 

 "This will remove the need you have to flaunt your body to the guys in school. You'll be a good girl then. I'll train you to be my obedient girl. Don't worry, you'll soon learn to behave yourself," Miss Perez heavily said, while running the dildo over Bernice's lips. 

 She was back in high school, in front of a bully, fearful of being hurt. If she hadn't already urinated in the shower, she would have wet herself. 

 "Yes, miss," she whimpered. 

 "Run along to your next class, and make sure you're here on time tomorrow," Miss Perez demanded. 

 The girl was so terrified she headed toward the corridor. "Get dressed first, it's another school rule you need to learn," Miss Perez laughed. 

 Bernice sat tenderly on the hard wooden seat. The teacher, Miss Standing, was more interested in her phone than the class, so it was easy to cruise through the lesson. They filed out with an assignment to be completed at home. It should have been given in class, only the teacher was more interested in other things. 

 The last class was a relief. She forgot about her troubles as soon as she slid in next to Jim. They exchanged smiles and clasped hands under the desk. He stroked her palm, and took every opportunity to press close to her. 

 She had a deep crush on him, conveniently forgetting that she was a married woman. In class it was easy to forget who she was, or had been. That other world seemed so far away, even though it was just a few days ago she had the responsibilities of an adult. Not that it was easy being a schoolgirl again. 

 In this last chance school for misfits, it was difficult surviving each day. As the bell rang announcing the end of the school day, all the difficulties she was in melted away. 

 They were with the first students out of the class, pushing their way along the corridor, keen to be away from there. They filed past security, hand in hand. Outside the gate they let go of each other's hands, not wanting Susan to see the small sign of tenderness. 

 "You're quick this afternoon. Come on, I don't want to be caught in the rush of traffic. Hi Jim. Jump in the back the both of you," Susan offhandedly said. 

 On the drive home, Susan watched them in the mirror. They were glancing at each other, trying not to be obvious. Bernice was whispering to him, trying to allay his nerves over going home with her. 

 It was highly amusing seeing them together. If she hadn't known the woman, she would have mistaken them both for teenagers. He was obviously an older student, re-trying the exams. The students at that school were trouble makers, needing some sort behaviour correction. She wondered what his problem was. They were all rich kids, otherwise the police would have been involved. 

 *** 

 "Would you like something to eat?" Susan asked Jim. "You had better go and get changed," she added to Bernice. 

 Bernice and Jim looked at each other, communicating disquiet and reassurance. 

 "I won't be a moment," she said, and followed Bernice out of the kitchen. "Put on that outfit I bought you yesterday," Susan enthused. 

 "Do I have to? It's like, so, yuk," Bernice said, with a screwed up face of disapproval. 

 "You don't want me to tell Paul about this boyfriend do you? Well, just do as I say. Be a good girl and bring me your school clothes, I'm doing a wash," Susan said. 

 Back in the kitchen Susan fussed around like a housewife. She had dressed and fixed her make-up to look older. The young guy was just short of her age, but he hardly looked at her. He was embarrassed to be there, and only came along to be close to Bernice. 

 Putting down a can of soda in front of him she said, "You seem like a nice young man." 

 He didn't say anything, just shrugged his shoulders. 

 "Her uncle and I are looking after her, trying to keep her out of trouble. Bernice gets carried away with guys. I'm glad she's met you. She needs a steadying influence. I don't mind if you both, well, she's on the pill. She gets agitated, if you know what I mean. She ran off with some guys in the woods recently. That's why we're looking after her. If you both get close, it will help keep her out of trouble," Susan awkwardly said. 

 Bernice walked in with her school clothes, and threw it into the utility room. Not something she would have done at home. She looked at them both wondering what had been said. Her boyfriend looked highly embarrassed, and Susan looked furtive. 

 "Do you two have assignments? You can keep out of my way in your room, and get on with it then. I need to get on with dinner," Susan said. 

 Susan chuckled to herself when they left. The idea of Bernice with that young guy was so funny. She wondered if the lad was up to it. Pushing the two of them together was so much fun, she hummed a happy tune while cooking. 

 "What did she say to you?" Bernice questioned him. 

 "Nothing much," he said. He looked at her wondering if he heard right. Was her aunt really saying she didn't mind if they did it. It had been so embarrassing he couldn't swallow the drink. 

 When she perched on the edge of the bed, and patted it for him to sit next to her, he just stood there. He had been so deep in thought he hadn't noticed how she was dressed. The short skirt showed off her legs. The tight top showed she had small, perfectly formed breasts. 

 She wanted to quiz him over what had been said. The look he gave her was embarrassing. He sat next to her and wrapped his arms around her. She didn't want to start anything, not here. 

 "Listen," she began. He kissed an ear, and murmured something. The boyish charm and earnestness made her feel sorry for him. How could she tell him she was a married woman? He would be hurt. It was terrible the way she led him on in school. Did he think she was a slut? 

 The flutter in her heart was a reminder of what she felt for him. She was deeply smitten. She couldn't disappoint him, or hurt him in any way. She let him kiss her. When he cupped her breast she didn't push him away. Feeling his hand inside the top had her breathing hard. The gentle touch to her nipples was delicious. 

 She kissed him back, and was soon devouring him. Their mouths pressed tight, with tongues duelling lightly. Feinting, touching, exploring, and deliciously sensitive moves. She hardly felt a hand stroke a thigh. Her legs parted for it to explore higher. His fingers touched her delicately, furtively. 

 She sat passively beside him, letting him lead her into temptation. The only movement was her tongue exploring his mouth. His fingers pressed against her lips, which opened up to him. She breathed heavily through her mouth, becoming wonderfully aroused. 

 Her arms locked around him, holding him to her. They fell back on the bed, kissing deeply. His fingers were in her panties, exploring her sex. He found her clit and pressed an already engorged button. She moaned into his mouth, and lifted her hips. She let go of him to pull her panties down. 

 She was a woman with adult needs. She had been denied for so long, after so much emotional turmoil. The need was strong, and overpowering all her better judgement. She pulled him onto her, with legs spread, her sex open and expectant. 

 He fumbled with his jeans, while still kissing her. His weight pressed her into the bed. She felt him raise his hips and knew the moment had arrived. She delved between them to guide him in. With her free hand she pulled his hip down, and felt him enter her. 

 She gushed a deep sigh of relief. His hard cock pierced her soft body. He didn't need encouragement, or guidance. He pushed at her with ardent enthusiasm. She pulled her hips down and thrust up at him, matching his rhythm. 

 

 "Yes, oh, yes," she moaned. 

 Jim forgot everything else except the need to drive into her. He rocked back and forth, wanting the moment of pure pleasure to last. All too soon he began to spurt into her. It felt as though his balls were being turned inside out. He groaned and laughed, almost crying with delight. 

 Bernice felt him drive home hard, and knew he was about to orgasm. When he shuddered and groaned, it set her off. 

 "Keep still, my love, I'm cumming," she murmured in his ear. 

 He collapsed onto her, crushing her, holding her tight. They lay still breathing heavily, not saying anything. She rolled him to her side, examining his sad face. He opened his eyes to give her a big grin of satisfaction. 

 She couldn't help teasing him. "How was it for you?" she mischievously asked. 

 He didn't say anything, instead his smile widened. He reached up and stroked hair away from her face. "It was wonderful," 

 "For me too. I needed that so badly," she admitted. 

 He thought of her aunts advice, to make sure she didn't become agitated. That she needed it, to keep her safe, away from men. Was this what she meant? He would try his hardest to keep her from becoming agitated. 

 Susan listened at the door. Hell! The stupid woman was making out with that young guy! She stifled a laugh. This was going to cost the stupid woman. She didn't know how to use the knowledge, but would find a way. The woman must be a slut to being doing it with him. She hardly knew the young man. They were both over eighteen so it was legal, but how could she do it with a stranger! 

 Susan went back to the kitchen, giving them time to pull themselves together. There was just time to get rid of the guy before Paul got home. She sniggered with delight. The woman was behaving like a stupid little slut, and Paul thought he was helping her. Or, did he? Maybe something else was going on. It was infuriating not knowing. 

 "Bernice! Dinner is ready. You had better wash up and come out here to help," she shouted.

Chapter 07 

 Bernice is manipulated by Carol 

 Bernice lay in bed worrying. She was a mature married woman, yet she was letting Susan, a nineteen year old girl, take over her life. The girl decided what she had to eat, wear, and everything else. There was no escaping the dominant girl because she drove her to school, and had grounded her. Susan had even put her on the pill! A young girl shouldn't be deciding she couldn't be trusted with boys, and so put her on the pill. 

 It was an awful thought, that her past record made it a prudent decision. Last night she and Jim, an eighteen year old from school, had sex. Only later did she realise, Susan had set her up, by sending the young guy to her room. This was all terribly wrong! 

 It felt so difficult to resist the downward spiral of her life, as though she were being dragged back in time. How in hell had this happened? Why was she still here, letting it happen? 

 Her husband left her for another woman, even after she tried so hard to spice up their marriage. The feeling of being a bad girl after all the things she did over the last few days, was difficult to deal with. Being treated like an adolescent, and sent back to school, was all a terrible mistake. She had never experienced such dramatic events in her life, so it was difficult to figure out how to cope. 

 It was all so overwhelming. Feelings of guilt over what she had done with those boys, the terrible loss over her husband abandoning her, inadequacy from bullying in school, all combined to shake her confidence. It left her unable to make a single decision about anything. Was that why she was letting others decide the course of her life? 

 She was escaping from making decisions by going back to school, and regressing into more innocent times. With the regression came the old uncertainties of adolescence. The bullying at school made it all the more real. Being aware of what was happening didn't help, it just left her feeling deeply inadequate and helpless. 

 The only good things happening were Paul's promise to look after her, and of course, Jim. Jim was eighteen and reminded her of a time of innocence, when problems were small and manageable. In those days problems regularly grew and faded, quickly changing from day to day. 

 Jim was a shining light in her life. He made her feel good. She smiled to herself, while cuddling a pillow. She could be a good girl with him. He gave her pleasure, and a reason to go to school; just to be near him. It was silly to be in love with such a young guy, but pushed the unease from her thoughts. 

 Bernice concentrated on him and their time together. He was nice, and wanted her, which at the moment she needed so badly. He kissed so gently and cuddled her so warmly, she wanted to please him in return. She drifted off to sleep thinking about him, with a smile lighting her face. 

 *** 

 "You look happy this morning," Susan said, when Bernice walked in for breakfast. 

 "I am, very," Bernice replied. 

 "Here's a coffee to take your pill," Susan offered. 

 It was crucial that she took back control of her life, and not submit to others, especially to Susan. Looking at the pill for a moment, she realised it was important to take it. As a married woman, becoming pregnant by that young boy, Jim, would be disastrous. She scooped it off the table and took a sip of coffee to wash it down. 

 She was hungry, and so she had to accept the breakfast Susan prepared. It was all happening again. She was accepting Susan's decisions, unable to break the habit. 

 "You look properly dressed for school today. Those clothes I bought you are much more suitable for school," Susan commented. "Just a moment. What are you wearing under the skirt. Not another naughty pair of panties I hope," she scathingly said. 

 Reluctantly Bernice lifted the short hem, to show the girl her panties. She at least had some decent white panties to wear, and Susan accepted them. It was unpleasant for a mature woman to have a young girl inspect her underwear before school. The condescending smile pushed her firmly in place once again. 

 Walking into school she looked like everyone else, going unnoticed, blending in. Her thoughts too became concerned with school routine, by checking the next class, and which books were needed. In school it was difficult to shake off the overwhelming sense of being a student, and there was no way of escaping from school once through the security gate. 

 The morning went quickly while concentrating on assignments and class work. She even felt pleased to receive praise from a teacher. School lessons of the past came back to her, and she had a greater understanding of everything at her age. After all, she had been to university, and was ahead of fellow students. Success in class gave her an incentive to join in and try harder. 

 She looked like a student, was treated like one, and behaved like one, so it was easy to think like a student in school. Without noticing she took on the attitudes of those around her. It seemed peer pressure worked despite her age. 

 When lunch time arrived she went in search of Jim. She only had fifteen minutes before having to go to Miss Perez. Just to see and talk to him was a priority. First stop was her locker. 

 "Hey Bernice, you coming to the gig Saturday?" Jilly asked. 

 "Like yea, if my aunt lets me. She's strict. Won't let me go anywhere," Bernice grimaced. 

 "Like the skirt. Wish mom would let me wear them that short," Denise said, while rummaging through her locker. 

 "Like, I'm getting Jegins on Saturday," Carol bragged. 

 "Like, what's that?" Bernice asked. 

 "Sounds like a disease she picked up," Jilly laughed. 

 "The slut was bound to," Denise added. 

 "No! They're like, err, jeans and leggings, together like," Carol told them. 

 "My aunt buys everything for me. Don't think she'll go for them," Bernice commented. 

 "Did she buy that skirt and top? Like wow! She's cool," Carol said. 

 "Like, not cool, I don't get to chose anything," Bernice complained. 

 "What's with you and Jim?" Jilly said, with a sly smile. 

 "Not much," Bernice said, looking shy. 

 "You've been at it!" Denise giggled. 

 "Like of course! That's all they want, then they dump you," Carol butted in. 

 "He's not like that, he's nice," Bernice insisted. 

 "She's dropped her panties, and really lost it," Jilly said, and they laughed. 

 "Well, like, I really like him, and he really likes me," Bernice asserted. 

 "Go for it girl. Let him fuck you, then if he comes back for more, you'll know," Carol told her, as though she were an expert. 

 Bernice spied Lara approaching. Trying to keep her head down to escape the bully, she felt a hand on her shoulder. She trembled in fright from the contact. It didn't seem ridiculous to her; a grown woman, being frightened of a schoolgirl. Lara may only be eighteen, but she was bigger and more powerful. In school, and she also had the power of a gang behind her. 

 "Have you made up your mind yet?" Lara casually asked. She glared at the others, who wisely departed. 

 Bernice kept her head down, and murmured something non-committal. 

 "You won't need to visit Perez at lunchtime. You'll have more time with lover- boy," Lara laughed. 

 Hell! How did the bitch know about Jim? More time with him did sound tempting. Avoiding that horrible teacher was necessary too, as she was becoming more threatening every day. The drawback of being in her gang, was having to do as she was told. Shit! What did that matter. How much worse could it be than being ordered around by Susan. 

 "OK." Bernice murmured. 

 "Not very enthusiastic. I'm offering to protect you from Perez, and anyone else who tries to pick on you. Not that anyone would dare, once you're in my gang," Lara pointed out. 

 "Thanks. I want to be in your gang Lara. I agree," Bernice spoke up. 

 "You agree to do whatever I tell you, right?" Lara said, while poking Bernice's chest. 

 "Yes, I agree. Whatever you say," Bernice capitulated. Giving in was just so much easier than fighting everyone. All the girls had friends built up over the year, or even longer. As the new girl, she had no one. A boyfriend wasn't the same as having girlfriends. 

 "I'll settle things with Perez. Here, take this to Greg. He'll be in the sports storeroom," Lara said. 

 The girls eyes bored into her, daring her to refuse. She wondered why, as it was just a matter of taking a message to the boyfriend. Maybe she was chucking him over for someone else, and the messenger would have to take the outburst of anger. 

 She found the store room, and Greg. Without a word she handed him the note. 

 Looking around the room she noticed the lack of equipment. It was typical of the school, as it ran on the minimum of expenses. The fees they charged the wealthy parents were high. The teachers were poor quality and poorly paid. 

 Greg interrupted her thoughts. "Sorry," she stammered. 

 The big black athletic guy didn't seem angry. He was silently laughing at her. 

 "Do you know what's in the note?" he asked, looking highly amused. 

 "No," she said, only just refraining from calling him, 'sir'. 

 His presence was more forbidding than most of the teachers. From what she heard, he hardly attended classes, while he conducted some outside illegal business from inside school. So much for the school's reputation at rehabilitation. The staff didn't care whether students worked or no, just so long as they were here, and didn't make trouble. 

 "Lara is off this afternoon, and wants to make sure I don't stray with some blinder. She wants to keep me happy," he smiled. His whole face lit up when he smiled. 

 He put his head to one side and looked her over. "She's given you to me for the afternoon," he chuckled. "She knows how randy I am, and knows I won't get hooked on a little thing like you," he said, seriously considering her. 

 "Get undressed. I want to get a good look at my present," he said. He glared at her with full-on menace, while she just stood there looking bemused. 

 "You belong to me, girl. Get them clothes off," he told her. 

 He didn't turn his back to save her blushes, it was to answer the phone. There was no need to consider the options. Between the two of them she was in trouble if she didn't do exactly as she was told. With a trembling of her bottom lip, she began undressing. 

 Although used to stripping off in school, this was different. Surely he wasn't going to use her! It must be some kind of joke between them. Even Lara wouldn't have sent her over here for the boyfriend to screw. He had said strip, so she took everything off. She just hoped it was a humiliating test of her loyalty to Lara. 

 He turned around and looked her up and down. 

 "Nicely shaved, girl. You could join my girls at night, earn yourself some money. I'm a good pimp. Get you checked out regularly in a friendly clinic," he offered. 

 She was so nervous it took a moment for what he was telling her to sank in. 

 "No! I. I couldn't," she stammered. He looked at her fiercely for a moment, as though he wouldn't take no for an answer. The impressive muscles of his neck rippled, and chest muscles swelled. He looked powerfully aggressive, and not the person to cross. 

 Physically she couldn't to fight him off, and the words to talk herself out of this failed her. She stammered something incoherently, despite realising it was important to talk him around. With those big hands he could do anything he liked with her. 

 She felt like a little doll before him. Standing naked before such a powerful figure made her feel so very weak and vulnerable. She felt stupid to have stripped off, as now she couldn't just run away to find a teacher. Besides, his dominant physical presence had her petrified, so she just stood before him, unable to move. 

 "They all say that. After the first time it becomes easy. I know for sure, girl," he leered. He looked her over, wondering how old she was. Certainly more than twenty, so she was fair game. She was obviously easy to dominate, and so he figured she would do as she was told, without too much trouble. 

 The door opened and both of them looked toward it. Jim stood there looking at her, then glared at Greg. 

 "What are you doing?" Jim asked. His expression was a mixture of disappointment and anger. 

 "Nothing YET. What's it to you?" Greg asked, with a look of amusement. 

 "She's my girlfriend," Jim said, looking hopefully at her. 

 "Yes, he's my boyfriend," Bernice asserted. 

 She felt more guilty than ever from having let this nice young man down so badly. He had genuine feelings for her, and the hurt unmistakably showed. 

 "She's going to be one of my whores," Greg teased. 

 "I'm not!" Bernice whined. 

 "You going to save the girl," Greg laughed. 

 "I'll fight for her if I have to," Jim declared. 

 "No Jim. He'll hurt you. You can't fight him," Bernice cried out. 

 "Please, let him be. Don't hurt him. I'll, I'll work for you, whatever you want," Bernice stammered. She didn't think about the consequences, she just needed to protect Jim. 

 Greg's phone rang again, and he took the call. Murmured answers, and head nods were all he gave away. Jim and Bernice didn't even understand that much, for they were intently looking at each other. She tried to communicate that he must leave. He looked at her with anger. He began to understand she had said those things to protect him, but why was she naked? 

 The tension between them grew unbearable. 

 Greg completed the call. "Later! I need to go. Got an appointment," he grinned. He stopped in mid stride. "The panties," he said, with a hand outstretched. "Need them as a trophy to show Lara. If she asks, you sucked me off. Right?" he fiercely told her. 

 "Yes, sir," she hesitantly spoke. 

 She was relieved to see the hulk shrug his shoulders and smile. "The rooms yours this afternoon. Lara arranged with your teacher to be absent for the next lesson. She's good at that stuff. So you two get to it, that is, if he's really your boyfriend. If he isn't, your one of my girls," he laughed, and left. 

 "I'm sorry, Jim. Lara sent me over here. She gave me to him. I didn't know. . ." she cried. 

 Jim hesitantly put his arms around her, then gripped her tight. 

 "It's OK," he soothed. 

 He was still wondering why she was naked, but the answer could wait. There was an inviting pile of exercise mats by the wall. He sidled her over to them and sat her down next to him. He kissed away her tears. Holding her chin he worked his way around her face and neck. 

 "You saved me Jim," she sighed. "Tell me I'm your girlfriend," she whispered. 

 "You are, you're my girl," he hoarsely replied. 

 He heard her breathing heavily and took it as a signal to grip her breast. She was completely naked and he liked what he saw. His hard cock was a testament to that. They fell back on the soft mats. She began to fumble with his zip and soon had it open. He wished he had removed his shoes so that he could remove his jeans, but it was too late now. 

 "Do you love me, Jim?" she pleaded. 

 "Yes, I love you, I really love you, Bernice," he declared. 

 She sidled down his body to reach his cock. She sucked it into her mouth as though ravenous. She slobbered over it and sucked it all the way in. He was already hard, and she felt him stiffen, growing even harder in her mouth. 

 She tenderly kissed the end of his cock and gently squeezed his balls. Moving to his side she slid up the mat. He moved on top of her and she parted her legs. Their breathing was ragged with deeply drawn in breaths. 

 "Tell me you love me, Jim," she panted. 

 She felt his cock rubbing between the lips of her pussy, trying to find a way in. With one hand between them she guided him. The feeling of his hardness entering her was wonderful. She gave out an urgent moan of need. He drove home deeply. With both hands on his lower back she urged him on, to thrust harder and faster. The need for him was burning through her veins. The need for an orgasm was imperative, overtaking life itself. 

 "I love you, I do," he replied. 

 Feeling short sharp thrusts, pumping deep into her vagina, it was a sign he was about to cum. The knowledge that he was about to spurt his youthful vital sperm into her body, pushed her over the edge. A tortuous orgasm rippled from her tummy, to rack her body with burning flames. 

 "Keep still, hold it deep," she implored him. 

 The presence of his cock pushing hard into her, was fulfilling. She felt his whole body jerk, with his cock deeply embedded, pushing at the walls of her vagina. She imagined his sperm filling her womb, and cried out with uninhibited joy. 

 "Fill me up, fill me with your wonderful cum," she implored him. 

 He pushed into her one more time. He shuddered, then held perfectly still. Their breaths gushed from open mouths. They sucked in air as though emerging from the sea. He collapsed upon her and she wrapped her arms tight about him. He rolled to her side, with his arms about her, still with her arms clinging to him. They lay in each other's arms for a long while. 

 "You're my hero. You saved me from him. Thank you my wonderful lover," she whispered. 

 "You're mine aren't you," he said, half questioning, needing to hear her say it. 

 "Yes! I'm all yours. I love you, and want you," she whispered close to his ear. 

 

 Her lips kissed his ear, neck, and the side of his face. He turned it toward her, letting her kiss his eyes, nose, and lips. She wanted to show how grateful she was, and how much she needed him. 

 A few days ago she would have been appalled to be in school, making love to a young guy like this. Falling in love with an adolescent would have been thought ridiculous. Now she was besotted, unable to control her feelings, declaring her love for a teenager. 

 A married woman with a responsible job, shouldn't be naked in the arms of a young lover. That she was in school, pretending to be a student had been forgotten, as everything in the world had. All that mattered was that she was in the arms of her lover. 

 At last they stirred from the dream like state. He didn't remember removing his jeans and t-shirt. They glanced around the store-room looking bemused, as though spirited there by fairies. 

 "There's a sink in the corner, I need to wash up," Bernice said. 

 The sticky state of her thighs showed how much he had cum inside her. As an experienced, married woman, she had no qualms about washing herself in front of him. He found it fascinating. She laughed at him and he became embarrassed. It was his turn to wash. Instead she took hold of his flaccid cock and rolled it between her soapy hands. 

 "There's nothing I won't do for my hero and lover," she explained. 

 She still held his cock, when he firmly gripped her shoulders in both hands. 

 "Your mine now. You'll do what I say, not that thug. I won't let you work for him. I want you," he forcefully told her. 

 "Yes! I'm yours, all yours Jim, honest," she declared. 

 The small girly voice showed how she felt inside. Being his girl, and so strongly meaning it, deepened the feeling of being a schoolgirl. It was difficult to think of herself as a married woman with responsibilities. In any case, all that was lost. That past life had somehow vanished, as though it had been a fantasy life. The reality was that she was in school, with her boyfriend. 

 They slowly got dressed, between hugs and kisses. The first lesson after lunch was over, so they had to hurry to the next class. Bernice kept the hem down with both hands, as Greg had her panties. They entered the classroom with everyone else, barging and crowding in through the doorway. 

 Bernice felt a hand up her skirt and flinched. A quick glance over her shoulder found Jim grinning at her. She grinned back. They sat close together during the last lesson, with Bernice fighting him off when he tried to lift the skirt. He wasn't serious, just teasing her.  

 

 

===

It was so very naughty sitting at her desk in the short skirt, without panties. Wriggling and pulling at the hem was an automatic movement, which she tried to hide in case she was noticed. The teacher hardly noticed anyone, unless they were too boisterous. He relentlessly carried on with a droning lecture, whether anyone took any notice or not. 

 At last the lesson finished and it was time for home. Jim had swapped his locker with someone so as to be near hers, so they would meet up between classes. Jim took her hand once they were outside, directing her back toward the storeroom. 

 "We can't, my aunt will be waiting," Bernice reluctantly told him. 

 She nevertheless let him drag her along. He was so insistent, from knowing she wasn't wearing panties, he couldn't wait until tomorrow. Besides, the storeroom was Greg's domain and he had only lent it to them for the afternoon. When they might have a chance to be together again was out of their hands. The furtiveness of their relationship made it all the more exciting. 

 "Just a quick cuddle," he said, as they fast paced toward the building. She didn't believe it, but went along with him. 

 On opening the door they froze. Jim quickly pulled it back almost closed. They peered through a thin crack, to see Greg's bare ass heaving up and down. A woman was under him, groaning from each thrust of his powerful hips. Jim and Bernice turned to each other with wide open eyes, in awe of the scene. 

 They recognised the woman as one of their teachers. Miss Benet's eyes were rolled up in her head, and she was making loud pitiful noises. His feet and legs were pushing hard into the soft mat, as he pounded into her. 

 "Fuck your teacher hard, you bastard! Punish your slutty teacher for being a whore," Miss Benet whimpered. 

 They couldn't hear everything she said, as it came out as a string of garbled sounds. 

 She cried out again, this time loud and clear. "Make me you're whore, you bastard. Yes! I'm your white teacher whore. Pound me hard!" the woman exclaimed. 

 Jim pulled the door silently and firmly shut. They looked at each other with shared grins. 

 "He was really giving it to her," Jim commented, with something of admiration in his tone. 

 "A teacher. I wonder if Lara knows," Bernice mused. 

 "She's a bit old. Near thirty, or even older," Jim laughed. 

 Bernice shuddered at the remark. She was very close to the woman's age, though in a lot better shape. 

 "Yea! It makes me shudder too. I wonder if she was telling the truth? You know, what he said to you. About making you one of his whore's," Jim pondered. 

 "You can't mean it. Miss Benet is a teacher, she can't be working for him," Bernice sounded incredulous. 

 "The way she was enjoying it, he might have her doing anything he wanted. Besides, she would lose her job if anyone found out. He could blackmail her into working for him," Jim surmised. 

 "I don't know. In the throes of an orgasm she might say anything. It wouldn't mean much," she pointed out. 

 "How did she know about the stuff he does? That didn't look like the first time. Maybe he does it to her, then makes her work for him," he said. 

 Bernice didn't think the guy would want to screw the teacher if she was whoring for him. Anyway, that didn't matter. What mattered was, did Lara know about him screwing a teacher. 

 "It makes sense now! That's why he let us stay in the storeroom, and made me agree to lie to Lara about sucking him off. He was arranging on his phone to meet Miss Benet. That's what all those furtive calls were about," Bernice enthused. 

 Without realising it they were beside her ride home. Susan looked at them through the open window. 

 "You two getting in then?" Susan growled. She was in a hurry to get home. 

 Bernice got in the back and Jim with her. She would have to tell him to go very soon after they arrived home, in case Paul got back and found them together. 

 "You can stay if you like Jim. Her uncle is away at a meeting," Susan said, over her shoulder at him. 

 "OK. That will be good," he said, and gave Bernice's hand a squeeze. 

 She would like it too, except that Susan was again arranging her life. They could only be near when sharing a class, or when someone allowed them to be together. Bernice was still feeling troubled when they arrived home. 

 "You had better phone home to say you're going to be late," Susan told Jim. 

 "They won't care. Won't notice I'm not there," he stated grudgingly. 

 "Her uncle will be away until tomorrow, so you can stay the night if you like," Susan suggested. 

 Bernice turned back from the sink, where she was peeling potatoes. The mischievous look on Susan's face was a picture. It felt as though the girl was arranging for her to be fucked tonight. She looked at Jim and smiled. Why not? She hurried through her chores, eager to get to her room. 

 "Can I go and do my homework, Miss?" Bernice asked, unconsciously calling the girl 'Miss'. 

 Susan heard the small word, and understood its significance. Bernice was mixing a teachers authority with hers. Susan thought about the woman's young sounding tone of voice. Up until then Bernice had fought to keep her identity, as a mature woman. With Jim here Bernice was accepting Susan's authority, and behaving like a schoolgirl with a crush. 

 "Wait!" Susan demanded. "Lift your skirt. Show me," Susan said firmly. 

 With a look of hurt that only an adolescent can muster, Bernice slowly lifted the hem. 

 "You've been at it again! No excuses this time, girl. Who have you been with today?" Susan growled. She was angry, as though responsible for the woman. She knew their game was dragging her in, but couldn't help it. It was fun chastising an adult, so why not join in. 

 "No! It wasn't like that. I went to Greg. Then Jim," she stuttered then fell into silence. How could she explain any of it, Susan wouldn't understand. 

 Susan looked at the woman's thighs. It was bad enough not wearing panties. The woman had a trickle of dried cum on her thighs. Had she screwed two guys today? 

 

 "I thought you liked Jim? Who's this Greg?" Susan asked. 

 "It doesn't matter. I do like Jim. Like, Greg's no one," she explained resentfully. 

 "So you've just been with Jim in school," Susan quickly said. 

 "Yea. No!" she complained, looking done down, and caught out. 

 "If you want me to keep your secrets from Paul, you need to tell me everything. Go to your room, and finish your homework. Be a good girl and do as I say, deal?" Susan heavily spoke. 

 "OK. I will," Bernice capitulated, and dragged her feet out of the kitchen to her bedroom. 

 If she thought about it clearly, she wouldn't have thought of this as her bedroom, as it wasn't even her house. Thinking about her house, would lead to feelings of hurt, over her husband abandoning her. Thinking of this as her bedroom fit in with her new life. It was also where Jim was waiting for her. 

 He gave her a big beaming smile. "Homework first," she grimaced. 

 "I've done both of ours," he grinned. 

 "Well maybe we should do something else until dinner," she coyly spoke. 

 Her head was down, and she swung her hips from side to side, looking cute and innocent. It was wasted on him, as he just grabbed her arm to pull her onto the bed. 

 "Hey stop it," Bernice complained. 

 His hands were everywhere, too fast to fend off. 

 "Don't! You'll snap the buttons off," she told him. 

 She undid the blouse, knowing he would carry on until she relented. He wrapped his arms around her in a tight embrace, determined not to let her go. He pulled her up to his lips, not her lips, it was her nipples he was after. 

 "No! Be gentle. You'll suck them off," she complained. 

 "Like you suck me off?" he teased. 

 She refused to be baited. She tried not to get aroused, despite his best efforts. It didn't feel right. 

 Susan had arranged for him to be here in her bedroom. The girl had put her on the pill. She had just sent her to her room to be with Jim, and had arranged for him to stay the night. It felt as if Susan was arranging for her to be fucked. Everything in her life was being decided by others. She had lost all control, unable to decide anything in her life. 

 He pinned her arms to her sides, and kissed behind her ears. He had finally got the message. He licked an ear, and nibbled down her neck. She struggled to get free, but he held on. He fell on top of her, pushing her into the soft cushions, trapping her. He sucked her top lip into his mouth and nipped it. She thought she opened her mouth to put a stop to his nonsense. 

 His tongue invaded her mouth, toyed with her tongue, and darted away. She left her mouth open for more. His lips sealed themselves over hers and they kissed. Long and hard, with their mouths contorting, as their heads slowly moved around. Bernice was lost in a world of delight. She was hardly aware of a hand drifting up her skirt. 

 When fingers played melodious tunes on her thighs she remembered her vulnerability, from not wearing panties. It was too late. He had wound her up and was preparing to take her. He was taking his time, toying with her. His fingers were teasing her lips, which were already wet and open for him. He continued to play with her, while she gripped his back, pulling on him, unable to tell him to fuck her. 

 If he continued much longer she would demand it. However embarrassing that might be, she couldn't stand much more. Pleading with this boy to fuck her was bad. That he had heated her up to this point was damning. She should have more control than this. She took a deep breath, ready to ask him to take her. 

 Susan knocked on the door. "Dinner is ready. Leave what you are doing and get to the kitchen," the demanding voice ordered. 

 The startled pair parted. Jim stood up looking guilty, but Susan didn't enter. Bernice looked equally guilty, and pulled down the little skirt. 

 "I better go wash my hands," Jim murmured, looking embarrassed. He needed to wash her smell from his fingers. 

 "No time for anything, it's on the table," Susan shouted to them from the kitchen. 

 Bernice slowly worked spaghetti around a fork, then dipped it into the sauce. It was difficult to swallow. The smell of her sex was wafting across the table at her, from Jim's hands. The sensation of his fingers still lingered down there. She fidgeted on the hard seat, rubbing her lips on it. Her sex ached for him. 

 Susan's interruption had been planned. Despite not wanting to give in to the girl, the urge was driving her crazy. She looked across the table at Jim with an intense stare. If he bent her over the table she would let him take her, in fact she would cry out for him to fuck her. She squirmed on the chair again, grinding her sex onto the seat. 

 "You're hands are sticky Jim, lick them clean," Susan smiled at him. 

 He looked furtively between the two women, as though caught out, and was being dared to reveal it. Both of them were looking at him. He put the fork down and licked his fingers. He licked between two fingers, and while separating them a pair of legs. He licked the top of them as though it were Bernice's pussy. The taste of pussy was new to him. It wasn't distasteful. He could get use to it. 

 Bernice was looking at him with a strange look on her face. Had he done something wrong? Susan had practically ordered him to lick his fingers, so what could he do? 

 Bernice felt torn. Of course the girl knew the smell. Susan had got Jim to lick her sex juices from his fingers, in front of her. He seemed not to notice Susan's knowing look. The audacious act was turning her on. The way he licked those fingers, made her think of him licking her down there. She couldn't wait to get back her bedroom with him. There wasn't a chance in hell that she would be coy with him, or resist at all. Her entire body ached for his touch. 

 "I'll do the washing up. You two can go and play," Susan knowingly smiled. "Wait," she said. Seeing how eager they were to leave the kitchen, she just couldn't help frustrating them. 

 They waited, looking agitated. Susan felt a pang of jealousy. The young guy was around her age, much younger than Bernice. He wasn't exactly handsome, yet looked nice. He had a cute ass. She thought he should be screwing her not Bernice. The thought went as quickly as it had come. It left her a little shocked. 

 "Have you completed ALL your homework?" Susan asked. 

 "Yes," they chorused. 

 "Go on then, go to your room and play like a good girl," Susan laughed. 

 Susan watched them skip out, looking so alive they might have flown. The woman wore a glow of arousal that looked positively radioactive. He too looked obviously eager. Understandably so. He was a young eighteen year old, being given permission to fuck an experienced woman. 

 He could be forgiven because he was unaware of who, and what she was. Not her though. She had thrown away all the inhibitions that usually weighed upon a mature woman. She had become an irresponsible teenager, ready to please her boyfriend. Susan chuckled to herself. It was fun playing with an adult, and so amusing manipulating her. The very idea of sending her away to screw that young guy was wicked! 

 This time she would leave them to it. Like young lovers they were eager to explore each others' body, for the pure pleasure it brought. She would listen to them from her bedroom and play with a toy. When she heard them orgasm, she would join in. It promised to be a good night.

Paul returns home 

 Susan dropped Bernice and Jim at school. She watched them walk hand-in-hand through the school security gate, and couldn't help laughing. If she hadn't known Bernice was a twenty-four year old, married woman, it was possible to believe she was around nineteen years old. That Bernice was smitten with an eighteen year old boy, showed how acutely the woman had taken on the role. 

 Bernice was using the role as an escape from the awful realities of recent events. Thinking of herself as a naughty schoolgirl, was preferable to being a shockingly bad woman. She was trapped in the role, and falling into it more deeply each day. Being with fellow students had her regressing to such an extent, she not only spoke, and acted like one of them, she was even thinking like an irresponsible adolescent. 

 Susan found it amusing manipulating the woman while she was so emotionally unstable. She pushed Bernice and the boy together, until the inevitable happened. They had sex like young teenagers. It proved the woman had a problem. It seemed she couldn't resist a man once excited. Even the young eighteen year old boyfriend had her worked up out of control. 

 Putting Bernice on the pill, as though she were an irresponsible youth, had pushed the woman into submitting to her completely. Thinking about the birth control pills reminded her that her friend had left a message. In case she wanted more money for supplying the pills, Susan avoided phoning back. 

 What Susan didn't know was that her friend was trying to warn her. The friend hadn't been able to get the birth control pills, so handed over a placebo instead. Bernice wasn't on the pill after all. Even Susan would have drawn the line at manipulating a married woman into becoming pregnant. It would be a disaster if Bernice became pregnant by a young boy of eighteen. 

 *** 

 Bernice was sitting in class, daydreaming about her boyfriend, Jim. 

 'Eh? Sorry Sir, like, what was the question? I guess forty-two. Sorry sir, I mean it is forty-two.' Bernice breathed a sigh of relief that she had calculated correctly. 

 Double Maths wasn't a great subject first thing in the morning. She glanced at the clock, willing it to gallop toward break time, when she could meet up with Jim. 

 He didn't realise she was a married woman, and thought of her as only slightly older than him. It was wrong for her to lead him on, though, in class it was easy to think of herself as a teen. With her whole life falling apart she needed his affection. What he wanted was sex, and as a woman she had the experience to provide it. The young guy wanted sex every time they were together, and she needed him to cool his ardour. 

 It was nice that he was so much in love with her, but she couldn't cope with his youthful enthusiasm. They needed to slow down. She felt as though he, and everyone else, was rushing her into things without giving her time to think anything through. 

 The whole class was bored so they all looked up when the door opened, looking thankful for a distraction. Lara boldly marched in, and strode up to the teacher. 

 'I've come from the boss, he wants to see Bernice,' Lara told the teacher. 

 The offhand way she spoke to a teacher revealed her lack of respect. Picking and choosing which classes to attend, was normal for her. This maths class might even be one of hers, though she had never been seen attending. Not even the teacher knew for sure if she was one of his pupils or not. 

 He was about to berate her for interrupting his class, then thought better of it. Knowing her reputation, he wasn't sure what she might do if he crossed her. It was easier to play it safe, not wanting to find out where her power and arrogance stemmed from. Maybe she had something on the boss, as she called the principal. 

 'Well, yes, take her then. Go on girl,' he ill-naturedly told Bernice. 

 He sniffed, and pushed a pair of thick framed glasses up his nose. When he turned away from her, in dismissal, Lara grinned at his back for all the class to see. She took a firm grip of Bernice's arm to march her out to the corridor. 

 'These are yours!' Lara accused. 

 Lara held up a pair of white panties, dangling them in Bernice's face. 

 Looking around frantically, Bernice was relieved to see the corridor was empty. 

 'Why did you give them to Greg?' Lara menacingly hissed. 'He takes them as a trophy from conquests.' 

 Lara rubbed the offensive garment in the girls face, then stuffed them in her mouth. 

 Bernice felt sick. The smell and taste of stale sex juices was bitter. A mixture of dried, crusty, and wet sticky cum, filled her mouth. The panties acted like an ineffective gag. Lara pulled the panties from her victims mouth, and put a hand to her throat. 

 'Tell me what happened, and make it quick!' Lara spat. 

 'They are mine, but not the dirty stuff,' Bernice choked. 

 'If not yours, who's?' Lara fiercely glared at her. 

 'It's Miss Benet!' Bernice yelped in fear. 

 'So you know the taste of her pussy do you? Been playing in her dirty little secret garden have you?' Lara growled, not believing her victim. 

 'We saw her, and him, together,' Bernice blurted out. 

 'Who's we, and where?' Lara asked, while pinching Bernice's cheeks together. 

 It was difficult to talk, though she managed to tell the bully what she and Jim had seen yesterday. 

 Lara let go of her face, and held onto an arm with a fierce grip. She stood still, except for a tapping foot, while deep in thought. 

 'Miss Benet?' she murmured. 

 Bernice kept quiet about their theory that Lara's boyfriend, Greg, might be running her as a prostitute. Today it sounded farfetched, and too outrageous an idea. Yesterday their imaginations had soared beyond the possible. 

 'Keep those in your hand. Come with me,' Lara ordered. 

 The classes were starting to file out for a break. However humiliating it was, Bernice dare not hide her panties, after Lara had ordered her to carry them. One or two students noticed, and they pointed at her panties dangling in one hand. There was muffled laughter, though far less because she was with Lara, who was obviously in a bad mood. 

 'Good morning, Miss Benet, how are you today?' Lara smiled. 

 The teacher was on her way to the teachers rest room, but she plonked her bottom back down on the hard seat on seeing Lara. A look of dread crossed her face, and was just as quickly hidden. 

 'What do you want Lara, I'm in a hurry,' the teacher stated. 

 Lara held Bernice's arm up, to dangle the panties in front of the teacher. 

 'Enjoyed yourself with Greg, did you?' Lara asked. 

 'Stop this right now! I'm a teacher, not one of your little friends that can be bullied,' Miss Benet crossly spoke. 

 She tried to get up, but her legs gave way. She began to perspire, even looking ill, with a pallid face. 

 'Bad teacher! Screwing around with a student. Wouldn't be nice for you if that got into the papers. Would it!' Lara leered at her. 

 The bully was recounting the tale, and embellishing it with her own knowledge of Greg and his dirty ways. It was terrible to see a teacher squirming, and ducking from the missiles thrown by Lara. Bernice felt sorry for her. She even wished she'd taken the blame. Maybe she could have told Lara that Greg forced her. 

 'You got off when he called you his whore slut, didn't you!' Lara meanly growled. 

 'Yes,' the teacher murmured miserably. 

 Her head was almost touching the desk, after wilting from the verbal blows. 

 'Louder Miss Benet. Save your soul and confess,' Lara teased. 

 'I did all those things. I enjoyed it the first time. Not anymore. He makes me do it. He won't let me go!' the teacher sobbed. 

 'He threatens to tell on you, if you don't do as he says,' Lara said. 

 'Yes,' the teacher sighed. 

 She was still tense, and Lara figured she was holding back. The stupid woman should have been relieved to share with someone, yet obviously not with Lara. 

 'What about the rest? Tell me all,' Lara prodded. 

 'He won't let me sleep with my husband,' she snuffled into a tissue. 'He's wondering why. He thinks I'm having an affair,' she said, and blew her nose. 

 'There's a reason for that, because you are, with Greg! Tell me. Tel me all, and I might be able to help you,' Lara firmly told her. 

 'I can't, it's too dreadful. I've been so wicked!' She started crying again. 

 Bernice wondered if she was telling the truth. Would she help the hopeless woman, or use her as she did everyone else. Lara knew Greg well enough, and heard the rumours that he ran prostitutes. Was this teacher involved? Surely not. Greg was using the woman, but what for. 

 'Now!' Lara loudly demanded. 

 'He makes me sleep with men. . . for money. In a house on the edge of town. I have to go there and meet. . . men, strangers,' she managed to say, then broke. 

 

 Her forehead bumped the desk with silent tears pooling on it. Her whole body seemed to crumple, like a discarded can. Bernice pulled some tissues from a box and tried to mop up the mess of running makeup. 

 'Leave her! Don't say anything to anyone. I'll sort the bastard out, you hear me?' 

 'Yes,' the teacher mumbled. 

 Lara pulled Bernice from the classroom and told her. 'Go on, get back to class, or whatever you're supposed to be doing.' 

 Jim was waiting by the lockers, wondering where she had been. She felt sorry for the teacher, and even more afraid of Lara than she had been. Bernice began to recounted what happened, but he stopped her. 

 'Break times nearly over,' he complained. The hurried outpouring was cut short. 

 

 'Wait, someone might overhear you. We need to go somewhere quiet,' he told her. 

 They set off for the sports storeroom, hoping it would be free, and it was. They settled on a pile a mats, hand in hand. 

 'So tell me, what happened?' Jim asked. 

 Bernice hurriedly went through the events with Lara and the teacher. Mention of her panties reminded her she still gripped them in one hand. She dropped them on the floor as though they were a dirty rag. 

 'So we were right, she's been whoring for Greg!' Bernice concluded. 

 'Bloody hell! I guess once he had sex with her, she was blackmailed into it. After the first time she did what he told her, so then he had even more on her,' Jim said, in wonder at the guys nerve. 

 'What's Lara going to do about it?' he asked. 

 'Don't know. She seemed to think it was possible to fix him,' she said. 

 'Why? I don't understand why she would bother,' he queried. 

 'She'll have another teacher under her thumb, that's why,' she pointed out. 

 'This is a really shit school!' Jim emphatically sighed. 

 He put both arms around her and started kissing her. 

 'Not now, we've got to get back to class,' she complained. 'Mmmm, that's nice.' 

 His kisses were tickling her neck and ears. 

 He whispered to her, 'We can't go in now, we're late. No one will miss us.' 

 'No more, that's too nice,' she murmured. 

 Their lips met for a long smooch. With tongues entwined they became oblivious of where they were, or what they were doing. Instinct took over, guiding their hands and lips. She tried to close her legs, not wanting to go too far in such a dangerous place. Trapping his hand between her thighs wasn't a good idea. 

 His fingers had learnt what to do. Finger tips pressed and stroked her lips. It wasn't possible to say she didn't want to, for he could feel how wet she was. Her lips were opening up to the insistent pressure. She needed to break away before it was impossible to stop herself, or him. 

 A firm touch to her swollen bud had her gasping. He had discovered her weaknesses too well. He knew exactly how to touch her, and how to excite her, and bring her to a state of helplessness. Her legs fell apart in surrender. His hand cupped her sex, with a finger massaging her clit. 

 She heard herself mewling like a pathetic beast. For a split second her husband's taunting observation flittered through her mind - she became a helpless slut when excited. It was true! The thought passed when she fell back in his arms, and he tried to roll on top of her. She struggled, and managed to get on top of him. 

 She sat astride of him for a moment, lifted herself up, and lowered her sex onto the head of his cock. For a moment she wondered what in hell she was doing. The resolve of earlier, to cool him down, didn't last long. 

 'I'm your slut, Jim. I'm going to ride you until you cum. Lay back and enjoy,' she purred. 

 He keenly watched her body slowly lowered onto his penis. His hardness was disappearing into her inch by inch. When she had consumed it all, he looked up to see her eyes firmly shut. She was licking her lips, and squeezing her nipples. She was hotter than a volcano, and his cock was burning, ready to shoot red hot lava into her. 

 At the same moment they both exploded. His sperm shot into her, pushing her over the edge into an energising series of quakes. It shot through her body tingling her all over. She sat on his hips, holding onto his cock, needing to feel it inside. Her chin fell onto her chest. It looked as though she were deflating, crumpling onto his body, ready to sink into him, for them to become one. 

 He reached up and pulled her onto his chest. She let out a little whimper of regret on feeling his cock pulled from her body. She lay her head on his chest, feeling it thump, listening to his heart pounding. 

 She should have felt some guilt over skipping classes. She should have felt a big regret over having sex in school. It should have been a massive regret having sex with a young guy, when she was a mature, married woman. To avoid the pain of guilt, and all the wrong she had committed, she had to believe she was just an adolescent, without the overburdening responsibilities of maturity. 

 They lay in each other's arms for awhile, bathing in the afterglow of a satisfying orgasm. Slowly they came around to where they were and how dangerous it was. Anyone could walk in on them. As lovers they didn't care. They petted pleasantly, not needing to talk. 

 Bernice was happy to lay in his arms for awhile. She stroked his face, while they simply smiled at each other. A wicked grin was shared. She felt his cock becoming hard against her thigh. Her panties were still pushed aside from when she mounted him. 

 'No! Not again!' she complained. 

 She held him away from her ears and neck, knowing he could overcome her resistance given the slightest chance. His kisses would have her opening her mouth to him, then her legs would part. 

 'You've made me feel young and carefree again. You make me forget my problems. I'm falling in love with you so deeply I don't care about anything anymore,' she revealed. 

 He was about to ask her what problems she had, but a more urgent question came to mind. 

 'I should have asked. . .' Jim started to say, and felt too embarrassed to continue. 

 'What? You're not just my boyfriend, your my lover. You can ask me anything,' she smoothly said. 

 'Are you on the pill?' he hesitantly asked. 

 'Yes. Susan put me on the pill,' she giggled. 

 As a mature woman it had been humiliating having that young girl make such a personal decision for her. It had made her feel stupid and helpless. Now she was glad to have submitted to such an indignity. She was grateful to the girl, as now she could throw caution to the wind. 

 He hadn't thought about it before. Susan was supposed to be her aunt, yet sometimes Bernice seemed older. It was of course possible, but then why did she yield to her so much? There again, he didn't know why Bernice was in this school. 

 He suspected, and Susan had hinted, it was because she couldn't control her sexual urges with boys. Hence she had been put on the pill. He looked at her, knowing she couldn't resist him. He knew how to work her up until she was like a bitch in heat, and that was fine by him. She certainly knew more than he did, but he was glad to learn from her. 

 There was a sink in the corner for washing the sports equipment. They cleaned themselves up as best they could. They hugged and kissed for awhile, then left the storeroom. They collected lunch from their lockers, and ate while talking about nothing and everything. They both avoided the subject of family. 

 Bernice walked back into class after lunch. She sat next to Lobelia, one of the girls she had become friendly with. 

 'You've been with Jim then,' she stated. 

 'How did you know?' Bernice asked, and flushed red like a traffic light. 

 'The wet patch at the back of your skirt,' she laughed. 

 'Did anyone else notice?' she quietly asked. 

 'Everyone,' Lobelia pointed out, purposely not sparing Bernice's blushes. 

 Bernice squirmed on the hard seat, feeling her panties squish with his sperm. Damn! Whatever was showing was getting worse. 

 'They'll taunt me after class,' she complained. 

 'Don't worry about that, they won't dare. You're under Lara's protection, and they all know it. Besides, they're jealous, and want to know all about it,' Lobelia reassured her. 'Here, stuff this in your panties.' She gave Bernice a handful of tissues. 

 As subtly as she could she pushed them under her, hoping to mop up the mess. 

 *** 

 With Bernice out of the way it was easy for Paul to gather information about the department she ran. Travelling to other offices around the country merely confirmed his conclusions. A trip to head office was next, where he would make a presentation to the CEO. The expensive management would be let go, and that included Bernice. 

 Susan reported on the phone that she was still looking after the woman. He wondered why Bernice was still going to school and hadn't simply gone home. He chuckled over how she had trapped herself into the situation when they first met. 

 She had been too ashamed to admit she was a married woman, when he found her cavorting with those boys in the woods. He pretended to mistake her for an adolescent schoolgirl, and she went along with it. 

 He hadn't meant to keep up the pretence for so long. It was all a ruse to keep her out of her office. A few days more and the presentation would be made, so he could go home, and set things right. 

 She would soon lose her job. Her husband had walked run off with a woman he worked with. He'd used the mortgage payments on entertaining her and setting up a new life. The house was repossessed so she didn't even have a home to go back to. He felt sorry for her and wondered what to do with her. 

 *** 

 Paul walked in on his niece and Bernice chattering in the kitchen. He was shocked at how much she had changed. She was no longer acting like an adolescent, she had become one. 

 'Uncle Paul, like it's so good to see you, yea?' Bernice beamed at him. 

 'How have you been? Has Susan looked after you?' he asked. 

 'OK, I guess,' Bernice shrugged. 

 'Be a good girl and go to your room, I want to talk to Susan,' he said. 

 'What's been going on here? She's, err, different,' he said. 

 'I was going to ask you the same thing,' Susan said, looking at him meaningfully. 

 She wanted answers, which he didn't want to go into. Susan was curious as to why this woman was acting the way she was. He couldn't explain it himself, so what could he say. 

 'She's a married woman, Paul. Why is she going to school, and acting this way? What are you two playing at?' she demanded to know. 

 'I need a cup of coffee,' he said. 

 Not having to look at her while she fixed coffee helped. 'Her husband left her, and other things left her feeling vulnerable. She's regressed to being an irresponsible adolescent. It seems to have got out of hand,' he mused. 

 'It makes some sense I guess. Depends on what the other problems were,' Susan pointed out. When Paul didn't offer anything else, she filled in the gap. 'A problem with men?' she asked, and put a cup in front of him. 

 'Something like that. Has she been a problem, anything to do with boys?' he asked.  

 

 

===

'She has a boyfriend, and that seems to keep her out of trouble,' Susan said. 

 'What do you mean?' he asked. 

 'She brings him back here,' Susan said. 

 'What? To her room? Why did you let her do that?' he crossly asked. 

 'She's an adult and can make her own decisions, maybe,' she said. 

 'Maybe is right. I guess so. Do they have sex?' he asked. 

 She didn't answer him, but gave him an old fashioned look. Damn! Bernice was a married woman, sleeping with a boy from school. What in hell was he going to do with her? He hadn't expected her to last long in that school. She was too old and looked it when she was dressed in business attire. In the kitchen just now she looked young enough, and acted the part too well. 

 'Does she always talk and behave like that?' he asked. 

 'Like a kid you mean, yes, she does,' Susan said. 

 It looked as though he would have to keep up the pretence until figuring out what to do with her. They were both caught up in a web of lies. Bernice now believed in the farce, or so it looked. He went to her bedroom to try and figure out what to do with her. 

 'How are you?' he asked. 

 'OK,' she said, and continued to leaf through a girly magazine. 

 'School alright?' he asked. 

 'Yea. Oh! I forgot, like, I'm going to be in the school play, fab, eh?' she enthused. 

 'That's great. What part to do you play?' 

 'It's all about a girl who runs away from home and gets into trouble. I'm her friend, and let her stay at my place,' Bernice gleefully told him. 

 'That's nice, sounds great. Is your boyfriend in the play?' he asked. 

 'Yea, it's like funny, cause he's my boyfriend in the play,' she said, then realised she'd admitted having a boyfriend. 

 'It's OK. You're entitled to see who you like,' he said. 

 'Sure it's OK? Like, you don't mind, uncle?' she asked. 

 'Sure it's OK. You are careful aren't you,' he said, before he'd realised what he was saying. 

 'Yea, of course. Like really, Susan put me on the pill,' she returned. 

 'Oh! OK then, I guess. Is he nice, does he treat you well?' he asked. 

 'Your cool, uncle Paul! He's fab. He cares about me, like really. He's gentle, you know.' 

 Paul wasn't too sure he wanted to know what she meant. He had been dragged into the conversation, responding as though she were his young niece. 

 'I care about you too. I want to do what's right for you.' He sat on the bed next to her. 

 'Your house is up for sale. It means you don't have a place to go to,' he clumsily said. 

 The look of pain on her face had him responding, by putting an arm around her. 

 'It's OK! You can stay here for as long as you like. I'll look after you, promise,' he said. 

 She wrapped her arms around him, hugging him tight. 'Thank you uncle. You've been so kind to me, I promise to be a good girl,' she said. 

 The little girly voice was more pronounced than before. He was drawn to the expressive sincerity. He wanted to protect her, though what from, he was unsure about. It was so difficult to think of her as a mature woman, pretending to be young again. She had carved out the role for herself from necessity, then found it convenient, and comforting. At least that was what he figured, and what he told Susan. 

 'When are you seeing your boyfriend? What's his name?' Paul asked. 

 'Seeing Jim tomorrow. Didn't think you would approve so he stayed away,' she demurely said. 

 'I'd like to meet him. I'm sure he's a nice lad, if you picked him,' he smiled at her. 

 'He is. Thanks for everything uncle. You're so cool,' she said, and kissed his cheek. 

 'Well, you had better do some studying, or something,' he awkwardly said. 

 In the doorway he turned to look at her. She looked up at him, and gave him a big smile. He hadn't notice before, but her hair and makeup was in the style of a young girl. She was in her twenties, but with baby-face features she got away with it. The flat shoes and short skirt fitted the image, which she had carefully crafted over the last three weeks. Someone who didn't know here wouldn't look too closely so they would be fooled. 

 'Be good,' he said, and gave her a smile. 

 'Like yea, uncle. I'm your happy little girl, uncle,' she giggled. 

 In some ways it was disturbing. As an act it was good, but she believed it, which was bad. So, what to do with her now?  

 

 

===

Bernice couldn't face up to a series of traumatic events that occurred over the last few weeks. She'd been caught having sex with a group of boys, lost her job, her husband had sold the house, and he ran off with his lover. 

 When mistaken for an adolescent, she continued the pretence to escape the consequences of her misbehaviour, and the trauma of events. She hadn't anticipated being trapped in the role, or being sent back to school. Although she was twenty-four, it was easy to act like an adolescent with fellow students to mimic. She sank into a familiar role in the classroom, acting like a schoolgirl, which had been natural enough a few years ago. 

 Susan had been asked by her uncle, Paul, to look after Bernice while he was away. She was only nineteen, and enjoyed manipulating a mature woman. She kept her off balance by treating her like a naughty teenager, and found it amusing driving her deeper into acting like an adolescent. 

 *** 

 'It's Saturday morning Bernice, no school, you should be in a good mood. Spit that gum out, and eat your breakfast,' Susan cajoled Bernice. 

 'I'm not hungry. Like, really, I want to go and see Jim,' Bernice sullenly spoke. 

 'Have you tidied your room?' Susan asked. 

 'It's all right,' she mumbled. 

 'Does that mean you have, or you haven't? Don't bother. Eat your breakfast and I'll check for myself. Don't you dare leave the table, young lady!' Susan warned the woman. 

 Marching back into the kitchen, Susan looked at the woman acting like a sullen girl, and couldn't help laying down the law. 

 'Your room is a mess. You didn't wash the dishes last night, or take out the trash, and your homework isn't finished. Do you want a spanking, girl?' 

 'No! You're not my mother, you can't,' Bernice complained. 

 She folded her arms under her breasts, and pouted in defiance. 

 'You want this, don't you? No pill, means no naughty games with your boyfriend,' Susan baited her. 

 'You can't do that! I need the pill,' she said, with an anguish laden voice. 

 'Do you want me to tell Paul you've been a naughty girl?' Susan warned. 

 'No! Don't you dare! You bitch,' she murmured. 

 Susan was standing over Bernice, becoming all the more frustrated with her. 

 'That's it, you're grounded. You will not be going out with Jim this weekend,' Susan angrily said. 

 'You can't make me!' she growled. 

 'Stand up!' Susan demanded. 

 Susan pulled her off the chair, and sat down on it. She pulled Bernice over her lap and slapped her panties. In a temper she pulled the woman's panties down, and slapped her bare ass. 

 For the first two swipes, Bernice waggled her legs, trying to wriggle off Susan's lap. Figuring out it would be over as soon as she capitulated, she stopped squirming. A few more hard slaps and Susan came to her senses. 

 Damn! The woman's silly behaviour was having an effect upon her too. Susan was behaving like her own mother. Susan reminded herself Bernice wasn't a girl, she was a married woman, behaving like an adolescent. Her uncle Paul told her how it accidently started, but that didn't explain why the woman was carrying it on so effectively. 

 Susan pulled Bernice onto her lap, to cuddle the sobbing woman. Bernice was trying to escape from the adult responsibilities thrown at her recently, by regressing back into adolescents. Susan was beginning to understand, and have sympathy for the poor woman. 

 'What's the matter Bernice. Are you having trouble with Jim?' Susan sympathetically asked. 

 'No. He's nice, and makes me happy,' she sobbed. 

 'What about school, are you being bullied?' she asked. 

 'Sort of,' Bernice murmured. 

 'Tell me all about it, I want to help,' Susan quietly spoke. 

 'At first there was a bully. I've joined a gang, for protection. It's OK now. They look after me,' she sobbed. 

 Bernice continued relating what was happening in school, leaving nothing out. 

 Susan listened to the woman's outpouring, trying to make sense of it. It was surprising to hear that a teacher was having sex with a student. That he blackmailed the teacher into being his whore was shocking! The school was a last chance for delinquent rich kids. Parents paid the school to take their offspring, when no other school would. In some cases, where the parents paid enough, the school would take them on to avoid criminal charges. 

 It was the only school that would take Bernice, who looked barely young enough to be accepted as seventeen, even though she was twenty-four. The principal only accepted her because he knew Paul, and owed him a favour. 

 'That's appalling, darling,' Susan said, while cuddling her. 'We can't let you go to that terrible school.' 

 'It's OK, really. Like, I've settled in, yeah? I'm doing alright in class, and made friends,' she quickly said. 

 She didn't mention the real reason for going to school was to meet up with Jim. 

 'If you really want to stay there, I guess you can,' Susan reluctantly agreed. 

 'You won't tell uncle Paul will you? Please,' she humbly implored. 

 'He needs to know what's going on. He's responsible for you,' Susan pointed out. 

 'Please, Susan, I don't want him cross with me. I've nowhere else to go. I'm completely alone,' she sniffed. 

 'You've got Paul and me to look after you, darling. You've got Jim, he makes you happy,' Susan comforted her. 

 'Yes, thank you Susan, you do look after me. Like, you're real nice. You let Jim stay here, and like, you know. I'm sorry, really I am, honest. It's good that uncle Paul took me in. I really don't have anywhere to go now the house is sold, and my parents have gone,' she sadly spoke. 

 Bernice was twisting reality, to fit the fantasy world she now lived in. Her parents died several years ago, and it was her husband who sold the house. She'd tried hard to please him, by playing naughty sex games. While she was pushing herself beyond her sexual limits, he was planning on running away with some floozy from the office. 

 'Dry your eyes, and we'll go shopping. If you're a good girl we can pick up Jim, and bring him here for dinner,' Susan brightly spoke. 

 Bernice gave her a big hug, and kissed her. 

 'Talking of Jim, you'd better take your pill. Better to be safe than sorry,' she chided Bernice. 

 'Thank you, Susan,' Bernice coyly spoke, looking embarrassed. 'I'm so sorry for being a naughty girl. I'll behave myself, and do as I'm told, I promise,' Bernice sincerely said. 

 Bernice had been mortified over having a nineteen year old put her on the pill. As she subsided into thinking like an adolescent, and thinking of Susan being responsible for her, it became a routine. 

 It was easy to forget she was a married woman and treat her like a schoolgirl. The way she spoke, dressed, and behaved, mimicked the girls in her class. She was even thinking like a teen now. Susan guessed she would surface from the fantasy world, when she was ready to face the awkward realities of life. In the meantime, Susan was willing to play along. 

 'I'm pleased to hear it. I'm sure you're going to be a good girl. I'll buy you some clothes, something really nice. You get to chose anything you want, OK?' Susan offered. 

 'Like, thanks loads, auntie Susan. You're fab, like, real cool,' Bernice gushed, and kissed her again. 

 They squeezed each other, and laughed brightly. 

 'We'll treat ourselves. We'll have lunch out, and spend loads of Paul's money,' Susan laughed. 

 *** 

 Susan held Bernice's hand as they walked into a store. Their relationship was stronger after the tears and cuddles. Susan had intended buying the woman something more appropriate to her age, with the idea of shoving her out of the fantasy she lived in. 

 'Oh! Look at those yoga pants, they're fab!' Bernice exclaimed. 

 'Maybe it would be better getting something a little older looking,' Susan suggested. 

 'Can I help you? Something for your daughter?' an assistant asked. 

 Susan was wearing a business suit, usually worn for interviews, with the intention of encouraging Bernice back to her usual attire. The idea seemed to be backfiring. The assistant mistook her for an older woman, and Bernice for a girl. She should have been angry at being mistaken for Bernice's mother, yet it made her feel good. 

 She squeezed Bernice's hand, feeling warm and caring. Susan and Bernice looked at each other, and smiled at the assistants' mistake. 

 'Mom, I really like the pants. They would look fab under a skirt.' 

 'OK, honey, go ahead,' Susan said. 

 They looked rather thin and insubstantial to be worn outside, but it seemed that's what seventeen year olds were wearing these days. It slipped Susan's mind that she was only nineteen, and Bernice was a woman. Susan was waiting to start a college course, and in the meantime, Paul had asked her to look after Bernice. 

 'The skirts are over there,' Susan said. 

 Eventually Bernice decided on three outfits, and wanted to wear one of the combinations. She walked out of the changing room in a cropped t-shirt, over a pair of stretchy shorts. 

 'Are you sure about this?' Susan asked. 

 'Sure, it's fab! You don't want to dress me up in girly clothes do you, mom?' Bernice laughed. 

 'No, just something, different. It doesn't matter, you look great. I'm sure Jim will love it,' Susan told her. 

 She meant to put a stop to being called mom, but it seemed to comfort Bernice. She wasn't going to win over the clothes issue either, so gave up. The top was too filmy, and the shorts were too tight. Still, at her pretend age it didn't seem too bad. 

 'Thanks, mom, like, really, you're brill,' Bernice gushed. 

 A surge of emotion washed over Susan. She wished her mother had time from a busy career, to share a girls shopping trip. 

 'I need something to eat. Come on, where do you want to eat?' Susan asked. 

 It turned out to be where friends from school hung out, and she wanted to show off her new outfit. Susan didn't like the way boys were looking at her so called daughter. On the walk there, the shorts had ridden up between her legs. The stretchy material cupped her cheeks, and worse, they formed a camel toe in front. The material for both the top, and shorts, was far too thin. 

 Susan felt old and motherly before her age, and only just refrained from correcting Bernice. 

 To hell with it! The woman could decide for herself what to wear. As a mature married woman, she looked like a slut. As a teen it was almost acceptable, especially to the young guys ogling her. They were nudging each other and pointing, though Bernice was taking it all in her stride. Susan wondered if the woman was a bit of an exhibitionist. 

 After a difficult lunch, Susan left the cafe, forgetting about picking up Bernice's young boyfriend. She was feeling uncomfortable with the way the woman was dressed, and that she was supposed to be looking after her. 

 In the parking lot she bumped into her friend from the pharmacy. 

 'Hi, Susan. I'm glad I bumped into you. I've been trying to contact you. It's those pills I got you. I couldn't get the real thing. They're just dummy ones,' she explained. 

 'What? Damn it!' Susan exclaimed. 

 She looked at Bernice sitting in the car. The woman had been sleeping with a young boy from school, without protection. Shit! Bernice was a married woman. She couldn't get pregnant with a young boy. Her life was already a mess, and this would be a disaster. 

 'You'd better take these. A couple of day after pills, and a month's supply of the pill,' she offered. 

 'A bit late now! Damn! Why didn't you tell me?' Susan angrily asked. 

 'I couldn't with the two of you in the pharmacy. Afterwards, you didn't answer my calls, and text,' she justified. 

 'OK. No point in recriminations. I'll get her to take the morning after pill, and see what happens. There's a pregnancy test here. Fuck! I hope she's not pregnant. Can you get next months pills? Thanks, I appreciate your help,' Susan said. 

 She wasn't happy and they drove home in silence. Bernice caught on to her mood, not guessing how serious it was for her. 

 'Thanks for the clothes, Susan,' Bernice quietly said. 'Have I done something wrong?' 

 'No. It's me. I've let you down, I'm so sorry, sweetie. The pill you've been taking is the wrong one. My friend gave me these, a morning after, and a day after pill. You'd better take one now, and another tomorrow,' Susan apologised. 

 

 'Oh! I see. That's pretty bad, isn't it,' Bernice said, looking shocked. 

 'Go to your room, and let me know if you feel sick or anything. I'll phone Jim and tell him you're not well. Best keep away from him for awhile,' she said. 'I'm sorry sweetie. It'll be alright, I'm sure.' 

 Bernice wandered out the kitchen, looking pale. 

 Susan felt bad. If the woman was pregnant all hell would break loose. Paul would blame her, but that wasn't what bothered her. Susan's mother called her sweetie, when she was younger, and now she was using it with Bernice. It showed how she too had sunk into the roles of parent and child. The shopping trip had been nice, and she enjoyed Bernice calling her mom. Now this disaster had to spoil things. 

 Bernice lay on her bed, thinking about the dire news. All her responsibilities as an adult had been abandoned, leaving decisions to Paul, and Susan. It had been too easy leaving everything to them, and so avoid facing her troubles. She rubbed her tummy, wondering how she felt about having a child. How could she accept having a baby, with a young boyfriend from school? 

 It didn't seem possible. How could she possibly cope with a child. Her entire sense of reality seemed to be changing. It was hard to get a grip on who she was, and what she should do. Leaving everything to Paul and Susan seemed the only possible thing to do. She was just a schoolgirl, dependent upon Paul and Susan's good will. They would look after her, and decide what to do. She trusted them to make the right decisions. 

 Susan heard Bernice retching and rushed to the bathroom. Nothing came up, so she guided the woman back to bed. She grabbed a bowl, and sat close. 

 'You'll be alright, don't worry. Paul and I will help you, whatever happens. You're my sweetie and I promise to look after you,' Susan cooed. 

 She kissed Bernice's forehead, and cuddled her. 

 'It's my stupid fault. I need looking after, and you do it so well. I loved our shopping trip. It was so good being together, like, being with my mom,' Bernice whispered. 

 'I'll be your mom for the rest of the day, if that will make you feel better,' Susan promised. 

 'That will be nice, mom,' Bernice said, as she fell asleep. 

 Susan left her to phone Jim, the boyfriend. It was lucky he picked up the phone instead of his parents. 

 'Hi Jim, I phoned to tell you Bernice isn't well. She's alright, just something she'll have to get through. No, I don't think that's a good idea. She's asleep at the moment, and won't want you to see her looking a mess. Alright, maybe tomorrow, I'll ring to let you know. OK. Bye,' Susan said. 

 The guy was thoughtful, and concerned about her, so that was nice. He couldn't be blamed for the situation she was in. Men never had to face up to these things. At eighteen, he could hardly be expected to take on the responsibility for a family. If she was pregnant, neither of them was in a position to face it. 

 Susan sat heavily in the kitchen with a mug of coffee. She'd only taken a sip, when she heard Paul coming in. 

 'What's up?' he quickly asked. 

 'Bernice isn't well,' she said. 

 'What's wrong, I'll go and see her,' he said, looking worried. 

 'She's asleep, don't disturb her. It's woman's trouble,' she informed him. 

 It was a half truth, but how could she tell him of her abject failure. 

 'Oh! Well, I guess you can handle it,' he said. 'I've got a new contract, and need to write up the notes,' he said, and quickly left. 

 On Sunday Bernice was sick after taking a day after pill. They both hoped it would protect her, yet knew it might be too late. Susan reassured her, and continued to call her sweetie, while Bernice called her mom. It was reassuring for them both. They shared an unspoken thought, that it might be nice to have a baby. 

 Jim was far too young to shoulder the responsibility of being the father of her child. Bernice was still a married woman, and to become pregnant from a young boy would be a blow to her already fragile sate of mind. Yet the thought of having a baby left them both with a warm comfortable feeling. 

 Susan sat on the bed holding her hand, making soothing sounds when she retched. 

 

 *** 

 Monday morning came around to find Bernice up for breakfast, and well enough to go to school. 

 'You sure you're alright?' Susan asked, as Bernice got out the car. 

 'Like, yes, I'm fine, mom,' Bernice said, yet again. 

 Since the weekend she called Susan mom. It started as a joke between them while shopping. From the loving way Susan cared for her while she spewed, it seemed appropriate. They'd shared lots of hugs, when she wasn't being sick, and she promised to behave herself, and not get into trouble again. 

 'Hi, you alright?' Jim asked. 

 'You look worse than me,' she quipped. 

 'I was worried. Were you ill, or just grounded?' he asked, looking suspiciously at her. 

 'Like, I was ill, but I'm alright now. Tummy's a bit sore, where I was being sick,' she explained. 

 'Thanks for that,' he said, screwing up his face in mock disgust. 

 'See you at lunchtime, OK?' she said. 

 'Sure,' he replied, and they departed for their classes. 

 Bernice walked in and sat down as though she had never left high school. She'd left over six years ago, and been to university, and now she was back. It was easy to sink into the routine, and easier to cope a second time around. Most of the students couldn't be bothered, but she enjoyed the lessons, having come back to them afresh. She enjoyed knowing the answers, and therefore eagerly completed her homework. Having more confidence to join in with the groups of girls was good too. 

 Lunchtime came around and she met up with Jim by the lockers. 

 'No, we can't. Leave it for a couple of days, OK?' she told him. 

 'You sure you're alright? I care about you. OK. Whatever you say, I don't mind,' he said. 

 It looked as though he did mind, yet he was genuinely concerned about her, which reached into her emotionally. 

 A few days went by, and she was pleased to find Jim didn't pester her. Paul asked if everything was alright, and why her boyfriend hadn't been around. Susan helped her with her homework, even though she didn't need it. They tidied up the house together, and shared funny moments in their lives. 

 Susan was trying to get her to talk about her past life, with the idea of helping her get over the trauma of the last few weeks. She didn't push it, with the strategy of letting Bernice come to terms with what happened in her own time. They became genuine friends, although Susan continued to supervise her as though she were a teenager. 

 Each day the pregnancy tests were negative, and both began to relax. As strange as it was, they formed a bond as mother and daughter. Both accepted their roles, becoming comfortable with the relationship. Bernice needed a caring mother figure, and Susan enjoyed having someone to care for. 

 The usual daily routine was firmly in place, with breakfast, a hug, and Bernice being dropped off at school. 

 'Oh, I forgot, I need my sports kit tomorrow. Can you remind me to check it tonight,' Bernice said, as she got out the car. 

 'No need, it's clean, and in the bottom draw,' Susan smiled. 

 'I was supposed to do that! Thanks, mom,' Bernice laughed. 

 She leaned in and kissed Susan, and they shared a grin. 

 'Enjoy yourself, sweetie,' Susan said, and winked. 

 Bernice understood what she meant. She was referring to kissing and cuddling with Jim, in the sports storeroom. Something they'd talked about recently, though she hadn't revealed they had sex.  

 

 

===

'Aww, mom,' she grimaced, then laughed. 

 'Don't be a naughty girl though, or I'll spank you when you get home,' Susan warned, with a mock sternness. 

 'I'll be a good girl, mommy, promise,' she said, putting on a little girl voice. 

 'Get going or you'll be late,' Susan admonished her. 

 Bernice walked in past the security guard, knowing she was trapped there for the day. It was no longer a scary feeling, rather it felt good. Being in school had become an adventure. She'd made friends, and there was Jim, her boyfriend. She thought about him more than the schoolwork, and still she had good grades. 

 She was a mature married woman, pretending to be a high school student. At first it had been a necessity to push the past to the back of her mind. To survive she'd had to fit in, and behave like one of them. Joining a gang, making friends, and having a boyfriend, were a means of surviving, and she was doing it much better the second time around. The good feeling of being successful and a popular student, made the pretence a pleasure, rather than a necessity. 

 At lunchtime she met up with Jim. Over the past few days they'd kissed and cuddled, avoiding going too far. Susan had given her the green light, by telling her Jim could come over this evening. They were close enough to read each other's minds, so she knew what Susan meant. 

 Bernice pulled away from a long tender smooch. 

 'We can, if you want to,' Bernice said. 

 'Are you sure? Is everything alright now?' he asked. 

 He'd asked her what the problem was, and if he'd caused it, though he hadn't the courage to ask if she was pregnant. She could see that, but hadn't let him off the hook. 

 'Sure. I thought I was pregnant, but I'm not,' she plainly stated. 

 'You should have told me. I wouldn't abandon you. I would marry you, or whatever you wanted,' he said. 

 His sincerity reached inside her, leaving her feeling warm and protected. A moment of reality surfaced. She imagined marrying an eighteen year old boy, and what people would think. She looked at his smiling face, and the thought was drowned out by his love. It might be just a youthful infatuation, but he believed he was in love with her. 

 'I love you Jim,' she passionately murmured. 

 He pushed her back onto the pile of matting, and kissed her more ferociously. His hands were all over her body. She madly scrabbled for his belt and undid his trousers, without thought, just from the need. He pulled her panties down, knowing she didn't like them merely pulled to one side. He rolled on top of her, and she guided him in. 

 'Do it, Jim, faster, harder,' she implored him. 

 He was breathing hard, unable to answer, not needing to. 

 He powered into her, knowing how she liked to be screwed, though it was from his own need. Instinctively he pounded away at her, not really hearing her words, but reacting with enthusiasm to the arousing sounds. 

 'Fuck me hard! Do me, Jim. Pleasure you're girl. I'm your girl, Jim,' she ground out between gritted teeth 

 'Yes! Now, cum now, fill me up. I want your lovely cum, Jim,' she beseeched him. 

 Whether he understood or not, the urgency in her voice set him off. He thrust in deep, and hard. He kept his cock buried inside her, pushing hard with his strong legs, as though trying to return to the womb. His cock throbbed, and pumped strings of hot young sperm into her. After so long without, it felt as though a gallon of rich young sperm was spurting past his one eye. She felt as though he were filling her entire body with potent sperm. 

 He collapsed on top of her. They lay there sated, breathing heavily. 

 Miss Perez walked in and came to a halt. Her eyes widened in anger. She strode over to the recovering pair, looming over them. 

 'Get your clothes on, and follow me, NOW!' she shouted. 

 'Miss Perez, it's my fault!' Bernice yelped, in fear. 

 'I'm in no doubt of that! As I told you before, you are a slut, girl,' Miss Perez heavily stated. 

 'You boy, go to your class, or wherever you're supposed to be,' she ordered. 

 'Just go,' Bernice implored Jim. 'I'll be alright,' she reassured him. 

 Jim reluctantly left the sports store, looking over his shoulder, eyeing both of them. She'd told him about Miss Perez some time ago, and he figured she could win her around again. He just hoped the price she had to pay wasn't too nasty. He hung around outside, in case she needed him. 

 Miss Perez took a hold of an ear, and walked toward the door. Bernice meekly followed her toward the main school building, while glancing at Jim, trying to tell him to keep away. At the principal's office they found he was out. With her anger abating, she took the girl to the welfare office, hoping to at least find that stupid woman in. 

 'Sit there. I don't expect much from that one, but when the principal returns I'll make sure you're punished,' Miss Perez told her. 

 A woman called Bernice into her office. Julie sat behind a desk, making Bernice stand before her. 

 Bernice was a married woman, and an adult, dressed as a teenager. Nevertheless, she looked as scared as a teenager should be. She no longer had the natural authority of a mature woman, and couldn't stand up to this younger woman. If she did, it would only make matters worse. She was about to be punished for having sex with a boy in school, which frightened her, and kept her in place. 

 'I don't think we've met before. My name is Miss Kent. Miss Perez is right, you are in trouble young lady. The principle might expel you,' she began. 

 'Please, Miss, I like the school, I don't want to be expelled. I can't let my uncle and Susan down,' Bernice interrupted. 

 She liked the school? That was a first. Not even the teachers liked the damn place. There were too many bad cases to manage, and that was why she hadn't seen this one before. 

 'There are alternatives, if you're sure you want to stay,' Miss Kent offered. 

 The social worker looked at the admission notes, while the girl wittered on, apologising. There wasn't the usual social report most students turned up with. She would have to judge for herself what was wrong, and why the girl was here. There was something wrong with everyone at this school, including the staff. 

 'Please, Miss, I'll do anything,' Bernice sincerely spoke. 

 It's a good job she hadn't promised that to Miss Perez, Julie thought. 

 'It says here you're living with your guardian. Is that right?' she asked. 

 'Yes, Miss Kent. Paul, and Susan. They're like a mother and father to me, and look after me well. I don't want to let them down,' Bernice nervously said. 

 This was a lot different to the unruly students she normally dealt with. There was something wrong with her, otherwise why was she here. She decided to take the trouble to investigate, to see what was at the bottom of it. 

 'You're seventeen, is that right?' she asked, looking sceptical. 

 'Yes, ma'am,' Bernice replied. 

 She felt like a naughty schoolgirl standing before the principal. She'd never been in so much trouble in high school. Discovered having sex in school was dreadful. She felt she would die of shame. 

 'Whatever it takes, I'll do my best to put things right, honest ma'am,' she said. 

 It sounded as though she were about to burst into tears. 

 'I'll have to inform your guardian, will he be at home?' she asked. 

 'No ma'am. Susan will be in,' she added. 

 'It says here Susan is your aunt, is that right?' she asked. 

 'Yes, ma'am. She's like a mother to me,' Bernice sniffed. 

 'Here's some tissues. Go wait outside, while I phone her,' she said. 

 'You're aunt is on her way. We'll try to work something out so you can stay in school, but I can't promise anything. Go to your class, and come back here at end of the day. Be a good girl, or it will count against you,' Julie said. 

 'I'll be a good girl, ma'am, I promise, honest,' Bernice gushed. 

 She scampered off with a feeling of dread, tempered with just a slight glimmer of hope. Surely they wouldn't kick her out of school. Lara had told her she could get away with anything in this damn school. The trick was not to get caught. 

 She'd got caught by the wrong person, at the wrong time. Miss Perez wanted to make her a personal pet-girl, but she'd escaped the teacher through joining Lara's gang for protection. So the teacher had a score to settle, and it looked as though she had won. 

 Susan and Paul met outside the school, and walked in looking worried. They were directed toward the social workers office, and knocked. 

 'Thank you for coming so quickly, I appreciate that,' Julie said. 

 Most parents just wanted their offspring out of the way, so they could get on with their self-important lives. Though these two weren't parents, they were concerned guardians, which was refreshing. Intrigued over why they let a nice girl like Bernice attend here, she decided to get some background information. 

 Paul and Bernice kept to the truth as much as possible, only filling in with lies when necessary. Especially keeping quiet about her age, and being a married woman. 

 'She has a problem with boys,' Paul said. 'Can't stop herself,' he added. 

 'To make a decision about what to do, I need to send her for assessment. All the students have a report on record, but not Bernice. She will be away for at least a couple of days, at an assessment centre,' Julie explained. 

 'What happens at this assessment place?' Paul asked. 

 'They will conduct a psychological review. They could recommend a placement in a rehabilitation centre, or a change in her care. It's more likely they would recommend carrying on as usual,' Julie said. 

 'What kind of changes in her care?' Paul queried. 

 'A different school, or a different environment. I'm sure a change of guardianship wouldn't be considered, though it is possibility. I'm sure that won't happen, as she's happy to think of you as her parents,' Julie quickly added. 

 'Is there some way around that assessment place?' Susan enquired. 

 'As you're just her guardians, it's the rules I'm afraid. Don't worry, it will be painless,' she smiled. 

 'If we were her parents would she still have to go?' Susan asked. 

 'Of course, you would have more rights as a parent. As a parent the rules are different, so it would be your decision. Alternatively, you could place her in another school, which she doesn't want, but that's still up to you,' Julie explained. 

 'Could you give us a moment to talk about this. It's a bit of a shock,' Susan said. 

 'Of course. I'm sorry if I made it sound more than it is,' Julie apologised. 'I'm sure it will go well. It's a legal requirement to ensure her rights are being observed. Just a short talk with her established you are doing a good job.' 

 Susan waited until the door was closed, then whispered to Paul. 'We can't let her go!' 

 'Why not. You heard what she said, it's just routine,' he said. 

 'If they start delving into her mind, they'll find out she's well over seventeen, and a married woman. It will be worse if they think it's all in her mind. She might be transferred to some rehabilitation unit. That means a mental hospital. What if they appoint the state as her guardian? She needs our help, Paul. We need to get her out of this way of thinking, and back to normal,' Susan forcefully spoke. 

 'Shit! I didn't think of that. It's a mess. Shit! Any ideas?' he asked. 

 'We could adopt her. To get around the rules,' she murmured. 

 'Oh? That sounds drastic. You sure? I can't think of anything else either,' he sighed. 

 They called the young woman in. 

 'If we adopted Bernice, would that solve the issue? I mean, with parental rights, could we avoid this assessment place?' Susan asked. 

 'Why do you want to avoid it? It would be an opportunity to gain a clear idea of what is troubling her,' Julie asked. 

 Susan didn't know what to say to that. 

 'We don't want her to have a record on file. She went through a rough patch when her parents died, but she's coming along fine. To have a psychological assessment sitting there in her file, would damage her future prospects,' Paul explained. 

 Julie thought about it for a moment. Was it her wanting to know what was going on with Bernice, outweighing her better judgement? Thinking of the interview with Bernice, and how highly she thought of these two, she changed her mind. 

 'Yes, it would make a difference. I could delay sending through the assessment centre forms. In the meantime you could apply for adoption. I'm sure it would just be a formality, as you've supplied a normal, and happy family environment for her,' Julie said. 

 She gave them a warm smile of encouragement. 

 *** 

 Once home they were quietly contemplative, while Paul made coffee. 

 'Are you sure about this, Susan?' Paul asked. 

 'I don't think we have a choice. We need to help her through this, and not pressurise her. You've seen how she is. She's regressed. Not to childhood, but to adolescence. You had a part in all this, and owe her something,' Susan lectured. 

 'I'm not sure we can go as far as adopting her. It seems too weird,' he mused. 

 'If this gets out, what will it do to your career? Think about that,' she added. 

 'No, forget about that. Of course we should think of her first,' he replied. 

 'If we don't do something, she might end up in a home for mad kids. Or maybe farmed out to strangers to be brought up. They wouldn't know her background, and would treat her like a teenager. She would become fixed in that frame of mind, unable to escape it,' she grumbled angrily. 

 'All right. I feel guilty and responsible. You win,' he said. 

 'Alright, so how do we go about it?' she asked. 

 He looked at her with a grimace on his face. 'There's several problems I can foresee,' he said. 

 He raised a hand to stop her interrupting. 

 'One, she's an adult. Two, she's a married woman. Three, we aren't married. Four, it just isn't right,' Paul pointed out. 

 'You provided a false birth certificate for the school, and she's signed guardianship papers. No-one needs to know she's married. We could get married to provide a certificate,' she quietly added. 

 'Us? You're my niece!' he exclaimed. 

 'Not by blood. You're a close friend of the family, only called uncle because my parents have known you for so long,' she reminded him. 

 He took a deep breath. 'This is all getting out of hand. We can't get married, just to do something that is basically wrong.' 

 'I don't mind marrying you,' she said. 

 He studied her with a penetrating stare. 'You mean it, don't you,' he said. 

 She dropped her eyes away from him, and nodded her head. 

 'It's not just to protect her either, is it,' he said. 

 'Could be someone worse, I suppose,' she defiantly spoke. 

 He plonked himself down on the sofa, close to her. He put an arm around her, to hug her tight. 

 'You're fond of her aren't you. I am too. She's vulnerable and brings out a protective streak in us. I love you Susan, but never thought of you as a wife,' he said. 

 'Why not? I can cook and keep house,' she crossly spoke. 

 'There's more to marriage than that,' he told her. 

 'I know! I don't mind that,' she murmured. 

 'What? No! I meant a relationship. You don't mean, err, we, err, sharing a bed. . .' he tried to say. 

 'We'd be married. It would have to look normal. Isn't that what normal married people do? We'd be her parents and have to behave normally, to give her a chance to recover,' Susan said, trying to talk around her offer. 

 'Susan. Susan, I couldn't let you. Of course, I would, err, welcome, I mean, you're attractive. You're a beautiful young woman, too young. I'm twenty five. You deserve someone your age,' he fumbled around, unsure how to let her down. 

 'You don't want me. Is it Bernice you want?' she demanded. 

 'Yes, no, it's not like that. Of course I want you, what man wouldn't. I've already messed up things for Bernice, and don't want to make them worse. I don't want to mess things up for you,' he said. 

 'I do love you Paul. It was an infatuation when I was young, but now, it's real. I've lived here with you both for awhile, and know how I feel,' she earnestly spoke. 

 'I know you used to have this thing about me. I didn't know you still felt that way. You sure? More importantly, are you sure you want to marry me?' he asked. 

 The serious look on his face made her heart flutter. 

 'Are you asking me?' she said, with a look of fear on her face. 

 'Alright. Let's see what we really have here,' he challenged. 

 She watched him go down on one knee. He took her trembling hand in his, lifted it to his lips, and kissed the back of it. 

 'Susan, I've always cared about you. I'm proud of you. You're a caring and understanding woman. You'll make a wonderful wife, and I want you to be my wife. Make me happy, say you'll marry me, say yes, Susan,' he sincerely spoke. 

 'Yes, oh, God, yes, Paul. I so want to be your wife,' she said. 

 She exhaled, not realising she'd been holding her breath. She fell on top of him, wrapped her arms around his head, and kissed him. They rolled across the floor, embracing and smooching, not daring to let go of each other. 

 Eventually they lay still, panting heavily. Instead of rushing to the bedroom, they had things to say. 

 Paul put a finger to her lips, as though a finger might stop a gun firing. 

 'I can't believe it. I thought about who you might marry, and how I would feel about it. Felt jealous! I didn't dream you would want me,' he said. 

 'Somehow I knew. It was just a dream when I was young, alright younger, but now! It feels so right, and so wonderful, I could burst with happiness,' she laughed. 

 'I meant it, Susan, I want to marry you,' he heavily said. 'It's not a joke, or a convenience, it's real. You do realise that, don't you?' he asked, while searching for the answer in her eyes. 

 'Yes, yes. Oh! Yes!' she laughed. 

 'We'd better prepare for our daughter,' Susan said. 

 'I thought we were going to wait until after the wedding. So you could wear white,' he explained. 

 She laughed, as everything he said was wonderful and funny. 'Not that. Wait until later,' she cajoled him. 

 He helped her up off the floor, and pulled her into his arms. 'Are you sure about this?' 

 'Yes! Even if it doesn't work out with Bernice, we were meant for each other,' she sincerely said. 

 'It does seem right. I've always had a feeling women knew what was happening, before I had any idea of what was going on,' he mused. 

 'Let me go, I need to straighten up before collecting Bernice from school,' Susan said. 

 She only just refrained from calling Bernice their daughter. She would have to give him time over that little detail.

 Bernice got in the car, looking very sorry for herself. 

 'Yes, we spoke to the school welfare woman. Don't worry, we'll sort it out. Best wait until you get home. No, you're not in trouble,' Susan reassured Bernice.

 'It all depends on you, Bernice. We won't do anything if you don't want to. What do you think?' Paul asked. 

 He was hoping she would see sense and squash the idea. He also wondered how that would leave Susan and him. A moment of madness wasn't a good way to start a relationship. He had to admit his heart was ruling his head, yet he had to admit, there was something in what Susan said. He looked at Susan, and his heart skipped a beat. She would be disappointed if Bernice refused. If he didn't go ahead she would be hurt. 

 'Yes! Like, wow! I'd love you to be my mom and dad!' Bernice exclaimed. 

 'Perhaps you should think about it. It's a big step,' Paul solemnly spoke. 

 'Sure, like, really, it's a fab idea,' Bernice excitedly whooped. 

 After hugs and a few tears between the two women, Paul sent Bernice to her room. Paul used the excuse that he and Susan, had to talk about the arrangements. 

 Bernice lay on her bed in shock. The initial euphoria had passed, with stark realties of the situation starting to sink in. Over the past weeks, she had conveniently shut out the dreadful past weeks, as though it had been a bad dream. She didn't want to think about it, for it hurt too much.

She couldn't help it. Painful memories kept surfacing. The way her husband left her, and sold the house. How he had led her along, letting her think she was saving their marriage, while he played around with another woman. It was agonizing, yet it unwillingly surfaced. 

 She was a married woman, an adult, pretending to be an adolescent. She was going to high school, and had an eighteen year old, schoolboy lover. A nineteen year old girl was making all the decisions for her. Now it seemed they were going to take complete control of her, through adoption. The school thought she was seventeen, so that meant she would be under Susan's control for the next four years, until she was supposedly twenty-one. 

 Susan had put her on the pill, and decided if her boyfriend could stay the night or not. The girl had taken over her life, taking all decision making away from her. Bernice would be nearly thirty, while still having to obey a young woman, and deferring to her decisions. 

 They had explained why they were doing this to her. Going to an assessment unit might result in disaster. She could end up being put into an institution, or given to a more suitable couple to be cared for. Having strangers treat her like a child was a terrible prospect. If she told anyone she was twenty-four, and a married woman, they would think she was mad, and lock her away. 

 Paul and Susan were doing their best for her. They were protecting her and looking after her. There was nowhere else to go, and no one else to go to. There was Jim. He couldn't look after her, but he loved her. As long as she could stay in school, she could see him every day. The warm feeling of that thought, brought a smile to her face. 

 Of course she would agree to being adopted. She would have a loving family, an attentive lover, and be protected from the harsh realities of life. It wasn't a jail sentence, it was a second chance. Report_Story
