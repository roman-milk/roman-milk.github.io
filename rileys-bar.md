Riley's Bar
==================
#1 

 

 

===

I was introduced to Riley's Tavern on my first day at Woodbine Industries. As I was dropping my time card into the slot to punch out one of the guys asked me if I was going to stop for a beer with the guys. I felt no crying need to hurry home so I said okay. He told me that the group usually stopped at Riley's and if I didn't know where it was I could follow him. I wasn't that familiar with that part of town so I followed him and it turned out that Riley's was only three blocks from the plant. 

 From the outside it looked like any neighborhood bar, but looks were deceiving. Inside there was an "L" shaped bar the ran the length of the west wall and part of the south wall. The rest of the south wall was taken up by a small bandstand and a jukebox. Booths lined the north wall and part of the east wall. Part of the east wall was a recessed alcove where there were four pool tables and a hallway that led back to the restrooms. In the center of the room there was a fairly large dance floor surrounded by tables. 

 My new co-workers had pushed four tables together next to the dance floor and I wondered why they had put four tables together for only six of us. I took a seat at the tables and looked around as I got to know my new associates better. There was a sexy looking busty redhead behind the bar. The waitress, I found out later that her name was Tina, came over and took my drink order and as she walked away I commented on the fact that the place sure didn't match its outside appearance. 

 "You ain't seen nothing yet" Vern said. "In about ten minutes the crew from the wheel plant will start to come in." 

 "What is so special about that?" 

 "The women who work in the office over there are real party animals. When they show up the jukebox starts up and the dance floor fills up in a hurry. If you play your cards right you never have to leave here alone. 

 "I don't think my wife would care for me doing that." 

 "You can still have a good time even if you do leave alone." 

 I was on my second beer when a bunch of women came in. Several of them came over and sat down with us at our tables. I was introduced to five that sat down with us and almost immediately the jukebox started playing and people got up to dance. In less than a minute I was the only guy sitting at the table with two girls. One of them, Ursala, looked at me and asked: 

 "Don't you dance?" 

 "I'm the new guy and I'm just sitting here and watching to get a feel for the place." 

 "First Rule of Happy Hour is that single guys have to dance with single girls." 

 "I'm not single, I'm married." 

 "I am too, but that isn't what I mean. If you are here alone you are expected to dance with someone like me who is also here alone." 

 She reached out a hand to me and said, "Come on. Time to trip the light fantastic." 

 I got up and danced with Ursala and then with three others before I got up, said my goodnights and headed for home. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As I drove home I wondered why I was bothering. I'd told Ursala that I was married and I was, but it was a marriage that was on its last legs and I knew it. I had been enjoying myself at Riley's so why did I leave just to go home to a deteriorating marriage? The only answer I could come up with was that I would not allow it to be my actions that ended the marriage. When it went down it was going to be Elaine who killed it, not me. 

 I met Elaine at a party at my Cousin Lou's house. It was one of those parties where there was a large mix of people who didn't know each other. Lou's wife Shelly had invited several people that she worked with; there were a bunch that Lou worked with, some friends and neighbors and even a few other relatives. 

 It was my first party in a long time and Lou and Shelly had worked hard on me to get me to come. I'd been pretty much a 'stay at home' since my wife had taken off with some asshole she met while taking evening classes at the local community college. She had come back home three weeks later begging for forgiveness only to be told that all of her stuff was in boxes in the garage and that Goodwill was scheduled to pick up those boxes up on Thursday. I suggested that if she wanted any of that stuff she better get it out of the garage before Goodwill got there. Then I handed her the divorce papers and told her I hoped I'd never see her again. 

 Anyway, after nine months of not dating or going out Lou and Shelly decided that it was up to them to get me back out into the world. What they didn't realize was that I wasn't holed in my place because of any great hurt. I just didn't trust women anymore. At the same time I was going through my divorce with Bev my older brother caught his wife cheating on him with the next door neighbor. I also had several friends who were going through divorces at the same time because of cheating. 

 I'm not at all naïve and when my buddies told me that the divorces were because of the wife's cheating I accepted it - tongue in cheek – even though I knew (or at least suspected) that in all cases it wasn't the wife who was the guilty party, but in the majority of cases it was the wife who got playing with someone else. This led to my avoiding women in social situations and that meant parties that I didn't go to. 

 When Lou asked me to his party I was in a fairly good mood so I decided to go. I was introduced to some people that I didn't know, said hello to some that I knew but hadn't seen in a while and in general walked around and socialized. About an hour after I arrived Shelly came up to me with a tall blond – and I do mean tall. She was six foot to my five eleven and she had the bluest eyes I'd ever looked into. Shelly introduced me to Elaine and then said: 

 "Excuse me. Joan just came in and I need to talk to her." 

 As Shelly headed for Joan Elaine said, "Do you have the feeling that this was just a bit contrived?" 

 "I'm not surprised if that is what you mean. Lou and Shelly seem to have made it their mission in life to see to it that I lose my confirmed bachelor status." 

 "And why is some one your age a confirmed bachelor?" 

 "Long, long story and not one for a party. But what about you? You obviously don't need anyone fixing you up. You have to be holding off guys with a club." 

 And it was true. She was about one hundred and forty pounds and it was very well distributed on her six foot frame. Long blond hair down to the middle of her back and even without a smidgen of makeup she had a radiant face. 

 "Thanks for the compliment, but it is another long story not meant for a party." 

 I changed the subject and found out that she worked with Shelly and Shelly had pretty much twisted her arm to get her to come to the party. Then someone else who worked with her came up and they started talking about something that had happened at work and I wandered off. 

 Shortly after that Allison Collins showed up with some guy. Allison had been married to one of my friends and he had caught her cheating on him with her boss. It pissed me off that Lou and Shelly – who both knew how I felt about cheating whores – would invite one to a party that they had invited me to. Allison spotted me and headed my way with her escort no doubt intending to introduce me to him, but I gave her a look of disgust, turned away from her and then left the party. 

 The next day Lou called me and asked me where I had disappeared to. I told him and he told me that Allison hadn't been invited. She came as Charlie Stone's date and he hadn't known that Charlie even knew Allison. I apologized for my abrupt departure and he invited me to a poker game on the next Friday. 

 When I got to his house on Friday I found that while I would be playing poker with him and four others Shelly would be playing Pinochle with the wives of two of the poker players and Elaine. When I saw Elaine there I cast a glance at Lou and he looked back at me with an innocent expression on his face. 

 An hour into the game we took a short bathroom break and Elaine came up to me. 

 "For what it is worth I didn't know you were going to be here tonight." 

 "Not surprising. No one mentioned to me that there would be ladies here tonight either. I do have to wonder why Lou and Shelly are so determined to stick you with me." 

 "Actually I know why." 

 "The please share it with me." 

 Just then Lou came and got me because they were ready to start and it was my deal. I took my place at the table and forty minutes into the game I was sitting there with an empty beer bottle in front of me and staring at two pair – kings and tens – and wondering what to do. It was five card draw, jacks or better to open, and Hal had opened so I knew he had at least jacks. The betting had gone around the table and then Hal had drawn two cards and then bet again. Did he have three of a kind to draw to or had he done what he sometimes did when he had a high pair and an ace and kept the ace as a kicker? 

 And had he helped himself in the draw? 

 And then there was his pair. It was jacks or better so he could have had jacks, queens, the other two kings or aces. 

 When Hal bet Harv had called. Harv had drawn three so that meant that he felt he could at least beat Hal's openers and knowing the way Harv played he probably felt he could beat Hal's openers and any help Hal might have gotten in the draw. Next was Sam. He had drawn one card and when the bet got to him he raised. Sam was known to draw to inside and open ended straights and four card flushes. Was it one of those and he had hit on the draw or did he have two pair and one of those pair higher than jacks? Plus, Sam had been known to bluff. 

 I was contemplating raising when an arm went by me and a hand picked up my empty beer bottle and then set a full one down in front of me. I turned and saw Elaine standing there smiling at me. I don't know why, but I took that as an omen and I called the bet and then raised. Lou dropped out and both Hal and Sam called. I put down my two pair and Hal muttered "shit" and threw in his cards. Sam smiled and laid down a heart flush. So much for Elaine being a sign. 

 Hal, Dave and Jim called it a night and since I didn't care much for three handed poker I called it a night too. Elaine was getting ready to go also and on a whim I asked her if she would like to stop for coffee somewhere. 

 "I could do that" she said. "How about the White Castle at Grant and Steele?" 

 "Ten minutes?" 

 "See you there." 

 After we sat down and had coffees in front of us I said, "Earlier I said I wondered why Lou and Shelly were trying so hard to stick you with me and you said that you knew. Care to enlighten me?" 

 "Shelly thinks I need you or more accurately I need what you are." 

 "You need what I am?" 

 "A nice guy. Shelly thinks that what I really need is to meet a nice guy." 

 She saw the questioning look on my face and went on. "Shelly is a real close friend and as a result she knows a lot about me and my personal life. My fault; I can't hide anything and when she sees me down in the dumps she asks why and I end up telling her." 

 "What does that have to do with me?" 

 "To put it bluntly, the guys I seem attracted to and end up with usually turn out to be assholes. I've had so many of them that I'm down on men in general. Shelly keeps telling me that I need to meet a nice guy and since I seem incapable of finding one on my own Shelly has decided to do it for me. You are her pick." 

 "I suppose that I should be flattered that Shelly thinks that I am a nice guy, but I'm not all that sure that she is that good of a friend if she is trying to saddle you with me." 

 "Why is that? What is wrong with you that getting us together wouldn't be a good thing for me?" 

 "Because I'm pretty much down on women" and I told her about my ex and all of the other cheating whores I'd seen and knew about. "I just don't trust women anymore and it is hard to have a relationship when you go into it all ready expecting it to turn sour." 

 "Maybe that's why Shelly thinks we are a pair. What you have said about women pretty much sums up the assholes I've been going out with. Every single one of them cheated on me and then acted like it was no big thing. Maybe Shelly figures that since we have both been there and felt the pain that it isn't likely that we would ever inflict that pain on each other." 

 That sounded almost reasonable and the more I considered it the more I thought that Shelly might be onto something. 

 "So how do you feel about Shelly trying to fix you up with a bitter divorced man?" 

 "If she is right and you are really the nice guy she says you are I'm okay with it. How about you? How do you feel about a women who has nothing but failed relationships behind her?" 

 "I think we need to test Shelly's theory." 

 To shorten things a bit Elaine and I dated for almost a year before I asked her to marry me. She said yes and Lou was my best man and Shelly was Elaine's maid of honor. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The marriage was a happy one for a little over six years and then it all went to hell. The job I had at the time entailed a lot of travel and sometimes I would be gone for weeks at a time. I came home from a three week trip and found out that Elaine had replaced me. 

 Not with another man, but with a religion. 

 While I was gone Elaine had opened the door one day and let a couple of Jehovah's Witnesses come in and visit. At first I didn't think anything of it. If she wanted to waste her time on what I considered a stupid cult let her have at it. Then it started to intrude on my life. First it was birthdays. I asked her what she would like for her birthday and she told me that we didn't celebrate birthdays anymore since it was against her religion. Next to go was Christmas. She kept pushing me to join with her and I kept telling her no. I've never had any use for communists, but I believe that it was Lenin who said that "Religion is the opiate of the masses" and on that I agreed with him one hundred percent. The more Elaine pushed for me to join with her and the more I said no the farther apart we became. 

 She had meetings at our house and when I would walk through a room where they were sitting and talking everything would go silent and I could feel the stares on me. 

 We had a real nasty argument one night when I came home and found four volumes from our set of Encyclopedia Britannica sitting on top of the trash cans in our garage. When I asked her what in the hell she thought she was doing she told me that they couldn't be in the house because they contained lies and misleading information. When I asked for specifics I was told that the volumes in question contained information on evolution. I blew up at her and told her that if she ever again threw anything of mine out of the house without talking to me first I would throw her and her stupid assed religion out on the street. Things got even chillier between us after that. 

 Why did I put up with it? Because I loved the silly bitch and I was hoping that she would eventually come to her senses. It wasn't too bad on me when I was traveling, but then the company I was working for was bought out and the new owners did a reorganization that put thirty of us out on the street. My new job at Woodbine was eight to five and very little traveling and I wasn't sure what that was going to mean as far as my home situation was concerned. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 The first couple of months after I started at Woodbine I stopped at Riley's once or twice a week for a beer or two and then headed on home. Things at home were not getting any better and my outright refusal to have anything to do with Elaine's new found religion was just making things worse. Elaine and I hadn't made love since the encyclopedia incident. Any overtures I made along sexual lines were rebuffed with all of the usual excuses women make when they try to use sex as a weapon and I was getting a little frustrated. 

 I started stopping at Riley's more often and staying longer rather than going home. My sexual frustration had me starting to look at the women who came into Riley's and I began to wonder what my chances might be with some of them. That's all it was – wondering – because I didn't cheat on my wife. Never had and never expected that I would, but I was a man and I was going to look, fantasize and wonder. 

 And then on a Thursday night everything changed. 

 The house we lived in did not have an attached garage. There was a walkway from the garage to the side door of the house and when you went in the side door you walked onto a landing. If you walked straight ahead you went down the stairs into the basement. If you turned right there were steps leading up to the kitchen. I had just walked in the door when I heard: 

 "You know that you are going to have to divorce him." 

 The voice was Maria's. She was a Witness who lived nine houses down the street from us and was probably one of the Witnesses that Elaine had opened the door to that first time. They apparently had not heard me pull into the drive or come in the house. Elaine said: 

 "I'm not ready for that just yet. I still think that I can bring him around." 

 "You are in denial Elaine. That man despises our religion. You can see the disgust on his face every time he sees us meeting here. I can tell you from experience that mixed marriages don't work. He will never be one of us. You need to put him behind you. You know our precepts. The man is the head of the household and you are subservient to him. How can you be subservient to a man who despises our God?" 

 "I just need time. He will join with me. I know I can get him to." 

 "I think you are fooling yourself Elaine. The longer you put it off the harder it is going to be." 

 I'd heard enough and I slammed the door and called out, "Elaine, I'm home." Maria was standing and putting on her coat when I reached the top of the stairs. I nodded at her and took off my coat and was hanging it up in the hall closet as Elaine walked Maria to the front door. 

 I spent Friday at work thinking about what I'd overheard and what it meant. To me it meant that my marriage was over. Elaine hadn't said "No way will I divorce the man I love." What she had said was that she was not ready for that "yet." That she needed more time to try and drag me into her cult, but the inference was there in that "yet." If I didn't come on board she would eventually go for a divorce and there was absolutely no way I would ever get involved with her fruit cake religion. 

 But I did get one thing out of her conversation with Maria. Friday night when I made overtures to get something started in the bedroom Elaine pleaded 'headache' and I said: 

 "Not tonight Elaine. I have gone almost two months without making love. I am the head of this household and I have certain rights and needs. Now get in bed and take care of your wifely duties." 

 I think it shocked her to hear me say something like that, but she did take off her nightgown and get on the bed. It was a hollow victory however. She just laid there and let me use her, but I didn't much care. I got some physical relief and mentally I felt good at using her religion against her in almost the same way she had been using her withholding of sex against me. When I finished I said: 

 "From now on we will have intercourse on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Make sure you remember that and plan accordingly." 

 I got off the bed and went into the bathroom and showered and when I came back to the bedroom Elaine wasn't there. She had taken her pillow and a blanket and gone to sleep in the spare bedroom. 

 Saturday morning I was out on the driveway washing the car when Elaine came out and walked up to me. She stood there looking at me until I turned off the hose and turned to her. She looked down at the ground and then back up at me and said: 

 "I want a divorce." 

 It wasn't a shock. I knew it would be coming, but I hadn't expected it quite that soon.  

 

 

===

"Are you sure about this" I asked. 

 "Yes." 

 "Okay" I said and went back to washing the car. 

 She stood there looking at me with a stunned look on her face. It was obvious that she hadn't expected things to go that way. I think she expected me to say something like: 

 "Whoa babe. No need for that. Things aren't that bad and we can work it out." 

 Then she would get me to join the Witnesses with her as a condition of our staying together. I ignored her and kept working on the car and eventually she turned and went back into the house. 

 As I toweled down the car I thought on what had just happened. I loved Elaine, but I wasn't dumb. She had been brain-washed by her cult and that left us no chance. She was now a member of a group whose basic creed was "our way or the highway" and I would never accept "their way." Our only hope was for her to put the Jehovah's Witnesses behind her and it was clear that she wasn't going to do that. 

 I finished the car and then went into the house and got two writing tablets and two pens and went into the kitchen and sat down at the table. I called for Elaine and when she came into the kitchen I pointed at the chair opposite me and told her to sit. I pushed one of the pens and one of the pads of paper over to her and told her to start making a list of what she wanted out of the house. 

 "Why?" 

 "Because we are splitting up and that means dividing up what we have. Things like going through our albums and deciding who keeps what. You don't like Bluegrass so there is no problem there and I don't care for Barry Manilow so there is no problem there either, but we need to go through the rest. You have already shown your feelings where the encyclopedias are concerned so I'll take them. I'm taking my recliner and all of my hunting, fishing and camping gear. You need to make your list and I'll make mine and then we will compare. Where there are things we both want we will negotiate. 

 "Two things to keep in mind. You want this divorce so you take care of it. The second thing is that I can't afford to maintain two separate places right now so unless you move out we will have to share this place. You slept in the guest bedroom last night so you can stay there for now. And on that subject since you hit me with this divorce crap you are released from having to take care of your wifely duties tonight. 

 "Why are you being so mean?" 

 "I'm not being mean. You want out of the relationship so I'm letting you out, but I am not going to get up and walk away leaving you with everything. This is a no-fault divorce state so everything we have will be split fifty-fifty. So let us get busy and decide who gets what. Better we do it than let the courts do it. 

 "You will need to start looking for a job and a place to stay. As long as we are still in this house I'll pay the rent and utilities and once we are living separate I'll pay you six hundred a month separate maintenance until you remarry. Agreed?" 

 She shook her head and said, "I guess, but I didn't expect it to be like this." 

 "What did you expect? You want out and I won't try to keep you in a relationship you don't want to be in. So it is over except for the housekeeping and paperwork." 

 Except that it wasn't, but it was two weeks before I found it out. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I went to work Monday it was with a new attitude. There was no paperwork in the system yet, but as far as I was concerned Elaine and I were no longer a couple and that meant I could check out some of the ladies at Riley's without feeling guilty. 

 That night I stuck around and danced with a couple of the girls that usually joined the group at the tables we pushed together. One of them, Leslie, asked what was the occasion that had gotten me to finally stick around. I told her that my wife had asked for a divorce over the weekend and I no longer felt the need to hurry home. 

 "You don't seem too broken up about it and even if you were the girls here will do their best to cheer you up." 

 And they did. I started stopping after work every night and a lot of the women would actually be dragging me off my chair and onto the dance floor. It was obvious to me that I could have scored a dozen times if I would have put forth the effort, but I wasn't quite ready for that yet. I still had some old fashioned values and while Elaine and I were no longer a couple we were still married. 

 All that thinking went out the window two weeks after Elaine told me that she wanted a divorce. A man walked up to me as I was leaving work one night and asked me if I was Robert McKeean and when I said I was he handed me an envelope and said: 

 "You have been served." 

 It didn't come as a surprise. I put the envelope in my pocket and headed for Riley's. As I was dancing with Leslie I said: 

 "It's official now. I was served with divorce papers today." 

 "Does that mean I can take you home with me tonight?" 

 "Not tonight sweetie, but the day is coming if you are still interested when it gets here." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "I'm still married until the divorce is final and until the day it is final I will behave myself." 

 When I got home that night there were several cars in the drive and I figured that Elaine was having another one of her meetings. When I went to open the door I found that it was locked. I took out my key but it wouldn't fit in the lock. I went to the front door and found the same thing. "What the fuck!" I thought as I knocked on the door. After three hard knockings Elaine opened the door. 

 "Rob? What are you doing here?" 

 "I live here Elaine." 

 "No you don't. Not anymore." 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "I was told you got the papers today." 

 "Yeah. So?" 

 "Didn't you read them?" 

 I pulled the envelope out of my pocket, opened it and found that along with the divorce papers there was a restraining order barring me from coming with two hundred feet of Elaine or the house. I was stunned and then I started to get pissed. 

 "All right Elaine, I guess you stuck it to me good. Just let me in to get my clothes and I'll get out of here." 

 "No Rob. My lawyer said that I couldn't let you in unless you arranged it with him so he could have someone from the court here when you take your things out." 

 "Come on Elaine. Cut the bullshit and let me get my stuff." 

 A guy walked up behind here and put his hand on her shoulder and they way he did it spoke volumes about how well they knew each other. Why hadn't I figured that out? 

 "No Rob, and if you don't leave right now and get two hundred feet away I'm going to call the police. If you try to push your way in I have a roomful of people who heard me tell you to go away." 

 "All right Elaine. It didn't have to be this way. Just remember that you were the one that fucked things up for yourself." 

 I turned and went back to my car and went looking for a motel. Once checked into the motel I got out the divorce papers and read them. Elaine got to stay in the house and I was ordered to maintain it and to pay her one thousand a month temporary maintenance pending the final decisions of the court. I shook my head at that. Fat chance! 

 +++++++++++++ 

 The next day I called into work and told them I would be out for the day to take care of some pressing personal business. I was parked down the street when Elaine left the house to take her mother to the doctor. Her mother had an irregular heart beat and was on blood thinners to prevent blood clots and she had to go in every week and have her blood checked to see if her medicine dosage needed to be adjusted up or down. She didn't drive so Elaine had to take her in. 

 As soon as Elaine was gone I went to the house. There was a basement window that had a broken lock and I had never fixed it. I crawled through it into the house and gathered up everything that I wanted and loaded it into my truck. Since the utilities were all in my name I used the phone to call the gas, electric and phone companies and cancelled service. Then I called the insurance man and cancelled my renter's insurance and the insurance on Elaine's car. 

 I drove over to the landlord's house and told him that I wouldn't be keeping the house after the end of the month. He wasn't happy with the short notice, but he cheered up a bit when I told him he could keep the security deposit in lieu of notice. 

 My next stop was the bank and I closed out the checking and savings accounts. They were in my name only so Elaine couldn't withdraw anything, but I didn't know if her attorney could somehow freeze the accounts or not, but I wasn't going to chance it. There were no credit cards to stop since I didn't believe in running up credit card debt and so I dealt in cash. Elaine didn't work and I handled all of our finances. I gave Elaine a weekly allowance to handle groceries and give her some spending money, but all that had just come to a screeching halt. In short, I stopped paying for anything where Elaine was concerned and fuck a bunch of court orders. 

 I had all that done by noon and I spent the rest of the day finding an apartment and then hitting a Goodwill to pick up some furniture. Then I hit the Wal-Mart Super Store for sheets, blankets, pots and pans and groceries. 

 The next day I was not surprised when I got a call from Elaine telling me that the electricity had been turned off. 

 "Why tell me Elaine? I don't live there anymore." 

 "I called the electric company and they told me that you cancelled the service." 

 "Yes I did. Since I don't live there anymore I'm not going to pay the bill." 

 "You have to take care of those things Rob. My lawyer says the court gave me temporary use of the family domicile and you have to maintain it." 

 "I don't care what the divorce papers say Elaine. If I don't live there I don't pay. Best you get out and find a job Elaine (she wasn't working with Shelly anymore – both of them had been laid off) instead of walking around knocking on doors and handing out your cult's literature." 

 "You are going to get in trouble Rob." 

 "What are they going to do Elaine? Stick me in jail? That just means that I'll lose my job and no job means no money and no money means that I won't be sending you the six hundred bucks a month I agreed to give you." 

 "The court says you have to send me a thousand." 

 "Maybe so, but I only agreed to six hundred that day we sat at the kitchen table and that is all I am going to send. Get a job Elaine. You are going to need one. You have a few more surprises coming your way." 

 "What do you mean Rob? What did you do?" 

 "Goodbye Elaine." 

 I hung up and my cell phone rang almost immediately and I saw it was from Elaine so I just let it ring. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 That night at Riley's I asked Leslie if she was still interested and she asked me what had happened to the "I'm still married" bit. I explained what had happened and that as far as I was concerned I was released. She grabbed her purse and said: 

 "Let me leave first. Wait about five minutes and then meet me in the Safeway parking lot and then you can follow me home." 

 I pulled into the Safeway lot and she flashed her lights and pulled out and I followed her to her apartment. As soon as we were inside she started stripping and led me to her bedroom. She pulled the covers down, got on the bed and looked up at me. 

 "No foreplay baby, let's get right to it." 

 I came rather quickly and apologized. I told her that it had been a while since I'd had regular sex and she told me not to worry because she was sure that I wasn't done for the night. She went down on me and got me serviceable again and the second time lasted a good deal longer and I was pleased that I was able to give her an orgasm. Then I surprised her and went down on her and after a couple of minutes of my working on her clit she pushed me away and swung into a sixty-nine with me. This led to another erection and then she applied the cure for the problem and I was able to give her one more orgasm. 

 As I laid there next to her staring up at the ceiling and trying to catch my breath Leslie asked: 

 "Penny for your thoughts?" 

 "They aren't very gentlemanly." 

 "Okay, a nickel then." 

 "I've been stopping at Riley's for a couple of months now and I've never seen you go out to the parking lot or leave with anybody. All of a sudden you invite me to come home with you. Since I'm no Robert Redford or Brad Pitt I have to wonder about that." 

 "No big secret there. I'm just a bit picky about who I hook up with. You might not be a Redford or a Pitt, but you ain't all that bad." 

 "Picky? What made you pick me?" 

 "You have been coming into the bar for months now and you have never had anything to do with any of the girls who are there." 

 "So?" 

 "Let me give you an example. You know Sherry?" 

 "She's the redhead, right?" 

 "Yes and have you noticed what she does?" 

 "No, not really. I haven't paid all that much attention." 

 "Shelly, at one time or another, has left the bar with everyone of the guys from Woodbine except you. The same can be said about Alice, Mary and Becky. That means that those four have shared at least eight guys between them and those eight guys are not at Riley's every night. Where are they and who are they with on the nights they are not at Riley's? Have you ever heard that when you have sex with someone you are having sex with everyone they have ever had sex with? And you are exposed to everything that they have been exposed to? I'm not the least bit interested in a bunch of promiscuous men. But I'm still a horny female with her juices flowing and along comes untouched, unsullied you. A man who flat out tells me that he won't have sex while he is till married. It is as simple as that." 

 "Can I take that to mean as long as I stay away from Alice, Mary, Becky and Sherry we can do this again sometime?" 

 "Oh yes indeed honey and speaking of again" she said as she reached for my cock, "How are we doing here?" 

 We did fine one more time and then I headed for my apartment. Before I left Leslie's place she told me that she didn't ever want to leave the bar with me because she didn't want anyone to think she was like Sherry and the other girls. We would always leave separately and then meet up and that is what we did the next two nights. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 On Thursday I got a call from Gerald Montrose's secretary and she informed me that he would like to see me when it was convenient. I asked her who Montrose was and found out that he was the lawyer handling Elaine's divorce. I told the women that it wouldn't ever be convenient and I said goodbye and hung up. 

 Twenty minutes later she called me again and asked me to please hold for Mr. Montrose. I told her that no way was I going to hold for him and I was just ready to hang up when he came on the line. He cut right to the chase. 

 "Normally I wouldn't do this. I'd just file the necessary paperwork to bring you into court, but Mrs. McKeean doesn't want to see you go to jail for contempt so I'm trying to handle this the easy way. The court orders contained in the divorce paperwork require you to maintain the principal residence pending the final court decision on your divorce. That means that you need to get the utilities turned back on. If you get that done today I will tear up the paperwork I've prepared for the court. In addition we will just forget about you breaking in and removing property while Mrs. McKeean was out." 

 "Forget it. I'll tell you the same thing I told Elaine. I'm not paying for someplace where I'm not living. I had everything worked out fine with Elaine and the divorce would have been painless for both of us if she had just stuck with the agreement we made. She didn't so fuck her. And I have no idea what you are talking about when you say that I broke in. I have it on good authority that Elaine gave bags of stuff to Goodwill on the day after I had the utilities turned off and I know damned well that it was my clothing and personal items in those bags. Go ahead and bring it up in front of the judge and let's see what he has to say about it." 

 "Then you leave me no choice. I'll file the papers with the court this afternoon." 

 "You do that, but while you are doing that think of this. I'm not paying and all they can do is find me in contempt of court and lock me up. That means I'll lose my job and no job means no money. I knew going in when I told Elaine to handle the divorce I would end up paying for it, but again – no job, no money. Think of that while you are walking into the courthouse." 

 I hung up on him and got back to work. 

 Friday was the last day of the month and I got another call and this time it was from a crying Elaine. 

 "What did you do Rob? Mr. Barker was just here. He was surprised I'm still here." 

 "I told you that I'm not paying for a place where I'm not living." 

 "He says I have to get out since he has already rented the house to someone else. What am I going to do?" 

 "Not my problem Elaine. Go ask those assholes in your cult that told you that you needed to divorce me and don't forget that it was your choice to break the agreement we made. You know, the one where I said I would take care of the rent and utilities as long as we lived in the house together?" 

 I hung up on her and I was smiling when I did it. 

 ++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I went to work and told my boss that I needed to speak with him. I told him what was going on and what I was going to do. 

 "I don't know when they will come for me, but I thought I should give you advanced notice so you can start looking for someone to replace me." 

 "You really going to sit in jail rather than do what they want?" 

 "Absolutely." 

 "I wish I would have had your balls when I went through my divorce. What I can do for you is promise you a job when it is all over with. Good luck." 

 That night I told Leslie what was likely to happen and she told me not to worry, that she would bring me a cake with a hacksaw blade inside of it. 

 It was eleven days before a man caught me coming out of work and served me with papers ordering me to appear in court. The appearance date was ten days away and I tossed the papers in the trash and ignored them. Meanwhile I heard (from Shelly) that Elaine had moved in with two other single Jehovah's Witnesses. Elaine called me half a dozen times, but I hung up as soon as I heard her voice. 

 Nineteen days after the court date that I didn't bother to show up for a deputy sheriff showed up at work with a bench warrant for my arrest on a charge of "failure to appear." 

 To shorten things a little when the judge asked me while I failed to appear I told him that we had been real busy at work and I had forgotten about it. He knew it was bullshit, but he moved on and asked me why I had failed to follow the courts orders. I told him of my verbal agreement with Elaine and that I had no intention of doing anything other that what I had agreed to with her. He told me that my verbal agreement had no legal standing, but that court orders had the full weight of the law behind them. He then ordered me to provide housing for Elaine and pay her the court ordered temporary maintenance including the arrearage. I told him no. I would not do anything other than what I had previously agreed to with Elaine which of course was now impossible since she had broken that agreement. He found me "in contempt of court and gave me fifteen days. 

 At the end of fifteen days I was brought back in front of him and I told him no again and got another fifteen days. After that I went back in front of him every fifteen days and got another fifteen. At the end of one hundred and forty-two days I was released. I was let loose because the divorce was final and there was a new set of court orders and I was told I'd better pay attention to them or I would be back. I just smiled and said: 

 "Save me a good cell." 

 +++++++++++++++  

 

 

===

I had given Leslie the key to my apartment and when I got the first fifteen days I called her and let her know. I knew once I got to court I was going to be there for a while and I had already set things up with Leslie. As soon as she got my call she cleaned out my apartment and put all my things in storage and then she went over to Woodbine and picked up my truck and parked it at her place. 

 When I was released I called her and she came and got me. As I waited for her I read the divorce decree. I was ordered to pay court costs, twelve hundred a month in alimony and Elaine's attorney's fees. I promptly paid the court costs, but that was all I was going to pay. 

 Leslie offered to let me stay with her until I could get back to work and get a place of my own. 

 "You do know what you are letting yourself in for, don't you" I asked. 

 "No. What?" 

 I've been one hundred and forty-two days without sex and I have needs." 

 "It has been the same amount of time for me too and frankly I'm not sure you have enough strength to meet my needs." 

 "A challenge? I like challenges." 

 I'm not ashamed to say that while I didn't fully meet her needs that night she didn't complain about it too much in the morning. 

 I called my brother to let him know I was out and where I was and he told me that Elaine had called him and had asked him to have me call her. Out of curiosity I called and asked her what she wanted. 

 "You are supposed to pay me twelve hundred a month and I would like to know when I'll start getting it." 

 "Well let's see Elaine. I just spent one hundred and forty-two days in jail and I don't have a job. So you won't get a dime until a couple of things happen. One, I need to find work. Two, I lost twenty-one weeks of work and that cost me over nine thousand dollars that I will need to recover. At six hundred dollars a week that means it will be 16 weeks before you get the first dime." 

 "Six hundred? You have to send me twelve." 

 "When we sat at the kitchen table I agreed to give you six hundred and that is all I am going to give you and you won't even get that if you bitch and I go back to jail. Jail isn't a hardship to me Elaine. I have a bed to sleep in, a roof over my head and three meals a day. What will you have while I'm sitting in there?" 

 "Why are you being this way Rob? You said yes to the divorce without any argument at all so why are you being this way now?" 

 "Because you fucked me Elaine. Because you broke the agreement we made when we sat down at the kitchen table to figure out who would get what. I told you the night you stuck me with that restraining order and closed the door in my face to remember that you were the one who fucked things up. Now you can live with it. Goodbye Elaine." 

 To be continued.

I went over to Woodbine and talked to my old boss and he gave me a job. I had to go through the hiring process again and that meant filling out all the applications and other assorted paperwork. I didn't know if it would be caught in the office, but I thought it might be worth a try so when I got to the block where it asked for the social security number I put in the number of my Grandfather on my father's side of the family. He had been dead for three years and since I had been named after him and had the same name and he had been single when he died and no one had put in for survivor's benefits I was hoping that the Social Security Administration wouldn't notice. 

 As long as Elaine and her lawyer didn't know where I worked (and I would do my level best to see that they never found out) he only way they could find me to garnish my wages would be through my social security number which would show that I wasn't working or if I was it was under the table somewhere for cash. If they couldn't find me, they couldn't get anything out of me. 

 I had money. When the divorce paperwork and the restraining order were served I had cleaned out all of my accounts against the possibility that Elaine's lawyer might be able to freeze the accounts or somehow seize them. I didn't believe in credit cards so I dealt strictly in cash. When I got paid I cashed my check and put the money in 'my bank' which was a lockbox bolted to the floor under the rear seat of my crew cab pickup and when it built up to a good sized amount I bought a certificate of deposit and gave it to my brother who put it in his safe deposit box. 

 I stayed with Leslie for almost three weeks while I looked for an apartment. The rather abrupt way I left my last apartment had people leery of renting to me, but I finally found a place where I was able to convince them that they had nothing to worry about. My previous landlord had not been hurt in the deal because the move in deal had been first and last months rent and a security deposit so he got the last months rent and the security deposit as forfeits when I went to jail. I signed a six months lease and paid for the entire six months up front and then I started moving in. 

 The three weeks I lived with Leslie got me to thinking that maybe I should give a more permanent arrangement a shot. I like her a lot, we got along great, she was a good cook and was dynamite in bed. When I broached the subject she quickly set me straight. 

 "I don't want a permanent arrangement sweetie. I'm perfectly happy with the way things are right now. I like you Rob; I like you a lot, but I'm just not ready to settle down. What we have going for us right now suits me just fine. Come on sweetie; let's take it to the bedroom so I can show you just how much I do like you." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Things cranked along smoothly for three months and then one Tuesday night at Riley's when I said "Your place or mine tonight" Leslie said: 

 "Neither sweetie. I went to my cousin's wedding last Saturday and I met a guy. Sparks kind of flew and I think he might just be the one. Can we still be friends and will you still dance with me on the nights we are in here together?" 

 I assured her that we would always be friends and as she left Riley's that night to go home I looked around to see if there was someone who could take Leslie's place. My eyes settled on Karen the busty barmaid. The book on Karen was that she had been a stripper until a car accident had done something to her that kept her from being able dance they way she needed to dance to make good money at it. She moved from stripping to serving drinks at the strip club until she got tired of being groped by drunken assholes and then she came to work at Riley's behind the bar instead of in front of it. There was also a rumor that she used to 'play for pay', but no one could ever confirm the rumor. 

 Karen was a walking, talking, living wet dream. About five four and maybe one hundred and twenty pounds with 38D breasts and long red hair down to the middle of her back. I'd never seen her have anything to do with anyone from the bar, but that didn't mean that there couldn't be a first time. I was personally of the opinion that the rumors and the outright sexiness of the lady kept the guys from trying. They figured that they had no chance at something that hot so they didn't try for fear of being shot down and then being made fun of by the other guys. 

 I started spending my time sitting at the bar instead of at the table with the other guys. After a couple of nights Karen brought up the subject. As she set a beer down in front of me she said: 

 "You do something to piss off the guys at the table? They won't let you sit with them anymore?" 

 "I could sit there if I wanted, but I got tired of straining my eyes." 

 "Straining your eyes? I don't understand." 

 "It is hard to see you from over there. I decided that if I was going to look at you I might as well do it up close." 

 "Aren't you the silver tongued Devil." 

 "What can I say? You are by far the best looking woman in the building." 

 Before she could say anything to that a guy at the other end of the bar called for a refill on his beer and she went to take care of him. It was busy and she never got a chance to do more than bring me another beer, but I did notice that she kept glancing over at me. 

 The next two nights were Karen's days off so on those nights I sat at the table with the rest of the guys and the girls who usually joined us. I danced with several and got what I thought was an invitation from one of them but passed on it. If I was going to get anywhere with Karen I didn't need her thinking that I was just another guy wanting to soak his dick in a hot, wet place. When I danced with Leslie she asked me if I knew what I was doing. 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Oh come on Rob. I know you. You are eyeing Karen and I wonder if you know what you are doing." 

 "It sounds like you are trying to warn me about something." 

 "You do know that she is a part time hooker, don't you?" 

 "No I don't. I've never seen her take any money or even leave here with one of the guys." 

 "Well she is Rob. One of the guys in the front office at work said that she was the best piece of ass that he'd ever had and the only thing bad about the experience was that he had to pay for it." 

 "That could just be some asshole trying to make himself look like a stud by lying." 

 "He had never bragged before and if he has since I've not heard it." 

 "Well I don't believe it. If it was true she would leave here with guys from time to time and I've never seen that happen." 

 "You don't need her Rob. You can have your pick of any girl at our table. They are all interested in you." 

 "Do you remember how we got together? Why you picked me in the first place? And now you are trying to point me at the same women?" 

 "Not all of them are like that. Betsy isn't like that and neither are Carol or Robin. And I've not heard anything bad about Tina. If your thing is redheads go for Tina, but avoid Karen." 

 "I sense that you don't like the lady." 

 "I don't know her well enough to either like or dislike her, but I am pretty sure that she is a slut and I don't think you should get involved with her." 

 "A rumor does not make her a slut Leslie." 

 "Maybe not, but I know that she is fucking Joe (the owner of Riley's) during the day before her shift and maybe after for all I know." 

 "And how do you know that?" 

 "I was in here one afternoon. She starts work at four, but at three-forty she came out of Joe's office and she had that 'just fucked' look about her A couple of minutes later Joe came out and he had a satisfied look on his face and he was pulling up his zipper." 

 "That's hardly proof that they were having sex." 

 "Trust me on this one Rob. You don't need to get involved with her." 

 "You can save me from her." 

 No I can't. Rory wouldn't understand." 

 "The boy has no sense of humor?" 

 "Not where that would be concerned." 

 I have to admit that I did wonder if Leslie was right, but then I thought of that sexy redhead and put Leslie's concerns out of my mind. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next night Karen was back to work and I was back sitting at the end of the bar where I could watch her. She came up to me and asked me what I'd like. 

 "I would like a Pabst Blur Ribbon and for you to have coffee with me when you get off work tonight." 

 "I already have plans for tonight." 

 "Tomorrow night then." 

 "I have something going tomorrow night too." 

 "I'm free Wednesday." 

 "Wednesday is my night off." 

 "Give me your address and I'll pick you up around seven and take you out to dinner." 

 "No Rob, I don't think so." 

 "Okay then, how about Thursday night?" 

 "Give it up Rob. I don't date guys who come in here. It just doesn't pay to have a relationship of any kind with people from the work place. I know. Been there and done that." 

 "No problem. I'll stop coming in here." 

 "No Rob, no, no, no! Got it?" 

 "No. Something worth having is something worth keeping after." 

 "Suit yourself Rob, but understand that you are wasting your time." 

 I just smiled at her. I mean what else did I have to do with my time? 

 I kept sitting at the bar on the nights she was there and after a couple of weeks we had it down pat. 

 "What will you have?" 

 "Pabst Blue Ribbon and a date with you." 

 "One PBR coming up, but no to the other." 

 "You are supposed to be nice to the customers." 

 "You are not a customer Rob; you are a pain in the ass." 

 That went on for a month and might have gone on for only God knows how long if my cousin Dave hadn't proposed to Emily Garner. She said yes and my cousin Tom arranged a bachelor's party. It was on a Thursday night and it was being held at Tom's house. His wife Debbie had graciously agreed to spend the night at her mother's. 

 Tom had prepped us all ahead of time (all of us except Dave) so we would know what was going to happen. I was in the bathroom when the stripper arrived and I was stunned to see that it was Karen. Not knowing how she would react to seeing me and not wanting to spoil Dave's party I waited until Karen had her back to me and then I slipped out of the house onto the patio and found a good spot where I could look in the window. 

 The music was faint when it started, but I could still hear it. Karen strutted over to the chair where Dave was sitting, bent over and whispered something in his ear and then moved back to the center of the room and then she did the kind of professional strip that you would see at a strip club. Once naked she went over and gave Dave a lap dance that had every man in the room (and one guy on the patio) harder than the legs on Dave's chair. 

 As I watched it all I remembered what Leslie had said to me and it certainly looked like she knew what she was talking about. Tom had collected fifty bucks from each of us to pay the stripper and with twelve of us kicking in it came to six hundred dollars. Mike asked why so much and Tom told us that it covered the strip, lap dance and then after the lap dance the girl would give Dave the full treatment. Sam asked what the hell was the full treatment. 

 "One time each in mouth, pussy and ass. She gets seventy-five for a blow job, one hundred for her pussy and one hundred and fifty for her ass. When she is done with Dave she will do anyone else who wants to pay the price." 

 Through the window I saw Dave's pants down around his ankles and his cock pointing up at the ceiling as Karen got off of him following the lap dance. Karen swung around and faced the room and then lowered herself onto Dave's cock and rode him reverse cowgirl until Dave came. While she was riding Dave Tom walked up to her and offered his cock to her mouth and she opened her mouth and accepted the piece of meat and went to work on it. 

 Dave came and Karen moved off of his lap and knelt down in front of him and went after his cock with her mouth. While she was sucking him to get him hard again Tom moved behind her and pushed his cock into her pussy. He sawed in and out for several minutes until Karen had Dave hard again and then she got up, went to her purse and got what I assumed was KY and then went back to Dave. She said something to him, handed him the lube and then got down on her hands and knees. Dave moved in behind her and while he lubed up his cock and worked on Karen's butt hole Harry moved in front of her and pointed his cock at her mouth and she took it. 

 She was facing away from me so I moved back into the house, grabbed a chair, moved it to a dark corner and settled in to watch. For the next two hours I watched as Karen satisfied every man in that room but me. Did I want to join in? Yes I did, but I didn't and I can't even give a clear reason as to why I didn't. 

 Seeing Karen naked was a turn on. Watching Karen suck cock was a turn on. Seeing Karen taking cocks in her pussy was a turn on and hearing her squeal as her ass was reamed was a turn on. That sexy body with one, two or three men in it was a turn on. Yes, three! She took Dave in her ass, Phil in her pussy and sucked Marv's cock all at the same time and my cock was so hard from watching that I could have pounded nails through an oak plank with it, but I just could not bring myself to join in. I don't know why, but I couldn't. It just wouldn't seem right. 

 When it was over and there were no more hard cocks in sight Karen shakily got to her feet and looked around the room at all of the smiling and satisfied men and that is when she saw me sitting in the corner. She walked over to me and said: 

 "Well, now you know. I suppose you expect me to do you for free so you will keep quit about this" and she went to her knees in front of me and reached for my zipper. I pushed her hand away and shook my head no. 

 "No? You mean you won't keep quit about this?" 

 "No. What I mean is that I won't do it because it would be blackmail and I won't do that." 

 "So you are going to tell." 

 "No I am not. It may come as a shock to you, but I like you. I like you too much to do that to you." 

 "Why didn't you join in? You too good to have anything to do with a whore?" 

 "You will never know how hard it was for me to not be a part of it." 

 "Then why didn't you?" 

 "Because I'm still going to be stopping at Riley's and it would be too awkward to see you every day knowing that I had been part of a gangbang where you were the bangie." 

 "That makes no sense. You saw it happen so you will still remember it every time you come into the bar and see me." 

 "I can't explain it Karen; I just know that it will make a difference." 

 "You have been after me for months to go out with you and I know what you were hoping for if I would have said yes. You wanted to get into my pants. And here we are and you are saying no?" 

 I shrugged, got up and wished Dave the best. I thanked Tom for putting on the party and then I left. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I didn't stop at Riley's on Friday night because I'd already committed myself to helping Tom decorate the hall where we were going to hold Dave's wedding reception. Saturday was the wedding and reception and the bar was closed on Sunday so it was Monday before I was back to Riley's. I took a seat with the guys at the table and didn't pay any attention to Karen even though I noticed her watching me. 

 After an hour or so and a couple of dances with the regular girls I moved over to the end of the bar and sat down. Karen opened the cooler and took out a PBR and brought it over and without a word she sat it down in front of me and then walked down to the other end of the bar and talked to the two guys sitting there. When my beer was empty I waited for her to look my way and then I waved the empty at her. She brought me another and when she sat it down in front of me she asked: 

 "What are you doing?" 

 "I don't understand the question." 

 "After Thursday night you don't come in Friday or Saturday and when you came in tonight you went over to the tables and sat down. Now here you are at the end of the bar so the question I had for you is what are you doing?" 

 "Trying to find a balance." 

 "A balance?" 

 "Yes, a balance. I wasn't here Friday or Saturday because of Dave's wedding and reception and all the things we had to do to get ready for them. I sat down at the table when I first got here tonight because coming right to the bar would have seemed too much like an 'in your face' thing, but by the same token staying at the table would have seemed like condemning what I saw on Thursday. I didn't want either of those to happen so I'm trying to find a balance between the two." 

 "I still don't understand. Why do you need a balance?" 

 "Because I'm going to be coming in here and I'm still hot for you so I need to be able to come in here, sit at the bar and look at you." 

 "That makes no sense at all. You say you are hot for me, but you had a chance and you walked away from it." 

 "I didn't have a choice." 

 She looked at me and shook her head in disbelief so I went on and explained my thinking to her. 

 "If you had seen me when you first got to Tom's house what would you have done? I'm betting that all that would have happened was that Dave would have gotten a luke warm strip and lap dance and then you would have split. No way you would have done that gangbang if you had seen me first. I couldn't ruin Dave's party so I stayed out of sight. Did I want to join in? Hell yes I did, but I couldn't because quite frankly I couldn't afford you. The cheapest thing was head for seventy-five and all I had with me was forty dollars and I wasn't about to come up to you and say, "Hi Karen. Will you take an IOU? Then when it was over you offered yourself to me to buy my silence. If I would have said okay you would have had nothing but contempt for me. I wanted you so bad it hurt, but I had to say no if I wanted to be able to come in here, see you, and not have to turn my face away in embarrassment. I need to be able to come in here, look at you and smile and maybe have you smile back at me occasionally." 

 She shook her head again and said, "You are some weird dude" and then she left to attend to other customers. As I watched her walk away I muttered to myself "I am that Karen, I am that." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 After that Monday when I would come in I would spend some time at the tables and dance with the women that joined us and then I would spend some time at the end of the bar watching Karen. It was always the same. I'd take a seat at the end of the bar; she would put a beer in front of me and then walk away. When she brought me a refill she would ask how I was doing or make some other general type comment and I would respond. 

 I didn't know why I was doing what I was doing. I did like looking at Karen and in my mind I was constantly playing back the memory of what I saw on that Thursday night, but given that night there was no chance that anything was ever going to happen between Karen and me. So why did I sit at the end of that bar every night? Because I felt that I had to. I sat there every night before that Thursday and if I stopped sitting there after I saw what I saw on that Thursday it would be as if I was saying that what I saw disgusted me and I didn't want to be around Karen anymore because she was a fucking whore. I just could not do that. I wouldn't let myself run away and I wouldn't do anything that would that would make Karen think that I was just another asshole. I know. It makes absolutely no sense that I should be doing it, but as Popeye the Sailor used to say: 

 "I yam what I yam and that's all that I yam." 

 Then one Tuesday night after I'd been sitting at the bar for about an hour Karen put a fresh PBR in front of me and then said:  

 

 

===

"You don't ask me to have coffee with you anymore." 

 I didn't have an answer for that and so all I could do was shrug. Karen gave me a look that fairly screamed "Asshole" and then said: 

 "I guess you think that you are too good for the likes of me, is that it?" 

 Before I could say anything she turned and went to the other end of the bar. 

 The next evening as I was dancing with Leslie she asked, "When are you going to give up on her? It is obvious that nothing is going on and there are two girls at our table who would love to hook up with you. I know for sure that Betsy would jump at a chance." 

 "I can't explain it sweetie, but I feel that there is a connection between Karen and me." 

 "You feel a connection? Are you sure that you aren't smoking any of those funny cigarettes?" 

 When I walked Leslie back to the table I did notice that Betsy was watching us. 

 Karen ignored me for the rest of the week and when her days off arrived I couldn't help but wonder what she was doing. My mind called up the memory of Dave's bachelor party and I wished that if that is what she was doing I could be there. The one thing that had really registered on me at Dave's party was that either Karen was a superb actress or she really got into what she was doing and I would love to feel that passion first hand. I wanted it, but had no way to get it. By turning down her offer at the party I had put myself in the position of not being able to ask her out without Karen thinking I was trying to take advantage of the situation just to get some free pussy. 

 Karen was back to work and behind the bar when I came in on Friday. Our eyes met as I walked toward the tables that the first arrivals had pushed together and I saw the disgust on her face and I turned back and sat at the end of the bar. She brought me a beer and before she could walk away I said: 

 "Just what the fuck is wrong with you? Where do you get off spouting out that "Too good for me" shit and treating me like pond scum just because I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time? What is going on between us now is your goddamned fault not mine. You were the one who came up to me at Dave's party, went to your knees and reached for my zipper and said: 

 "I suppose you expect me to do you for free." 

 "If you had just smiled at me and gone ahead everything would have been all right. I wanted you so bad that night that I could have possibly killed for you, but you threw cold water on me with that 'free to keep quiet' shit. No way I cold touch you after that and not have you thinking I was an asshole blackmailing you for sex. The only reason I sit here at the end of this fucking bar whenever I come in here is so you wouldn't think that I thought I was too good to have anything to do with the likes of you. The reason I haven't asked you out anymore is not because I think I'm too good for you. It is because of the way you talked to me at Dave's party. I can't ask you out now because I'm afraid that you would take it wrong. But I see that you have taken it wrong anyway so to hell with you Karen!" 

 I turned and walked to the tables and joined the rest of the group. I danced with a couple of the girls, but my mood was a little on the sour side so I left early and went home. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Months back, several weeks after I'd gotten out of jail, my cousin Tom had called me and said that Elaine was asking around to see if anyone knew where I was. I jokingly told him to tell her that he had heard that I'd moved down to Florida to stay with my grandmother at her place in Madeira Beach. 

 "That should keep her and her lawyer busy for a while." 

 After thinking about it overnight I got to thinking that it was a damned good idea. I called Tom back and told him to put out the word that that was just what I had done. I called my brother and asked him to do the same and he said he would let it slip out in a few places where he knew it would get back to Elaine. 

 I called my grandmother and told her what I had done and asked her to cover for me. If anyone called just tell them I was not there right then, that I was working a construction job and would be gone for a few days. She was a little reluctant -- she had always liked Elaine -- but she said she would do as I asked. When I got home that night there was a message from my Grammy asking me to call her. I called and she said that a man had come to her house and had asked about me. She told him the cover story, but she thought that I should know that someone was looking for me. I thanked her and went to bed smiling and thinking "waste your time Elaine, waste your time." 

 Monday when I got to Riley's I didn't even look toward the bar when I walked in. I went straight to the tables and sat down. As soon as my butt hit the seat Tina was there with a PBR. I took out my wallet and pulled out a five and went to hand it to her, but she waved it away. 

 "It has been taken care of." 

 "By who?" 

 "It's on Karen." 

 I glanced at the bar and saw Karen watching so I lifted the beer in a 'thank you' salute and took a pull on the bottle. I danced twice with Becky, once with Alice and once with Mary and then I went over and took a seat at the end of the bar. Karen came up to me and said: 

 "I'm sorry. I've been a bitch and I'm sorry about that. But since lately you haven't asked me to have coffee with you when I get off work I'll ask you. Join me for coffee when I get off tonight?" 

 I met her at Denny's and we made small talk for several minutes and then Karen said: 

 "Did you mean what you said the other day? That you wanted me so bad you would have killed for me?" 

 "I did." 

 "How close is your place?" 

 I was caught flat-footed by that and I don't know what my face looked like, but obviously Karen read it wrong. She got a nasty look on her face and said: 

 "I thought so. I wasn't wrong after all." 

 She started to get up and I reached across the table and grabbed her wrist. 

 "Damn it Karen! Will you cut me at least one inch of slack? You caught me off guard. This is not the way I expected it or wanted it to go. I wanted to take you out to dinner and then maybe go dancing or take in a show. I wanted more out of this than just a roll in the hay." 

 She relaxed and settled back on her seat. She gave me an appraising look and then said: 

 "Why? Surely you don't expect a relationship to develop. You've seen me Rob. I am what I am because that is what I want to do. I wasn't forced into it and I don't do it because I desperately need the money. I do it because I love doing it." 

 "I guess I'm just an old fashioned kind of guy. I want the trappings of romance even if they are an illusion." 

 "How do you see it happening?" 

 "A date on one of your nights off. Maybe Wednesday?" 

 "I can't on Wednesday, but I don't have any plans for Thursday." 

 "Okay then, would you go out with me this coming Thursday?" 

 "Yes Rob, I would very much like to go out with you on Thursday." 

 "What would be your preference after dinner, a movie or dancing?" 

 "I think I would rather dance than sit and watch a movie." 

 "I'll check around and we can finalize things tomorrow night. I'll need a phone number and an address." 

 "I'll give you a phone number, but not my address. I don't let anyone know where I live. I'll meet you at the bar and we can go from there." 

 I dreamed that night about what would happen on Thursday. My mind replayed again that night at Tom's and the thought that I was going to possess that hot sexy body gave me a strong woodie that I had to get rid of before I could fall asleep. 

 The next day I made some calls and found out what clubs were good to go to and then I called Spagnola's and made a reservation for two at seven. I was pumped when I got to Riley's that evening after work. I walked in and then stopped dead in my tracks. Gloria, the girl who covered Karen on her nights off, was behind the bar. I caught Tina on her way to deliver drinks and asked her where Karen was. 

 "Karen doesn't work here anymore." 

 "Why? What happened?" 

 "Joe's wife paid us a visit this afternoon." 

 "Joe's wife?" 

 "The woman hasn't set foot in this place in the last two years, at least not that I know of, but she came in here today. She walked straight into Joe's office and found Karen on her back on Joe's desk with her skirt up around her waist and her panties hanging on her right ankle. I don't guess I need to tell you what Joe was doing. Joe's wife was less than pleased. Shortly thereafter Karen left with her last paycheck in her purse." 

 I called Karen's number eleven times over the next two days and got her answering machine each time. I left messages, but Karen never called me back. 

 To be continued...

For the next couple of days I was bummed at myself for not saying "Just minutes from here" that night at Denny's. When I finally became convinced that Karen wasn't going to return my calls I shook it off and looked around. Leslie had pointed me at Betsy and I thought 'why not give it a shot' to myself. I really wasn't in any mood to work hard at getting something going and Leslie had indicated that Betsy would jump at a chance to go out with me. 

 Tuesday Betsy and two of the other girls were already sitting at the tables with the guys from Woodbine when I got there. The seat next to Betsy was empty so I took it and joined in on the conversation. Phil got up and put some money in the jukebox and when the music started I asked Betsy if she would like to dance and she said yes. 

 I had danced with Betsy before, but it had just been dancing to be dancing so we hadn't talked much. This time it was different in that I was going to try and get something going. I started out with a really corny: 

 "What's a nice girl like you doing in a joint like this?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "You are in here almost every night. Why aren't you out there dating some nice guy?" 

 "I wasn't aware that there are any nice guys out there." 

 "Oh my, that doesn't sound good." 

 "Let us just say that my experience with the so called 'nice guys out there' hasn't been all that great -- or nice." 

 "It looks like I have my work cut out for me." 

 "Your work?" 

 "Yes, my work. I have to defend my gender. It will be my job to convince you that whatever experiences you may have had prior to me were with the extremely small percentage of males who are sub-standard." 

 "I'm going to have an experience with you?" 

 "One can only hope." 

 I spent the rest of the evening dancing with Betsy and when it got close to the time I normally left I asked her if she would like to stop for coffee with me she said that she would like to. Then she said the same thing that Leslie had said. 

 "I don't want to be thought of as the same kind of girl that Alice, Mary and Becky are so would you please leave first and I'll meet you in about twenty minutes at the Town and Country? I don't want Denny's because too many people from here stop there. I don't care even if it is only for coffee, but if they see me leave here with a guy I'll get tarred with the same brush as the girls I just mentioned." 

 "Works for me" I said and then I walked her back to the table, told the group goodnight and left. 

 Betsy and I had coffee and talked and we made a date for Saturday night. We went out for dinner, caught a movie and then hit a club for drinks and some dancing. We got kind of close when we were dancing and since Betsy was a fine looking woman I had an erection from holding her close and it came in contact with Betsy a time or two so she knew the effect that she was having on me. 

 I got her home about two-thirty in the morning and I was horny as hell, but I remembered what Betsy had said about her experience with so-called 'nice guys' so I decided to behave myself. I walked her to her door, told her that I'd had a very nice time and said that I hoped we could do it again. I kissed her on the cheek and turned to go. "Hey!" she said and I turned back toward her. She grabbed my tie and pulled my face down to hers and gave me a long kiss on the mouth. 

 "We will do this again" she said and the she went on into her apartment. 

 I was feeling pretty good as I drove home. Still horny, but feeling good. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 I spent Sunday doing my laundry and cleaning my hovel. I talked with both my brother and my cousin Tom and they both told me that they hadn't heard any more from Elaine. They were pretty sure that she had heard that I was living in Florida with my grandmother. The sixteen weeks I had given her were up so I started sending her alimony. I didn't send her what the court ordered, but I did send her what we had agreed to over the kitchen table over a year ago. 

 I'd send a money order to my grandmother in Madeira Beach and she would cash it and then send a money order to Elaine with my supposed signature on it. I talked to Grandma Estelle once a week and she told me that she had started getting letters from a law firm addressed to me and I told her to toss them into the trash. 

 "They could be important Robbie." 

 "Not likely Grams. Just threats from the lawyer that Elaine hired demanding that I pay his bill." 

 "It could get you in trouble Robbie." 

 "It probably will eventually, but I told the shyster that he would never get a dime from me if he put me in jail, but he ignored me and did it anyway." 

 I knew that eventually Elaine and her lawyer would find me and I spent some time thinking about what they could do and what I could do to counter it. I could only think of two things they could do. The first would be to haul me to court which would only result in me spending more cell time for contempt of court and the second would be to get a court order to garnish my wages. Of course a garnishment would do them no good if I was sitting in jail and not a whole lot of good if I wasn't. A soon as my wages were attached I would quit the job and go find another and then they would have to go to the trouble of finding me again. Short of constantly changing jobs and making them find me I needed to find a way to keep my wages away from them. I had a couple of ideas, but I didn't know if they were workable. I would need to ask around and see what I could find out. 

 The idea I came up with might work, but I would need my boss's help in doing it if it could be done. I explained my thinking to him and he was doubtful that it would work or if it did it would work for long, but he was willing to give it a try. It helped that he had gone through a rather acrimonious divorce himself. 

 The plan was that I would set up a services company. I would get all the licenses and permits and have the company ready to go if Elaine and her lawyer ever found me. The first time I was garnished I would quit and then Rod would contract my company. I would continue to do work for Rod and he would pay my company and then my company would pay me. If Elaine's shyster ever caught on to that my fall back position would be to work for cash under the table. The plan wasn't one that would work for everyone, but then not every one was a bridge certified welder and certified in eight states. 

 The last thing I did was transfer ownership of my truck to my brother so that it couldn't be seized and sold at auction. With my butt hopefully covered I relaxed and got down to the business of enjoying myself. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 I dated Betsy a half dozen times and pretty much behaved myself and took my time. Our kisses at the end of our dates got longer and more passionate. We sat in the car and necked and for a while the necking was so hot the windows of my truck fogged up. 

 I'd just brought Betsy home from a night of dinner and dancing and we were sitting in the truck necking when Betsy pulled away from me and said: 

 "Are you ever going to make a move or am I going to have to do it?" 

 I smiled at her and said, "I remember you telling me your thoughts on "nice guys" so I thought it would be best to let you make your own choices; to let you make the move if you ever got to the point that you wanted to." 

 "Do you have any idea of how many weeks we have wasted? Come on." 

 "Where are we going?" 

 "Into my apartment and don't you dare be so dumb as to ask me what we are going to do there." 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Betsy and I kept steady company for the next five months. We made love three or four times a week and it was always good. Then one night after we had worn each other out Betsy said: 

 "I know that this is sudden Rob, but tonight was our last time." 

 "Why? Did I do something wrong?" 

 "Not at all sweetie; I'm the one fucking things up. You are a nice guy, a great playmate, but we have no future. I like you Rob; a lot more than I have liked any other guy, but I don't love you and the last five months have shown that I probably never will. As much time as we've spent together if love was going to develop it would have by now and it hasn't. I'm getting to the age where I want to go from a single girl to being a wife and mommy and for that to happen I need to start looking for "Mr. Right." I can't do that if you and I are still playing. I'm sorry sweetie, but it is time to end it. Can we still be friends?" 

 She was right and I knew it. We had fun together and I did like her, but there was no spark there between us. I looked at her and said: 

 "We can still be friends, but that means that you have to dance with me at Riley's from time to time." 

 "I can do that." 

 I reached over and rolled her right nipple between my thumb and forefinger and said: 

 "Tonight may be our last time, but tonight isn't over yet, is it?" 

 She reached down and took my limp cock in her hand and said, "Not by a long shot." 

 When I left her apartment in the morning I gave her one last kiss and wished her good luck in finding "Mr. Right" and then I headed for work. As I drove I wondered if I was ever going to find a "Miss Right" and then remembering my two marriages I wondered if I even wanted to. 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

Some changes took place while Betsy and I were dating. Riley's was still Riley's, but Joe no longer owned it. The divorce that happened following Joe's wife catching him buried in Karen had caused it to be sold. The new owner left things pretty much as they were, but he enlarged a storage area and made a kitchen out of it. The new name was Riley's Bar and Grill and the grill had a limited menu. Half pound ground rounds, steak sandwiches, Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches, onion rings and French fries were all that were offered. 

 Murray, the new owner, hired a German girl to work in the kitchen and she became an instant object of lust for most of the guys who came into the bar. Tall, about five ten, built like a brick shit-house and long blond hair. She was the living image of what the Nordic Valkyries were thought to be. She was hit on constantly, but no one seemed to get anywhere with her. Probably because her English wasn't that all that good. Freda had trouble not only understanding what was being said to her, but she couldn't make herself understood either. 

 Murray spoke German and I assumed he probably gave her the job as a favor to a friend. Or maybe she was a relative. She had no problem in the kitchen because the order pad for food had the German name of the product just under the English name. If you ordered the onion rings for instance the waitress put a check mark in the little box in front of the item and all Freda had to do was read the German associated with the box. I was probably the only guy who stopped in regularly who didn't try his luck with her. I was just coming off my relationship with Betsy and wasn't in all that much of a hurry to get back in another one especially one that I would have had to work hard on. Maybe if I spoke German, but I didn't so I didn't try. 

 Betsy and I were sociable and we danced at least one dance every time we were in there together. The only other girl that I might have been interested in was Valerie, but she had just recently become engaged so outside of dancing with her occasionally I behaved myself. 

 Just because I wasn't interested in jumping into a new relationship didn't mean that I wasn't interested in the ladies so I did look around and evaluate the possibilities. Tina, the waitress, was a sexy little thing and both Marva and Gloria were hard on generators. Marva was Karen's replacement and Gloria was the girl who covered for Marva on her days off. There were also a few other regulars who drew my attention even though they never sat at our table with us. Like I said, in no hurry, but making a list and checking it twice and wondering who was naughty AND nice. 

 It was a Friday night and I was sitting at the tables listening to the conversations when Vern, one of he guys I worked with, leaned over and said: 

 "I need a favor Rob." 

 "What?" 

 "I need a wing man." 

 "For what?" 

 "See those two broads in the booth over by the jukebox?" 

 I looked over and saw who he was talking about. 

 I want to move in on the brunette, but I need someone to occupy the other one. You know how hard it is for one guy to hustle a chick when there are two of them sitting together." 

 I took a closer look at the two in the booth. The one that Vern wanted me to cover was a cute looking redhead and I always have been partial to redheads so I told Vern to lead the way. I was surprised at the ease of it all. Vern asked, "May I have this dance?" and the woman (Nancy) said "I'd like that" and she slid out of the booth and they moved out onto the dance floor. 

 I looked at the redhead and said, "He brought me along to keep you company while he abducted your friend." 

 She looked at me with the clearest emerald green eyes and said, "What's the matter? You don't dance?" 

 "I have two left feet, but I have been known to try." 

 She slid out of the booth and said, "Let's go." 

 As she stood up I saw that she was about 5'2'' and maybe 100 or 105 pounds and had a damned sexy body and as she moved into my arms she told me that her name was Candy and then she said: 

 "Why did you lie to me?" 

 "When did I lie and what was it?" 

 "When you told me that you had two left feet. I've been in here before and I've seen you out there dancing and you do not have two left feet. In fact, you are one of the better dancers out there." 

 "Well thank you for the compliment, but I don't really think that I told you a fib. Regardless of what you may think I don't think that I'm all that good." 

 When the song was over I walked her back to her booth. Vern and Nancy weren't back yet and she pointed at the seat across from her. 

 "The deal is you are supposed to keep me company while your friend is off with Nancy so sit." 

 I joined her and we sat there and sipped our drinks and talked. It turned out that Vern and Nancy had never physically met each other, but had talked on the phone several times and had set up sort of a blind date for the night. Nancy was afraid that Vern might not show so she talked Candy into coming along to keep her company in case Vern didn't turn up. Vern did show up and so I got elected to keep Candy busy while Vern and Nancy did 'whatever' it was they were going to do. 

 "I hope it isn't hard duty for you" Candy said. 

 "I'll do my best to tough it out." 

 Somebody pushed the button for "Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress" by the Hollies and I offered Candy my hand and asked "Shall we" and we got up and danced. We stayed out on the floor for the next three tunes and as we danced I glanced around and didn't see Vern or Nancy. The last of the three was a slow number and Candy moved in real close. I had an erection and she bumped into it once. She gave no indication that she noticed. When the song was over we went back to the booth and when we sat down she said: 

 "Don't get your hopes up. I have a fiancé and I don't play around." 

 "I wasn't looking for anything. I'm just here as a favor for Vern and speaking of Vern I haven't seen him or Nancy for the last hour or so." 

 "If I know Nancy she is on her back by now and I'm betting that we won't see either one of them again tonight." 

 "You don't sound like it comes as much of a surprise to you." 

 "It isn't. She's a good friend, but she is also a bit of a slut. When she asked me along to keep her company I knew that if the guy showed up I was going to be abandoned." 

 "I hope she wasn't your ride." 

 "She was, but knowing what was likely to happen I made her give me cab fare before we left her place." 

 I asked her where she lived and when she told me I told her I had to go right by there on my way home and I offered her a ride. She thought about it for a second or so and then said she would take me up on the offer. We finished our drinks and I drove her home. I started to get out of the truck to walk her to the door, but she told me that it wasn't necessary, thanked me for the ride and keeping her company and then said goodnight. 

 Saturday I had dinner with my brother and Sunday my cousin Tom and I went to a ball game. I worked late Monday and when I got off I didn't feel like doing anything so I went home. 

 When I got to Riley's after work on Tuesday I found out changes had been made. Murray had caught Marla stealing from the register and had fired her. Tina was moved from waitress to barmaid and a new girl had been hired to take Tina's place. Jane was a good looking blond, but I noticed that she was wearing a wedding ring and that stopped all the thoughts I'd started having about her. I noticed that there were no girls sitting at the tables when I joined the guys so for the first time in ages it was nothing but drink beer and talk sports. 

 Vern was there and he asked me how I'd made out with Candy and I told him that I hadn't. Then he told me about his time with Nancy. It seems that they spent the weekend together. 

 "Best pussy I've ever had and believe me bud, that is saying something. I think I'm in love." 

 I wondered if I should fill him in on what Candy had told me, but decided to keep my mouth shut. If Nancy was a slut Vern would find out soon enough. 

 While we were sitting there two women came in and sat down in a booth. They were both regulars, but not regulars who joined us at the tables. They were there maybe twenty minutes before one of them got up and went over and fed some coins into the jukebox. She went back to her booth and sat through two songs before getting up and heading for our table. I'd seen her a dozen times, but I had never talked with her or danced with her. I didn't even know her name, but she walked right up to me and said: 

 "Let's dance." 

 Five foot five and maybe 125 pounds and long black hair that hung down to just below her shoulders. I guessed that those 125 pounds were distributed about 36- 23-35 and as I looked into her hazel eyes I was going to say no? I stood up and she took my hand and led me out onto the dance floor. As we danced I found out that her name was Marge and that the girl she was with was Susan. She told me where she worked and what she did and I told her the same about me. 

 We danced for two numbers and I asked her if she and Susan would like to join us at our table and she declined. 

 "Why not? You obviously want to dance or you wouldn't have come over to get me. There are five other guys sitting there with me and that should be enough to keep you out on the floor until you are ready to leave." 

 "No offense, but the girls who sit at your table have a reputation and it is not a reputation that Susan and I wish to acquire." 

 "Then why did you come over and get me?" 

 "Because you are the only one at that table who doesn't get up and make trips out to the parking lot with the girls that sit there with you." 

 "So you think I'm safe; is that it?" 

 "Can we just say that dancing with you will not get me a sullied reputation?" 

 I walked her back to her booth and she asked me to join her and Susan. I went back to my table and got my beer and then went back and joined them in their booth. I spent the next hour talking with the two of them and taking turns dancing with them. Then Susan looked at her watch and told Marge that it was time to go. I stood up, thanked them for their company, but before I could walk away Marge asked me if I would like to join them for coffee at the Town and Country and I told them I would like that. 

 "Do us a favor then and leave first. We will meet you at the Town and Country in about ten minutes." 

 She saw the look on my face and knew what I was thinking. 

 "It's that reputation thing again. We don't want it to look like we are leaving with anyone." 

 I got to the restaurant and took the only booth that was empty and maybe fifteen minutes later Marge and Susan walked in and joined me. I had pie and coffee and the girls just had coffee. As soon as the waitress had taken their order and had gone Susan turned to Marge and asked: 

 "What do you think?" 

 "I'm fine with it if you are." 

 "I am. Go ahead and ask him." 

 "Me? It is your idea; you ask him." 

 Susan turned to me and asked, "Do you have any sexual fantasies?" 

 "Doesn't everybody?" 

 "Have you ever had a fantasy about having a threesome with two women?" 

 "Hasn't every man?" 

 "Would you like to follow us to my place?" 

 "This is a joke, right? Someone put you up to this?" 

 "No joke honey. It is something that we have always wanted to try and tonight we decided to go for it." 

 "But why me?" 

 "Because you are a guy who won't talk about it. We want to do it, but we don't want it to get around. We know about you and Leslie, but you have never said a word about it to anyone so we feel we can trust you. How about it? Are you game?" 

 "I'd have to be a complete idiot to say no." 

 "Good. Let's finish our coffee and then you can follow us." 

 As I followed along behind them I wondered how they knew about Leslie and me. I know that I'd never told another living soul about us so it must have been Leslie who told them, but why would she do that? What was the tie between them? I wasn't going to ask and maybe queer the deal, but I was curious. 

 They pulled up in front of a large Colonial just outside the city limits and Marge got out of the car and came over to me and asked me to pull my truck around the corner and park. 

 "Susan has some very nosey neighbors and we don't want them to see a strange truck in the drive and give them something to talk about." 

 I parked around the corner and walked back to the house where Susan was standing at the door waiting for me. She shut the door behind me and giggled as she said: 

 "Marge is already in the bedroom getting naked. She can't wait to get started. Come on." 

 I followed Susan up the stairs and down the hallway to a bedroom and when we walked in Marge was already naked and lying on the bed with her legs spread wide. Susan laughed and said: 

 "I told you the greedy little slut was in a hurry." 

 She started undressing so I quickly got out of my clothes and joined the two of them on the bed. 

 "We have never done anything like this before" Marge said, "So what do we do?" 

 "Don't ask me. I've never done it before either." 

 "I can only see a couple of ways" Susan said, "He can eat one of us while the other sucks his cock and the one being eaten can suck on the tits of the cocksucker. Or he can fuck one of us doggie while the one being fucked munches on the pussy of the one not being fucked." 

 "Maybe one of us rides him cowgirl while the other sits on his face and the two of us play with each other's tits." 

 "Or he can lie on his back and one of us can suck his cock while the other sits on his face" Marge said and then she asked me, "What do you think?" 

 "Anyone of them sounds good to me." 

 "I like the last one" Susan said. 

 "Okay" Marge said, "And after a while we can switch." 

 I laid down on my back and said "Okay ladies, let's do it." 

 Marge said, "It was your idea and it's your house so you choose." 

 "I want his cock" Susan said and she moved down the bed and took my cock in her hand and licked it a couple of times and then she took me in her mouth. Marge swung over me and lowered her pussy to my face. I found out quickly that Marge's clit was super sensitive and in only minutes I gave her an orgasm. Susan's work on my cock was marvelous and she was making me feel pretty damned good. Marge got off my face and told Susan that it was her turn to taste my cock and Susan moved and lowered her pussy to my mouth. Marge took my cock in her hot mouth and I started munching on Susan's Taco. Marge was an excellent cocksucker and she had me pretty close to coming when she pulled her mouth of off me and said: 

 "What's that?" 

 "What's what?" Susan asked. 

 "That noise." 

 Susan lifted her head and listened and then her face turned pale and she jumped off me saying: 

 "Oh shit! That's the garage door opener. Gary's home." 

 "Who is Gary?" 

 "My fucking husband. He isn't supposed to be home until tomorrow night." 

 "Husband? I didn't see any rings." 

 "Oh fuck! Hand me my purse Marge." 

 While Marge was getting her purse Susan told me to grab my clothes and get under the bed. 

 "You're shitting me!" 

 "Not unless you want to jump out of a second floor window. You can't get in the closet because that is the first place he will go to hang up his suit coat." 

 She fished her rings out of her purse and was putting them on and I saw Marge getting dressed. 

 "What about her?" 

 "She can be here. You can't! For God's sake get under the fucking bed! He will take a shower before he comes to bed. When you hear the shower running get the hell out of here." 

 I heard a man holler out, "Honey, I'm home" and I grabbed my stuff and wiggled under the bed. I'd no sooner gotten there when Gary walked into the room. He saw Marge getting dressed and said: 

 "What's going on?" 

 "Marge was going to spend the night with me, but when we heard you come in she decided not to." 

 "What's the matter Maggie? We too noisy for you?" 

 "Something like that. I remember how long it took me to fall asleep the last time I slept over. Or the embarrassment I felt looking at you two the next morning. Call you tomorrow Suze" and Marge walked out of the room. 

 I know that under the circumstances my dick should have wilted, but Marge had me seconds from getting my rocks off and I was still hard. 

 "You out running around with her tonight?" Gary asked. 

 "We had dinner and a few drinks before we came home." 

 "You sure that you weren't out on 'the pull' as our English cousins would say?" 

 "Oh come on Gary. In the first place I would never do anything like that and in the second place no guy is going to give me a second look after he sees my rings." 

 "I can't help but worry when you go out with that slut. You might not be looking, but I'll bet she is and she could put you in a situation where bad things might happen." 

 "She is not a slut." 

 "Any woman divorced three times over cheating is a slut in my book." 

 "She never cheated Gary. It was her husbands that did the running around." 

 "So she says." 

 "I don't pick your friends Gary so I'll thank you not to try and pick mine." 

 "How did we get on this? I'm home, I'm horny and you are naked. Let me hang up my jacket and maybe we can rattle the bed springs for a while." 

 I heard him walk over and open the closet door and then walk back to the bed. I could see his feet from where I was and I saw his trousers drop down around his ankles. 

 "Aren't you going to take a shower first?" 

 "Not tonight my love. I'm super horny and seeing you naked on the bed and ready has me going." 

 All I could do was hope that he was one of those two minute kind of guys so he could get done and get into the shower and give me my chance to get out of Dodge. Not my lucky night. First he had to go down on her and in heard her squeal as she had an orgasm. Then he made love to her for a good ten minutes before cumming and then he said: 

 "I want more baby doll. Work your magic." 

 I heard the sounds of a sloppy blow job and then he was off to the races for another fifteen minutes or so. 

 "I'm going to take a quick shower and we can cuddle up. I've missed the snuggling and cuddling." 

 "I'll join you and do your back" Susan said and I hoped that was her way of telling me that she would keep him in the shower long enough for me to get clear. I heard the shower start running and I gave it a couple of minutes in case he forgot something and came back into the room and then I slid out from under the bed and hurried downstairs. I quickly dressed and got out of the house. 

 When I got to my truck I found Marge sitting in it. 

 "What took you so long?" 

 "Hubby was horny." 

 "Oh my God! You mean they did it right on top of you?" 

 "That they did." 

 "Oh you poor baby. You had to go through that after I left you hanging? I'll try to make it up to you." 

 "Why are you here? I mean why are you in my truck?" 

 "I need a ride home. Susan drove tonight and she swung by my place and picked me up and while you might be a little pissed right now I'm hoping that you aren't so pissed that you will make me walk eleven miles in these heels." 

 I started the truck and she gave me directions and as I pulled away from the curb I asked: 

 "So. Do you girls do this often?" 

 "God no. Tonight was the first time. We have talked about it for months, but tonight was the first time." 

 "Again I have to ask an earlier question -- why me?" 

 "Luck of the draw. Like I said, we have talked about it for months and with Gary out of town on business we decided this would be the night to go for it. We hadn't intended it to be anyone from Riley's. We just stopped in to get some liquid courage before going to a lounge on the other side of town. When we saw you we decided that you would be perfect for what we wanted. We needed someone who wouldn't talk about it and Susan knew from Leslie that you didn't talk about what you did so here we are."  

 

 

===

"I expected Leslie to be my female counterpart and keep quiet about what we did." 

 "Leslie and Susan are cousins -- very close cousins. Closer than some sisters. I don't think they have any secrets from each other." 

 There were several minutes of silence and then Marge said, "I'm sorry that it didn't work out. I'd say that we will do better the next time, but I don't think there will be a next time." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Susan really wanted to do it, but she wanted to do it with Gary." 

 "Why didn't you?" 

 "Gary doesn't like me and Susan knew if he would go ballistic if she suggested that the three of us got together." 

 "Well, just so you know, there won't be a next time even if she is willing, at least not with me. She is married and I don't mess with another man's woman. Tonight would never have happened if I'd known Susan was married. Did you know that her hubby thinks you are a slut? He doesn't like it that you and Susan go out together. He thinks that you are out looking for men and that you will drag Susan into a situation where she will end up taking on some guy. I don't think he suspects that she is already doing what he is afraid you will lead her into." 

 "She isn't doing it. She has been married to Gary for twelve years now and she has only cheated on him twice and one of those times couldn't really be called cheating. She was at a party and someone slipped her a date rape drug so that can't be counted as cheating." 

 "What about the other?" 

 "Some poor judgment on her part. It was another party. Gary was out of town and a black guy hit on her. She had always wondered if what was said about blacks was true and she'd had just enough to drink to let curiosity get the better of her. She was disappointed. He wasn't even as big as Gary. Both of those events were over ten years ago and she hasn't even come close to cheating on him since." 

 She was silent for a bit and then said, "No, that isn't true. She has cheated on him their entire marriage. With me. She doesn't consider that cheating because I'm not a man." 

 "Are you a lesbian? Is that why you have been divorced three times? Because you aren't really into men?" 

 "You can ask that after the blow job I gave you? No honey, I am not a lesbian, but I am bi-sexual. I go both ways. My three divorces all came about because I caught the assholes cheating. I know that sounds hypocritical considering that I just admitted to a long time affair with Susan, but there are differences. Harv got his secretary pregnant, Sam ran off with a stripper and Joe belonged to the slut of the month club. Besides, I don't consider girl to girl cheating. I got something that I could never get from my husbands and I never shorted them one little bit." 

 "Still, Susan was going to cheat tonight." 

 "I guess Gary was right in thinking I might lead Susan astray. I'm the one who talked her into trying it. She didn't really want to, but I guess I pressured her into it. I even led her to believe I'd hook up with another girl to make it happen. It wasn't nice of me and I know it, but I really, really wanted to experience it one time and she went along because she was afraid that if I did it with someone else I would stay with that someone else." 

 I didn't say anything and after several moments of silence she said, "I don't expect you to understand, but you can love more than one person at a time and that love can be different. Susan loves Gary, but she also loves me and....oh well, never mind." 

 "So you used her love for you to get her to agree to the girl girl guy thing?" 

 "She wanted to do it. She was not against the idea, but she wanted it to be with Gary and I knew Gary would never go for it with me involved." 

 I didn't say anything and after a couple of minutes she pointed at a driveway and said: 

 "Turn in here." 

 I pulled into the drive and stopped. I sat there with the truck running and waited for her to get out. She reached over and turned off the ignition and said "Come on" and started to get out. When I didn't move she said: 

 "Your choice. In the house where it is comfortable or here in the cramped truck, but I got something started tonight and I will finish it." 

 "That isn't necessary." 

 "It is to me. I had you seconds away from getting your rocks off and my pride will not let me send you home with a case of blue balls. I'm responsible for putting you where you were tonight and I have to make it right. So here or in the house?" 

 "I don't thi..." 

 "I'm not getting out of this truck without you so you either come into my house or I stay in the truck and end up going with you to yours." 

 I had never been with a woman so determined to get my pants off of me and I had been right on the verge of coming when everything went to hell. Add to that Marge was one very sexy looking lady so I decided not to fight it. 

 I followed her into the house and as soon as the front door closed behind us Marge asked: 

 "Would you like a drink?" 

 I didn't but I said, "Whatever you will be having is fine." 

 "That would be interesting to see." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "I'm having you so what that means is that it might be interesting to see you have yourself. Come on baby and let me show you my bedroom" and she took me by the hand and led me after her. 

 The first time was pretty quick. I mean I was seconds away when I had to slide under that damned bed and what was happening right over me was hot as hell and when we got to Marge's place I was ready to be Mount Vesuvius. Marge didn't even think twice about going down on me and working me back up and I'm pleased to be able to say I held my own the second time. As I pulled out of her she asked: 

 "Have you got one more in you?" 

 "With some help." 

 She gave me the necessary help and when I came for the third time I was whipped. 

 I woke up with Marge wrapped around me and I needed to pee so I tried to carefully separate myself from her without waking her up, but I wasn't successful. She woke up and her hand slid down my belly to my cock and as she took hold of my piss hard on she said: 

 "Good morning sunshine. Is this for me?" 

 "I have to pee." 

 "Do it and hurry back. Try not to piss all the hardness away." 

 When I came back to the bed she mounted me and rode me cowgirl until we both came and then she rolled off of me and said: 

 "Come along sailor and I'll scrub your back." 

 Her scrubbing my back led to her doing a few things to my front and we ended back in bed. That was followed by a second shower and as I started to get dressed Marge offered me breakfast, but my watch told me that I needed to hurry or I was going to be late for work so I said: 

 "Maybe some other time." 

 "I'm going to hold you to that." 

 As I drove to work I wondered if I'd found my replacement for Betsy. 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

It was three days before I saw Marge again. It was a Friday night and I was out on the dance floor with Betsy when Marge and Susan came in. They sat down in a booth and as soon as the song ended I walked Betsy back to the table and then headed for the booth where Marge and Susan were sitting. 

 As I walked up Marge slid over and patted the spot next to her. I slid in next to her and looked over at Susan. I already knew from what Marge had told me that as far as Susan was concerned our threesome wasn't likely to happen, but I wanted to get a dig in. I was just a little pissed that Susan had hidden from me the fact that she was married. If she and Leslie were as tight as Marge had led me to believe then Susan would have known how I felt about that. So I said: 

 "Ready for it tonight? I've been looking forward to this since Tuesday night." 

 Susan looked away and Marge jabbed an elbow into my side and when I looked at her she nodded her head "no." I shrugged and asked Marge to dance. As we moved onto the dance floor I said: 

 "I guess the elbow in the ribs means that the three of us aren't going to have any fun together?" 

 "I was lucky I could even talk her into stopping in tonight. She is really feeling guilty over the fact that she was going to cheat on Gary." 

 "I guess I need to make nice to her." 

 "It might help if you could find some way to make her think you don't consider her a slut." 

 "But I like sluts." 

 "That's why I'm available for you sweetie. I'm all the slut you need." 

 "Tonight?" 

 "You know where I live. No need to knock." 

 I did two numbers with Marge and then walked her back to the booth. When Jane came by I ordered a round for the three of us and after it had arrived and we'd all had a sip I offered my hand to Susan. 

 "Come on sweetie, your turn." 

 She was reluctant, but she followed me out onto the floor. She was a little stiff in my arms and I said: 

 "Relax sweetie, we're cool. Marge explained it to me. I know about your relationship and I know how our little farce on Tuesday came about. I'm just sorry it didn't work out. You are one hell of a sexy lady and as much as I wish otherwise I understand that it isn't going to happen and I'll never bring it up again." 

 She had been relaxing as I talked, but she stiffened up again when I said: 

 "But there is a price." I chuckled and said, "You have to let me buy you drinks and dance with me every time you come in. Can you handle that?" 

 She relaxed and said, "I can do that." 

 "Good. Now I don't want you to tense up on me again, but I want to bring the threesome idea up again. Why don't you ask Gary about it?" 

 "He would go nuts." 

 "You don't know that. You just think that because of the way he feels about Marge. Approach him and go at it from the angle that you want him to be on better terms with your best friend. The worst that can happen is that he will say no and even then you will have planted the thought and it may flower later. Just make sure that he understands that you are only interested in girl boy girl and not you and two guys and you should be fine even if he opts not to do it." 

 "You think?" 

 "Hey sweetie, if he says no you haven't lost a thing and he just might surprise you." 

 I kept here on the floor for three numbers and then walked her back to her seat and said: 

 "Thank you for the dances ladies. Maybe we can do it again." 

 I went back to the tables and the first thing I was asked was did I think there was any chance of getting either one of them out to the parking lot. 

 "Not a prayer. They both made it plain that a dance or two is all they would ever get off of." 

 "Then why don't they just come over and join us" Bill asked. 

 "Yeah" George piped in, "They stuck up or something?" 

 "You want the truth or do you want me to sugar coat it?" 

 "Let it out bud." 

 "Because of all the trips you guys make out to the parking lot with the girls who do sit here the girls who sit here are looked on as "easy sluts" and Marge and Susan won't sit here because people may think that they are the same way. They don't want to be "tarred with the same brush" so to speak." 

 "Well fuck 'em then" Vern said. 

 "You ain't kidding no one Ace. You spend more time with those two than any of the other girls. You've got to be hustling them." 

 "Not so. I dance more with them than the others because the others make me uncomfortable." 

 "How's that?" 

 "You guys know that I don't the parking lot shit. There seems to be an unofficial contest among the girls who do sit at this table to see who can be the one to get me to go. They rub up against me, rub my dick, say suggestive things to me and in general make me feel uncomfortable." 

 "Poor picked on baby" Phil said and they all laughed. 

 A half hour later Marge and Susan left and I gave them another twenty minutes and then I got up, said my "goodnights" and headed for Marge's place. I didn't knock and when I walked in I found her waiting for me wearing only high heels and a smile. By the time she was done with me I was too tired to drag myself out of bed and drive home. Luckily, Marge let me stay. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 For the next three weeks I danced with Marge and Susan every time they stopped in and then stopped by Marge's after they left. Plus I dated Marge on the weekends. Then came the Monday when Marge said to me: 

 "You will never guess what happened this weekend." 

 "Not without at least a clue." 

 "It was something that almost happened." 

 "Obviously I'm not going to get it so go ahead and tell me." 

 "Susan called me and asked me to stop by yesterday afternoon." 

 "So what? She's your best friend and you are always going over to her place to see her or she is going to your place." 

 "Gary was there." 

 "Again, so what?" 

 "Gary said yes to a threesome! It was awesome. I don't think he hates me anymore. I just wish it could have been you instead of Gary." 

 "I'll second that wish." 

 "He wants to do it again. Is that okay with you?" 

 "Why would it need to be okay with me?" 

 "We are seeing each other and you might not be all that eager to share me with another man." 

 "Sweetie, we just date. You are free to do what you please." 

 She got a look on her face that told me that I had just said something wrong so I quickly tried to cover my ass. 

 "What I mean baby is that you did it yesterday without calling me for permission so why ask me now? You wanted to do it and you did it and you say it was awesome. Do you really think that after you telling me that that I'm going to stand in your way? I would just hope that you set it up so that you do it on nights when I'm not around. I don't mind sharing in this special case, but I don't want to give up my quality time either." 

 "You mean that? It really is okay with you?" 

 "Of course it is." 

 "I guess I'll have to be especially nice to you tonight then." 

 She was. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Things got a little more confusing for me around the middle of the week. Jane, the girl hired to take Tina's place when Tina moved behind the bar, had to quit. Her husband came in one evening and saw the way most of the guys looked at and acted toward his honey and he decided that even though she was a good girl she didn't need to be in a place where a good girl with good intentions had ample opportunity to go bad. 

 Her replacement was Candy, the hot little redhead I'd met the night I was Vern's wingman. For some reason known only to God and Candy she semi attached herself to me. Maybe it was because I was the only one in the place that she already knew, but whatever the reason whenever I was there Candy took extra pains to make sure that I was taken care of. When things were slow she sat with me or stood next to me if I was sitting at the bar. The guys noticed and started ribbing me about my 'stalker' and all I could do was shrug. The night we had met she had put me on notice that she had a fiancé and was off limits so I minded my manners and treated her as just another girl that I knew and liked. 

 About the same time Freda, the German girl who ran the kitchen, started casting nasty glances at me and I wondered what was up with that. While Candy was hanging close and Freda was making faces at me I was rolling along as I always had. I'd come in after work, join the guys at the tables and dance with the girls who sat with us while I nursed my PBR. I had early on realized that I could easily become an alcoholic if I stopped in every night and pounded down the beers so I limited myself to no more than three a night and on most nights I actually held it to two. 

 I was seeing Marge about two nights a week and usually took her out on a date on at least one of the weekend days. I was still sending money to my grandmother in Florida for her to send back to Elaine and she was still getting letters from Elaine's attorney which I told her to toss without opening. Work was going fine, my love life was great and I was fairly content. 

 As everyone knows it is when you are thinking that all is right with your world that things tend to get FUBARED (that's military slang for "fucked up beyond all recognition'). It started one night at Riley's when Marge told me that Susan wanted to talk to me. 

 "Fine. Where is she?" 

 "It needs to be private. Can you stop by my place around noon on Saturday?" 

 "I suppose. What is it about?" 

 "I'd rather let Susan tell you." 

 "Give me a hint." 

 "I can't. All I can say is that it is an interesting development." 

 And indeed it was. 

 Saturday I joined Marge and Susan at Marge's kitchen table and Marge put a cold PBR on the table in front of me. And then Susan said: 

 "Marge has told you about our threesomes with Gary?" 

 "She mentioned that you were having them, but I didn't press for any details." 

 "Well, Gary likes them. He likes them so much that he wants to try a threesome with another man." 

 "You mean..." 

 "Yes. He wants another man to join him and me." 

 "That's what he wants. What do you want?" 

 "I don't know. Part of me of me wants to do it and part of me is scared about how it might turn out." 

 "What has you scared?" 

 "That I might like it too much." 

 "Why does that scare you?" 

 "If I like it too much I'll want to keep doing it." 

 "What's scary about that?" 

 "What if Gary doesn't like it after he tries it and I do. He will want to stop and I won't and I know me well enough to know that if I really like it I'm going to keep wanting to do it with or without Gary. Sooner or later I will talk myself into doing it and that is what scares me. I love Gary and I know what will happen if I get caught doing it without him." 

 "I guess you will just have to hope that Gary likes it. Your only other option is not to do it at all so that he never finds out that he doesn't like it and you don't find out that you really do." 

 "That isn't really an option. Gary wants to do it and he is pushing for it to happen." 

 "Well I guess that's that. Good luck." 

 "I want you to be the other man." 

 That sure enough surprised me. "I'm sorry sweetie, but I don't think I can help you there." 

 "Why not? You were willing enough when Marge and I took you home with us that night." 

 "I make it a habit to stay away from married women." 

 "You didn't have a problem that first time." 

 "I didn't know you were married either. If you will remember you were not wearing your rings that night. You had them in your purse. The other thing is that I'm not even sure that I could perform with another man in the room." 

 "The 'married thing' shouldn't matter because you won't be cheating with me. It can't be cheating if my husband is there and is a part of it. As far as performance is concerned I'm sure that you will manage. You seemed to like what you saw that first time." 

 "I'm not as confident of that as you are." 

 "Please Rob, I need you to do this for me." 

 "Why me Susan? The must be a hundred guys you know who would love to join you." 

 "I need you for the same reason Marge and I picked you the last time. I need someone I know and can trust not to blab about it. I also need someone I know that I feel comfortable with. It can't be anyone else that Gary and I know because if it doesn't work out I don't want to have to face them day to day. Please Rob, I need you for this." 

 I looked at Marge and she said, "Don't look at me sweetie; you are on your own on this." 

 Susan was still the sexy lady and turn on she had been on the night that she, Marge and I had gotten together and I should have been jumping at the chance she was offering me, but I was hesitant. Maybe if the second man was someone I knew I would have been more willing to take the leap, but to do what Susan wanted with someone who was a total stranger to me was a problem. I honestly did not know if I would be able to get it up and perform. And the fact that it was the stranger's wife we would be doing it with also caused me pause. Could he really handle it? Could I handle him if he couldn't?" 

 "Please Rob, help me out here." 

 I looked at her for several seconds and then thought, "What the hell. I'd never done a MMF before (and only one aborted MFF) so I decided to go for it. If it didn't work out I didn't socialize with Gary so we wouldn't likely see each other again. 

 "Okay Suze. I'll do it. When?" 

 "Some time in the next two weeks. Gary has to go out of town, but I'm not sure of the dates. Let me check out his calendar and I'll get back to you." 

 She leaned across the table and kissed me and then she got up and told Marge that she would talk to her later and she left. Once she was gone I said to Marge: 

 "Okay lover, give me your thoughts on this." 

 "I'm thinking that if it works out the four of us can get together and play. If that happens it will give me the chance to do the MFF thing with you and Susan." 

 "Now that's a thought." 

 "I think we should go to the bedroom and practice. What do you think about that?" 

 "It sounds like a damned fine idea." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I had a doctor's appointment so I took the afternoon off from work. Appointment out of the way I headed for Riley's. It was early and none of the businesses had let out yet so I had the place pretty much alone. I pushed our usual tables together and then sat down to nurse my Pabst Blue Ribbon. 

 Several minutes after I sat down Freda walked over and sat down across from me. Her English had gotten a little better and I was able to understand her. 

 "Hey! Are you sissy boy?" 

 "Am I what?" 

 "A sissy boy. How you say it -- a queek?" 

 "A queek?" 

 "Yes. You smoke a log no?" 

 Then it hit me what she was saying and I said, "No Freda, I am not a homosexual." 

 "Why you no like me then? Why you no watch me like other mens?" 

 What do you say to something like that? Freda certainly was a walking wet dream and the only reasons I hadn't done anything were because of seeing her shoot every one else down and of not wanting to fight the language barrier, but how do you tell a girl that you haven't had anything to do with her because she couldn't speak decent English? I decided to take the easy way out. 

 "I have stayed away from you Freda because I've seen how you treated the other men who have come after you. I decided that you weren't interested in the men who come in here and so I've stayed away from you." 

 "Of course I do nothing with those foolish mens. All the time with whores in the parking lot. Why I have anything to do with them? You no do this, but you no come to me so I think you sissy boy." 

 "Well I'm not a sissy boy Freda." 

 "You prove this to me." 

 "How do I do that?" 

 "We go date together." 

 "And when do we do this?" 

 "I off on 23rd. We do then." 

 I looked at the calendar behind the bar and saw that the 23rd was a Friday. There was still the language barrier that I really didn't want to fight, but on the other hand I had a stone fox after me to take her out. Maybe the 'language of love' would work in my favor. 

 "Okay Freda, the 23rd it is." 

 "Is good" she said and she got up and went back into the kitchen. 

 Freda was no sooner out of sight when Candy came over. "I heard most of that. You aren't really going to go out with that slut are you?" 

 "I've never seen her with a man so how did she all of a sudden become a slut?" 

 "I know a bit about her and trust me on this Rob, she isn't any good. You need to steer clear of her." 

 "You have to give me more than that." 

 "I was in the pantry filling salt and pepper shakers and she was talking with a woman who had stopped by to pick up some money that Freda owed her. The woman asked Freda how she was coming along with her plan. From what I overheard it seems like Freda is looking for an American to marry so she can legally stay in this country. The plan is to marry him, get citizenship and then take the man for all he has and then leave him. Looks like she figures that you could be her sucker." 

 "You are making all this up right? Trying to scare me away from Freda so you will have a clear field?" 

 "Why would I want a clear field?" 

 "You lust for me and you want me and you feel you must save me from the clutches of the evil Freda." 

 "Yeah, right" she said and then walked away. 

 The crew started coming in about that time, money was put in the jukebox and I started dancing with a couple of the girls and forgot about Freda and what Candy had told had told me. Until it was time for me to leave. Candy caught me as I was heading for the door. 

 "I've decided to save you from yourself providing of course that you want to be saved." 

 "How are you going to do that?" 

 "Simple. On the 23rd you will take me out instead of Freda. She will be so pissed at you for standing her up that she will never speak to you again." 

 "You know what you are letting yourself in for? There is only one way to prove to Freda that I'm not a homosexual. Freda is a sure thing. Why would I give that up just to have dinner with you?" 

 "I'll make sure that you don't suffer." 

 "What will your fiancé think about that?" 

 "He is history." 

 "What happened?" 

 "We got in an argument about religion. He thought he was God and I didn't. Think about my offer" she said and then she got back to work. 

 I did think about it as I drove over to Marge's place. I'd heard about how some women married Americans just so they could stay in the United States and I even knew a guy who had married a German girl when he was in the Army and stationed in Germany. She left him just over a year after he brought her home with him. I didn't know whether she was still here or had been sent back to Germany. Was Freda a girl like that? I didn't know, but we were only talking 'date' here and not marriage. 

 What all the thinking boiled down to was which one would I rather have? Both Candy and Freda were walking wet dreams and which ever one I went with would almost certainly mean I'd never have a shot at the other. I needed to decide which one I'd rather have and being the cock hound I'd turned into since separating from Elaine "having" meant picking out the best chance to get laid and to continue getting laid. Talk about your no win situation. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The rest of the week slid by and I spent the night with Marge on Tuesday and Thursday and we went out for dinner and a show on Saturday. The show was followed by Marge spending the night and most of the next day at my apartment. Monday Marge and Susan came into the bar about an hour after I got there. I was dancing with one of the girls from our table when they came in and Susan nodded at me and then gave me s slight nod toward the booth they were headed for. When the song was over I walked Nancy back to the table and then hit the men's room. On the way back I stopped and asked Marge if she wanted to dance. 

 "Maybe later. Right now you need to dance with Suze." 

 I offered Susan my arm and we moved out onto the dance floor. The juke box was playing a slow tune and as we swayed across the floor Susan said:  

 

 

===

"Gary is out of town right now, but he is supposed to be back on Thursday. He really, really wants to do the two guy one girl thing. It is set for Friday. Make sure that you load up with vitamins lover; I plan on reducing both of you to quivering wrecks." 

 "This Friday? The 23rd?" 

 "Yes. Its okay isn't it?" 

 "Yeah, sure. I just didn't think it would happen this soon." 

 I danced twice with Susan and three times with Marge and Marge asked me if I was up to follow her home. I told her that I had offered Bill a ride home, but I would stop by her place as soon as I had dropped him off. 

 "The door will be open lover, and you know the way to the bedroom." 

 When I walked into the bedroom I found Marge on the bed with her legs spread wide and working a dildo in and out of her pussy. 

 "Thinking about what you are going to be doing Friday has me so damned hot that I couldn't wait for you." She tossed the dildo to the floor and said, "Hurry lover, give me the real thing." 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 As I drove home my mind was wrestling with the problem. Freda was expecting to go out with me on the Friday and I knew what would happen with her. There was only one way to prove that I wasn't gay and that was to fuck her and she knew it. Candy was sure that she had warned me off from Freda and was expecting me to say yes to her offer to 'save me' and whether or not that 'saving' would include sex was not clear. Susan was expecting me to join with her and her husband for fun and games. All three of them were expecting whatever it was they were expecting on Friday, the 23rd. To quote a very famous philosopher - - "Fuck me!" 

 The thought process over the next two days went something like this. The thing with Freda wasn't going to go anywhere. She could be the most fantastic piece of ass I'd ever had, but it wasn't going anywhere long term. The thing with Susan and Gary wasn't going to go long term either. I had no idea if anything would happen with Candy, but would it go anywhere? It could because I had a soft spot for sexy redheads. So there I was, wanting to dip my wick in all three of them and knowing that whichever one I chose would make the other two history. 

 And then I got to thinking about Marge. Marge wasn't long term either. Not really, really long term anyway. We had already discussed where our relationship might go and Marge was quite up front that she had no intention of getting married again for many, many years, but she had also led me to believe that I could be her bed buddy for as long as I was interested. But Marge was Susan's best friend and had been for many, many moons and how would she take it if I turned my back on Susan and went with either Freda or Candy? Would I still be welcome? 

 All of that was rolling around in my head for two days and I still hadn't decided what to do when the shop loudspeaker squawked: 

 "Rob McKeean please report to the front office." 

 I shut off my Miller 251, put my welding helmet on the work bench and headed for the office. I went over to Cheri, the receptionist, and said: 

 "You rang?" 

 She pointed to the boss's office and I walked in and found two cops standing there. "Rob McKeean?" one of them asked and I nodded my head yes. 

 "We have a warrant for your arrest on a charge of failure to appear." 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

I almost smiled as the cell door clanged shut behind me. The decision on how to handle my Friday the 23rd problem had been taken out of my hands by some judge. I would be a guest of the county on Friday. In fact, being me it was almost certain that I would be a guest of the county for a while. 

 The "failure to appear" had to be over the divorce and the papers I had thrown in the trash and I already knew that I was going to do the same thing that I had done the last time. I would keep getting hit with contempt of court until they finally got tired of me freeloading off of them. Since it was a Thursday the soonest all parties could be notified and then gathered together was Monday so I made myself comfortable and waited. 

 When I was led into court on Monday I saw my brother sitting in the first row and then I got a surprise. Elaine was sitting at a table with a man I presumed was her lawyer. The man turned to look at me as I walked in and I got a good look at his face. I knew it from somewhere. I couldn't place it, but I knew it. 

 

 The judge came in and things got started. I was there because I had failed to meet my obligations per the court orders issued at the time of the divorce and I had failed to respond to four notices to appear. I explained that I had never received any notices to appear. Elaine's lawyer was called to the bench and he and the judge talked for a bit and then the judge asked me when I had moved back from Florida. I told him that I had never lived in Florida and then I explained how word had reached me that Elaine was going to try and talk me into taking her back and how I had set things up so I wouldn't be bothered by her. The judge thought for a moment and then voided the failure to appear charges. 

 "The second item before this court is your failure to make the court ordered alimony payments to Ms. McKeean." 

 "I've been making payments to her on a monthly basis." 

 Then Elaine's lawyer stood up and said that while it was true that I had been making monthly payments they were not for the specified amount and for the first four months after the divorce was final I made no payments at all. I explained to the judge the agreement we had made over the kitchen table (he was a different judge from the one who had locked me up) and that even though Elaine had broken that agreement when she allowed her attorney to make changes I was still going to stick to the deal that I had made. He gave me the same 'that agreement has no weight in the law' that the first judge gave me. 

 "That may be your honor, but where I come from a deal is a deal and remains in effect unless both parties agree to change the deal. I agreed to no such changes so my deal with the former Mrs. McKeean stands until we both agree to make a change and I'll say right now that I won't agree to any change that puts me farther behind the eight ball. She never honored any of the agreement she made when we sat down and decided who would get what out of the divorce and as far as I am concerned I owe her no more than I agreed to pay." 

 "You are flirting dangerously close to a contempt citation Mr. McKeean." 

 "All I am doing your honor is stating my position as clearly as I can." 

 There was some more talk and in the end I was ordered to pay all arrearages within fifteen days and was warned if I didn't the next time I appeared before him I would get jail time for contempt. 

 As we were walking out the door of the courtroom Elaine's lawyer smiled at me and said: 

 "Wondering how we found you? You shouldn't have renewed your driver's license in this state." 

 The he laughed and walked out. He didn't know it but he had just fucked himself. When he smiled at me I remembered where I had seen him before. He was the asshole who had walked up to Elaine and put his hand on her shoulder the night she had locked me out of the house. 

 My brother met me in the hall outside the courtroom. He was surprised (and frankly so was I) that I hadn't been locked up, but he had been ready to go my bail as long as I wasn't put away for contempt. We went to lunch and I asked for his advice and a recommendation on the thoughts I was having about Elaine's lawyer and he said that he would checkout a few things and get back to me. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 After lunch I swung by Woodbine to see if I still had a job and my boss made me get right to work. I worked late and skipped going to Riley's and instead I went straight home and went to bed. 

 I had no idea what I would be walking into when I stopped at the bar Tuesday after work, but I'd had plenty of time to think things over while I sat in jail over the weekend. I would try and do them all if they all were still willing, but I would set the times so that what was going to happen on the 23rd wouldn't happen again. 

 All of that was iffy of course. Susan might have found someone else to take my part on the 23rd and Candy might not be interested if it wasn't going to 'save me' from Freda. I figured that Freda was still a sure bet since she had been the one to come after me, but I would have to wait and see. 

 I worked late Tuesday to make up some of the hours I lost by having to sit in a jail cell so I didn't get to Riley's until after eight. Susan and Marge were there and Candy saw me come in and said: 

 "Hey, it's the jailbird. They turned him loose." 

 I stuck my tongue out at her and headed for the group table. Candy brought me a beer and then I had to describe my weekend to everybody. I stayed with the group for about a half hour and then I moved over to the booth where Marge and Susan were sitting. 

 "Sorry about Friday night, but something came up." 

 "We heard" Marge said. 

 Then Susan said, "It wouldn't have been much fun anyway. Gary's deal had problems and he had to stay over an extra day and then there were flight delays and he was in a rotten mood when he got home. He still wants to do it and he has no trips scheduled for the next two weeks so pick a day." 

 "You pick one. I can make it at any time." 

 "Day after tomorrow?" 

 "You got it." 

 "Come on" Marge said, "Dance with me." 

 As we moved around the floor Marge asked, "Are you coming by tonight?" 

 "I don't know. Are you sure you want to have anything to do with a hardened criminal?" 

 "I think that I t is my duty as a Christian to help rehabilitate you and help you reenter society." 

 "Well I do have to say that I love the way you rehabilitate so I guess I will stop by." 

 I did and it was all I could do to make it into work the next morning. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Wednesday I was the first one to arrive at the bar and I stuck my head in the kitchen to see if Freda was there. She was and so I walked in and apologized for not taking her out on Friday. She shrugged and said: 

 "I hears that you were in the bars ya?" 

 "Yes, I was behind bars. I still want to take you out and show you that I'm no sissy boy. When is your next day off?" 

 "Friday." 

 "May I have it?" 

 "Ya." 

 "Dinner, a show and then maybe dancing, okay?" 

 "Ya. That godt." 

 When I came out of the kitchen I took a seat at the bar and Candy came over and stood next to me. 

 "Still sniffing after the kraut?" 

 "What you told me about her has my curiosity fired up. I want to see if you are right. If you are I want to see how far she is willing to go to play me. She doesn't have a chance, but she doesn't know that. 

 "Why do you say that? I don't like the bitch, but even I can tell she is a hot number." 

 "She isn't my type." 

 "And just what is your type?" 

 "About 5' 2'' and 100 pound with green eyes and red hair." 

 She gave me an appraising glance and then moved off to wait on customers. About that time a couple of the girls came in and started pushing tables together and I got up to help them. 

 About half an hour later Susan came in and for the first time ever she came over and sat at our tables. 

 "What's up? I asked. 

 "Marge had to go see her sister and I didn't want to sit alone. Dance with me?" 

 On the floor she asked, "We still ob for tomorrow night?" 

 "Wouldn't miss it." 

 "Can I ask you for a big favor?" 

 "I suppose." 

 "Can I follow you home tonight?" 

 "Why would you want to do that?" 

 "Gary was suddenly called out of town and won't be back until noon tomorrow. I want to talk to you about tomorrow night, but I want to do it in a quiet place." 

 "Okay. Have a drink or two and then leave and drive over to the library and wait for me in the parking lot." 

 She danced with Vern and Max and then one more time with me and then she left. I gave her ten minutes and then I got up to leave. I saw Leslie looking at me and smiling and then she winked at me. I remembered that she was Susan's cousin and Marge had said they were closer than some sisters and had no secrets from each other and I wondered what Susan had told her about tomorrow night. 

 Once inside my apartment I asked Susan if she would like something to drink and I told her I had beer and wine and she asked if it was white or red. I told her I had both so she asked for a glass of white. I got her a glass and she took a sip and then said: 

 "This awkward for me, but I need to do it. First I have a confession to make. I fibbed when I told you that Marge was visiting her sister. She knows I'm here and she is staying away to make it easier on me." 

 I looked at her and waited and then she said, "I want to make tomorrow great for Gary. To do that I want to do it all and all includes anal. Gary has never wanted anal and to be honest that has always been fine with me because Gary is so large and my butt hole is so small. I'm not trying to put you down, but I remember your size from our aborted night. You are maybe an inch longer than Gary, but he is bigger around than you." 

 "So what is it you are trying to say here?" 

 "I want you to open me up for my husband. I want you to do me in my butt tonight. A couple of times. And tomorrow I want you to do me in the butt again. I know when Gary sees you do it he will want to try and then I'm going to want one of you in my pussy and one of you in my butt at the same time." 

 "Are you sure about this?" 

 "I am. I don't know if Gary will ever want to do a threesome again after tomorrow so I want to make sure he gets it all tomorrow night. Please Rob?" 

 "I can't say no when you ask me like that Suze. As long as you are sure." 

 "I'm sure Rob. I need you to get me used to it before tomorrow. I know it will close up between tonight and tomorrow, but I'm sure that tomorrow it will be easier and that is what I need. At least I'll know what to expect and I can act accordingly. If I wait until tomorrow to try it for the first time and it hurts too much Gary will notice and it will turn him off. I don't want anything to ruin things for him. I want tomorrow night to be perfect for him." 

 "Okay sweetie, let's take it to the bedroom." 

 Susan stripped and got on the bed and I went into the bathroom and got the tube of KY Jelly out of the medicine cabinet. I undressed and got on the bed with her. I knelt beside her head and pushed her legs apart. I squeezed some KY on my fingers and then ran my fingers over her puckered butthole and then I slid a finger by her sphincter and started working it in and out of her butt. A little more KY and then I had two fingers in her. I felt her pull on my legs and she said: 

 "I need to get you ready too." 

 I swung over her in a sixty-nine and her mouth captured my cock while I worked a third finger into her. I worked the three fingers around in her for several minutes and then I pulled my cock out of Susan's mouth and told her to get up on her hands and knees. I filled my palm with KY and stroked myself making sure that every inch of my cock was covered and then I put my cockhead right up against Susan's asshole. 

 "Take a bite of pillow sweetie. It is going to hurt for just a bit when we start." 

 I applied gentle pressure against her anal opening and slowly pressed forward I felt a slight slip and then I was past the sphincter muscle and inside her. She moaned into the pillow as I slowly worked my way forward and back until my cock was all the way in to the base and my balls were slapping her ass. I reached under her and rubbed her clit and she moaned and I slowly started fucking her ass. After a minute or so I felt a slight movement as she pushed herself back at me so I began taking longer strokes. She moaned what sounded like "Oh yes" and shoved her ass back at me and I picked up steam. 

 "So full, so full, oh fuck me. Fuck my ass, fuck my ass." 

 She was now shoving back at me as I thrust into her and she was moaning and groaning and grunting and I couldn't make out all that she was saying, but the message was clear -- "Fuck my ass and make me cum." I was hitting her harder and harder and going faster and faster and she was crying, "Yesyesyesyesyes" and then she cried out "Oh Fuck" as an orgasm took hold of her and her muscles clamped down on my cock so hard that I could barely pull my cock back. I felt my balls tighten and I shoved back into her as hard as I could and I exploded into her ass. Her muscles milked me as I tried to withdraw and then I popped out and Susan fell forward on the bed and then rolled over and looked up at me. 

 "My God that was intense. How soon can you go again? 

 "I go wash it to get it clean and then how soon will be up to you. 

 We did it twice more and she seemed to enjoy it both times. 

 "Can I sleep here with you tonight? Gary thinks I'm spending the night with Marge." 

 I pulled her close and we snuggled up until we fell asleep. 

 I woke up thinking that I was having a wet dream, but it was Susan nursing on my cock. When I was awake (and as hard as an iron bar) Susan asked: 

 "One more time?" 

 I made it to work with two minutes to spare. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was a little nervous as I walked up to Susan's and Gary's front door. It was something I'd never done before. How do you handle a situation like that? If Susan answered the door all I needed to do was follow her lead. But what if Gary answered the knock? "Hi there. I'm Rob and I'm here to help you fuck your wife" might not be the way to go. 

 Susan was the one who answered my knock (Thank God) and she led me into the living room where her husband was sitting and watching television. He stood up as I walked into the room and Susan introduced us. We shook hands and Susan asked if I would like a beer or something stronger and I said beer would be fine and she left the room to get it and Gary asked: 

 "Are you as nervous about this as I am?" 

 "Damned near terrified." 

 "Can I ask why?" 

 "I've never done anything like this before." 

 "How did you get involved?" 

 "I have been keeping company with Marge for a while and I guess I was just in the right place at the right time." 

 Susan and I had discussed the matter and we decided to stick as close to the truth as we could without giving up the fact that she and I had been naked together before. 

 "She talked Marge into working on me to do it." 

 He looked at me for a second and I could tell he was trying to make up his mind about something and then he apparently decided to go for it. 

 "You know about Marge, Susan and me?" 

 "Yes. Marge asked me if I would be okay with it and I said yes. My saying yes is why I probably was asked to join you." 

 Susan and I had talked about it the night before and we agreed that Gary should run the show and that if he seemed unsure of anything to let Susan take the lead. She didn't want it to seem like I was running things in his house and with his wife. 

 She did give me a proposed game plan -- the way she wanted it to go. We would start out working her up by playing with her breasts and fingering her pussy and then she would give Gary head while I gave her head and then Gary and I would swap places. Next Gary would fuck her while she gave me head and when Gary came he and I would switch again and I would fuck her until I came while she sucked Gary hard again. As soon as I got off she would suck me hard again and then ask which of us would like to be the first in her ass. She expected Gary to say no, but she wanted to give him the first shot. If he passed she would suck him while I screwed her butt and if he still had no interest in her ass she would fuck him while I washed my cock and then she would suck me hard. As soon as I was hard she would say she wanted one of us in her pussy and one oRilf us in her ass and after that we would wing it. 

 Susan came back with my beer and after some small talk that had nothing to do with why we were there Susan said: 

 "I guess someone has to get the ball rolling so how about we take it to the bedroom." 

 She got up and Gary and I looked at each other and then we got up and followed along behind her. Once in the bedroom Susan pointed at the bed and told us to sit. Gary and I sat down on the bed and Susan walked over to the dresser where a portable radio/tape player sat and pushed a button. Gretchen Wilson's "You Don't Have to Go Home" started and Susan did a strip tease to the music. When she was down to thigh high nylons and high heels she swayed over to Gary, knelt in front of him, unzipped him and worked his cock out of his pants. She looked up at me, smiled and said: 

 "Get naked lover; you're next." 

 She took Gary's cock in her mouth and I stood up and stripped. As soon as I was naked I started playing with her tits and then I knelt down beside her and worked a finger into her pussy. She was wet! 

 I was tugging on and rolling her right nipple between my fingers when Gary reached down and started working on her left one. Susan moaned and pulled her mouth off Gary and told him to hurry up and strip. "On the bed lover" she said to me and once I was on my back she bent over and took my cock in her mouth. Gary got undressed and then moved in behind her and slid his cock into her hot box. She moaned and took my cock a little deeper into her mouth and throat and then it went pretty much as she had planned it when at my place the night before. 

 The big surprise was when she asked who wanted to be the first one in her ass and Gary surprised her and said he did. Susan looked at me and said: 

 "Gary and I have never done anal. Have you?" 

 "A time or two." 

 "What do we do?" 

 "Do you have any KY?" 

 "I bought some just for tonight." 

 She went over to the dresser and got a tube of KY Jelly and then I led Gary though the steps until he got to the point where he got three fingers working in her butt hole and then I told him to grease himself up good and then slowly work it into her giving her time to get used to it. 

 "Slow and easy is the key. Wait for her to tell you when to pick up the pace." 

 As Gary pushed his cock at Susan's asshole she looked at me and winked. Gary popped past the sphincter and Susan moaned. Gary started to pull back and Susan cried out: 

 "No! Don't stop, keep going." 

 After a couple of minutes he was in and slowly stroking and Susan was moaning: 

 "Yes, yes, oh God yes. So full, so full, fuck me Gary, fuck me." 

 Gary motioned me forward and I moved up and presented my cock to Susan's mouth and she opened up and took me in. Gary came and went into the bathroom to wash his cock and I moved from Susan's mouth to her ass. I was fucking her butt when Gary came back and put his cock in her mouth. I came and as I was heading for the bathroom to clean up Gary slid into her ass again and I heard: 

 "I love it baby and we are going to do a lot more of it okay?" 

 "Whatever you want my love." 

 When I came back with a clean cock I found the two of them sitting on the bed waiting for me. 

 "I'm ready for one of you in my pussy and one of you in my ass" Susan said, "Who wants what?" 

 I looked at Gary and he smiled and said, "You are the guest so you get to choose." 

  

 

 

===

Susan mouthed "pussy" at me and so I said I'd take the pussy. "This is another first for me" Susan said, "Do you know how to do it?" 

 "I've never done it before either" I said, "But I have seen it done on porn videos and I've only seen it done two ways. Cowgirl and reverse cowgirl." 

 "I want to try both." 

 I lay down on the bed and had her mount me 'cowgirl' style and then I pulled her down so she was lying on my chest and then told Gary to take her butt. As soon as he was in her I told him to start fucking her. All I had to do was lie there. As Gary pushed in Susan would move up on my cock and as he pulled back she would come back down. Basically it was Gary fucking her and her fucking me. After three or four minutes of 'cowgirl' Susan said she wanted to try the other way so Gary pulled out, Susan turned around and Gary got on his back. Susan sat down on his cock and I moved over her and pushed into her pussy. It only took about two minutes before Susan said: 

 "I don't like it this way. Let's go back to the other." 

 We switched positions again and fucked for another ten minutes until I came and then I got up. Gary pulled Susan up on her knees and plowed into her ass while she went to work at getting me up again. It took her a while, but by the time Gary had come I was ready again. As Gary headed for the bathroom to wash his cock I asked Susan where she wanted it. 

 "My ass lover, I want you deep in my ass." 

 Gary came back with a clean cock and Susan went to work to resurrect it. It took me a while, but I eventually came and pulled out and Susan rolled over on her back and told Gary to fuck her pussy. When I got back from washing off my cock I stood there and watched Susan and Gary go at it. When Gay was done Susan looked at me and asked: 

 "What can we do next?" 

 "I've no idea what the two of you can do, but I'm done. I don't think I could get it up again tonight to save my life." 

 "Bet you I can get it up." 

 I knew she didn't have a chance in hell. Three times the night before, once more that morning and then the night's activities? No way! But she tried for a good five minutes before she admitted defeat. Gary was ready again by then and he asked her where she wanted it. 

 "In my ass lover; I really do like it in my ass." 

 I watched them for a few minutes and then started dressing. Once dressed I bent down, took Susan's head in both hands and kissed her. Her tongue darted into my mouth and I gave her a little back and then stood up. 

 "Thank you both for a marvelous evening. I'll see myself out. Good night." 

 I walked out of the room to the sound of flesh smacking flesh and Susan moaning. 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

When I got back to my apartment there was a message on my answering machine to call my brother. I called him and he told me that what we had talked about at the courthouse was doable and I told him to go ahead and do it. Then I went to bed and slept like a log. 

 Friday was a busy day at work and even though I had my hands full trying to finish the job I was on by the end of the day I was still able to think about my evening with Susan and Gary and wonder if I would ever do something like that again. 

 I also gave some thought to my date with Freda that night after work. I wondered if Candy was right and if so how would Freda play things. Play hard to get to lead me on or straight to fucking my brains out to enslave me with hot sex? And of course there was the third possibility – none of the above. Candy could be wrong and it could turn out that Freda was simply curious over whether I was a 'sissy boy' or not. 

 I finished the job and then hurried home to shower and change. I put on my only suit and then headed out to pick up Freda. We had dinner at Harry's Steak House and then went to Cineplex 2 to see "Australia." Dinner was a little awkward because of the language problem, but we got through it and the movie went better because we didn't talk during it although I did wonder if she understood any of it. Half way through the picture Freda's left hand found its way to my right and we held hands for the rest of the show. 

 After the movie we headed for the Black Mushroom for drinks and dancing. As soon as we were in the car Freda slid over next to me and put her left hand on my leg. Not a word was said on the way to the Mushroom. I paid the cover and we found an empty table, ordered drinks and then Freda pulled me off my chair and led me out onto the dance floor. A slow number was being played and Freda moved in close and pressed her body into mine. That alone should have proved to her I was no 'sissy boy' since my cock was rock hard and pushing into her leg. 

 "Oh ho, my sissy boy like Freda" she said as she ground her leg into my erection. 

 "I think you know by now that I'm not a sissy boy. You are feeling the proof with your leg." 

 "Okay yes I feel, but you still my sissy boy." 

 We finished the dance and our drinks came. Freda picked up hers and chugged it down then she set the glass down on the table and said: 

 "Sissy boy take me home now" and she grabbed her purse and stood up. I didn't even get a chance to take one sip of my drink, but I didn't argue. I was just too curious. That I was "her sissy boy" intrigued me and I had to see where things were going. 

 When we got to the truck I went to open the door for her but she pushed my hand away from the doo handle and instead she reached for the handle to the back door. She pulled the back door open and said: 

 "Back seat sissy boy." 

 I guess I was a little too slow for her so she pushed me into the truck and I ended up on my back on the back seat. Freda's hands went to my zipper and she pulled it down and then worked my cock out of my pants and that was no easy thing because it was rock hard solid. She did get it out and as she stroked it she said: 

 "Nice deek for a sissy boy." 

 Her hands moved up and down on it for several seconds and then she bent and took me in her mouth. She sucked me for maybe a minute and then she mounted me. She had taken her panties off sometime during the night (if she even had any on when I picked her up) and she was so wet that I slid right in. 

 "Sissy boy like hot pussy?" 

 "Oh yeah" I said as I grabbed her hips and thrust up into her. Suddenly she 'yelped' and pulled herself off of me. Her cunt hairs had gotten caught in my zipper and when she rose up a few of them were pulled out. 

 "Come on sissy boy" she said as she pushed the door open, "We go your place." 

 I was no sooner out of the lot than she slid over next to me and took my cock out again. "Nice deek sissy by, I play with" and she slowly stroked it all the way to my apartment. 

 I led her into the bedroom and watched her strip as I undressed. As the last piece of her clothing hit the floor I realized I was in big trouble. She was a Teutonic goddess, a living, breathing Valkyrie. Tall, blond, blue eyed and stacked. I had serious doubts that I was going to be able to do her justice. Did I have enough left after the last two nights with Susan to give Freda all that her magnificence deserved? If I didn't would Freda start really thinking I was a sissy boy? 

 Freda lay back on the bed, spread her legs and then pulled her pussy lips apart with her hands. 

 "You like sissy boy? You want? Come sissy boy, show Freda you want." 

 I got on the bed and moved between her legs and she put her hands on my head and pushed me down. 

 "Eat sissy boy, eat." 

 I munched on her muffin for a couple of minutes and then she pushed my head away and said: 

 "Now sissy boy, in me. Put your sissy boy deek in me." 

 After that I was like a bronc rider trying to hang on and get my eight second ride. She bucked and screamed and it was all I could do to hang on. It was the absolute most furious fuck of my life. I don't know how many times she came before I finally got my release, but if all the hollering, yelling and screaming were any indication it was a bunch. 

 As I lay there next to Freda trying to catch my breath and recover she reached down and fondled my limp dick and said: 

 "Plenty good for sissy boy. We do again." 

 It was a statement and not a question and she slid down and took my cock in her mouth. It took her a bit, but she got me standing tall and then said: 

 "You hard sissy boy. We do" and she moved over me and lowered herself onto my cock. She rode me cowgirl for almost ten minutes and then I rolled her over onto her back and pounded her as hard as I could while she had several orgasms. I finally drove myself hard into her and came and then I rolled off of her onto my back beside her. I lay there huffing and puffing and afraid that I might even pass out if she wanted to go again. Freda tucked herself into me and said: 

 "I no done sissy boy. You rest and we do again." 

 I was so pooped that I fell asleep. I don't know how much later it was when I woke up with a mouth on my cock. Freda felt me move and she looked up at me, took her mouth off me and said: 

 "Soon sissy boy, soon. Freda get you ready." 

 She did get me ready even though it took her a while. She pulled me on top of her, wrapped her long legs around me, sank her nails in my ass and said: 

 "Hard sissy boy, hard." 

 When I came I am sure that nothing came out of the head of my cock but puffs of dust. I was praying that Freda was satisfied by then because I seriously doubted that I would be able to get hard again for days. Freda pulled me to her and said: 

 "We sleep now sissy boy." 

 I fell almost immediately to sleep. 

 The ringing of the phone woke me up and I looked at the bedside clock and saw that t was almost ten. Freda was still asleep beside me with her blond hair spread like a fan over her pillow. I reached across her and picked up the cordless phone. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Good morning stud. How are you doing?" 

 "Stud?" 

 "Susan has been telling me about your Thursday night for two days now. If half of what she says is true, then yes – stud!" 

 "Not hardly. Apparently she didn't tell you that I pooped out on her at the end." 

 "Pooped out?" 

 "I reached a point where I could no longer answer the call. She ended up having to settle for just Gary." 

 "Well stud, from her description of the night she does not feel short changed at all." 

 I was lying on my back with the phone at my ear and looking up at the ceiling when I felt a hand begin playing with my cock and I was surprised big time when it started to respond. I would have bet my next paycheck that there was no way in hell that I would be able to get it up again for days. 

 "The reason I'm calling lover is to find out if we can get together this afternoon?" 

 I felt the bed shift as Freda moved and then I felt a hot mouth take the place of the hand. 

 "I'm sorry Marge, but I'm going to my brother's this afternoon. It is my nephew's birthday and I expect that it will run late." 

 "Tomorrow then?" 

 "You bet." 

 By the time I had disconnected from Marge Freda had me standing tall and when I reached over to put the phone back in its base she pulled me on top of her. 

 "Fook me sissy boy, fook me hard." 

 When I dropped her off at her place she said, "I Wednesday off again. I see you okay sissy boy?" 

 For an instant I considered saying that I was busy that Wednesday, but only for an instant. Candy's warnings shot through my mind and I remembered telling her that I had no intention of letting Freda get her hooks in me, but that night had been so damned hot! 

 "Yes baby, Wednesday." 

 She laughed. I baby, you sissy boy." 

 I walked her to the door of her apartment and after she opened the door she turned and kissed me and it was a scorcher. "I glad you are my sissy boy" and she turned and went into her apartment. 

 As I drove back to my place I thought back over the last couple of days and I was amazed that I had survived them. I was equally amazed that any of it had happened to me at all. Here I was fucking damned near everything in sight and it was all because I wouldn't cheat on Elaine and it was because I kept my dick in my pants that Leslie took up with me and then every thing led from that. And that gave me a problem I was going to have to figure out how to handle. There was Marge and there was Freda. I liked playing with both of them, but could I do it at the same time or was I going to have to choose? Marge didn't want a committed long term relationship and that was fine with me. Freda was an unknown. I knew what Candy told me that she had overheard and if it was true I knew that I wasn't going to let it happen. But there was the language thing and maybe Candy had misunderstood what she'd heard. I knew that I still wanted more of Freda. I drove home and was asleep the instant my head hit the pillow. 

 I woke up at noon and drove over to my brother's place and we celebrated Kyle's 16th birthday and my brother and I talked a bit about Elaine and her lawyer and he told me he might have something for me by the middle of the coming week. 

 Sunday I went by Marge's place and nothing sexually happened. Her period had started two days early, so we drank beer and played cribbage until it was time for me to go home. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I had to work some overtime and it was nearly seven when I got to Riley's. Candy was taking a tray of drinks to a table and as she walked by me she said: 

 "Married yet?" 

 I stuck my tongue out at her and joined the group at the tables. Candy brought me a PBR and when I took my first pull on the bottle I noticed Leslie on the other side of the table. She winked at me and curiosity got the better of me and so I got up and asked her to dance. 

 "I haven't seen much of you in here lately." 

 "Yeah but you will being seeing more of me from now on." 

 "How's that?" 

 "I just dumped one hundred and eighty pound of dead weight." 

 "I hate to appear dense, but what does that mean?" 

 "I caught Rory with another woman and I kicked him to the curb. You still hanging with Marge?" 

 "We see each other as I'm sure Susan has told you." 

 "Well, I know about the threesome she was going to have with you and Marge that never came off. I know about your Wednesday night. Susan couldn't wait to call me and tell me how much she liked having anal and I got a blow by blow description of your Thursday night, but she hasn't said anything about Marge and you." 

 "Marge and I aren't really a couple, but we do see each other two or three times a week." 

 "Was what she told me about Thursday true? Did you and Gary really both do her at the same time? One in the pussy and one in the ass?" 

 "Yes Leslie my sweet, all of it is true and we all have you to thank for it." 

 "Me? How do I get the credit?" 

 "Susan and Marge chose me because you told Susan that I could be trusted to keep my mouth shut." 

 "Really? Then I guess you owe me one. Any chance I could collect tonight?" 

 "Sorry, but I've already committed to Marge." 

 "Maybe Marge will let me join you." 

 "Why would she do that?" 

 "I'm sure that you know about Marge and Susan." 

 "And?" 

 "I've been known to participate with them and your threesome with Marge and Susan didn't come off so maybe there is a chance we could make it work with Marge and me." 

 "I'll be honest with you sweetie. Marge is 'out of order' tonight and even if she wasn't I don't think there is any way I could handle the two of you tonight. I still haven't recovered from Wednesday and Thursday. Maybe some other time, but even then you will have to talk to Marge about it, not me." 

 "Okay, but I'm not letting you forget that you owe me one." 

 I walked her back to her seat at the table and then I took my beer and joined Marge and Susan in their booth." 

 "We still on for tonight even though I'm a little defective?" 

 "We are even on cribbage games and we need to break the tie. And it is a good thing you are defective because I'm not sure that I would be able to do you justice after the hurt your buddy here put on me last week." 

 Susan laughed and said, "But it was fun and Gary wants to do it again. Not right away, but he says he would like to do it at least once a month." 

 "Oh no you don't" Marge said, "It's my turn next." 

 "Who are you going to get besides Rob?" 

 "Gary of course. We will keep it all in one tight little group. You, me, Gary and Rob." 

 "Whoa up there guys. I'm not all that sure that I want to get in the habit of doing things like that. As long as I have a say in the matter..." 

 "You don't" Marge and Susan said almost together. 

 "I don't what?" 

 "Have any say in the matter." 

 "I don't?" 

 "No" Marge said. "You gave yourself to us when you agreed to our first proposal to do a threesome. You belong to us buddy-boy." 

 Susan laughed and said, "Don't make that face at us. You know damned well that you are the luckiest man in this room. There isn't one of your buddies sitting over there at that table who wouldn't give their right arm to be in your shoes." 

 "Come on girls, I'm only human. I'm not a perpetual hard on. You wore me out Thursday night Suze. If you can do that in one night how do you expect me to do what you are proposing?" 

 "In the first place, I didn't wear you out on Thursday and you know it. It was Thursday on top of Wednesday that drained you and when you stop and consider what you did those two nights running I don't think you have any reason to sit there and say 'poor me' and expect me to buy it." 

 Then Marge said, "It isn't going to be every night. Once a month for you, Susan and Gary and once a month for you, Gary, I and we can space them two weeks apart so that you can get plenty of rest." 

 "How do you even know that Gary will go along with it?" 

 "He will if he wants to keep me and Susan having threesomes with him." 

 "Got to get a move on" Susan said and she picked up her purse and left. 

 I asked Marge to dance and as we moved onto the dance floor and she moved into my arms she said: 

 "You don't really have to do a threesome with Gary and me if you don't want to." 

 "I didn't say that I didn't want to. I had a good time with Susan and Gary and I'm sure I would have an even better time with you and Gary." 

 "Even better?" 

 "Sure. You and I have a lot going for us; much more than I had going with Susan. My problem is too much too quick." 

 "Too much too quick?" 

 "Yeah. For years and through two marriages I was a faithful husband and enjoyed sex with my wives two and three times a week. Suddenly I'm divorced and sex seems to have taken over my life. I shouldn't complain because it all has been extremely enjoyable, but in reality I'm fairly conservative and having multiple partners is a stretch for me. I'm not sure that I want to get into it too deeply. I'm more of a one woman at a time guy." 

 "Like I said sweetie, you don't have to do it, but I would like to try it at least once and I would really rather it be with someone I know pretty well and would be comfortable doing it with and that would pretty much be you." 

 "I'll do it with you at least once baby, but I'm not promising that I'll do it twice a month." 

 "As long as I get to do it once I'll be happy. Who knows, I may not even like it." 

 When the song ended I walked her back to her booth and she picked up her purse and said: 

 "I'm going to go home and soak in the tub. I'm cramping a little, but I should be ready to play on Wednesday okay?" 

 It was on the tip of my tongue to say yes when I remembered that Wednesday was Freda's day off and she was expecting me. 

 "How about Thursday? I have to go over to my cousin's on Wednesday and I probably won't leaving his place until late." 

 "Thursday it is then." 

 As she walked toward the door I felt bad about fibbing to her. I'm not usually that kind of guy. We had an understanding that we were not going to be forever and I could have old her I had a date and she probably would have accepted that, but for some reason I didn't feel that it would be good for everyone concerned if she knew it was someone else from the bar. 

 Tuesday after work I skipped going to the bar and went straight home. I figured if I went to bed early and got a good nights sleep I'd be in shape for my date with Freda. Wednesday at three my cell phone beeped and it was Freda. 

 "You at the bar meet me okay sissy boy?" 

 I said fine and after work I rushed home, showered and dressed and got to Riley's parking lot at six-ten. As I pulled into the lot Freda got out of her car and came over and got in mine. I headed for Angelina's. Angelina's had the best veal scaloppini I had ever eaten and I was looking forward to it when Freda slid over next to me and put her hand on the bulge in my trousers. 

 "Your place we go sissy boy" and she squeezed my cock. "This what I hungry for." 

 "Ooookay" I thought as I turned around and headed back toward my apartment. 

 Freda was insatiable. She just did not want to stop. We finally had to of course when I reached the point where Mr. Happy just refused to play any more. It was ten to two when Freda said, "I go now" and got up to get dressed. I drove her back to Riley's so she could pick up her car and as I pulled up next to it I asked her when we could get together again. 

 "No more sissy boy. This last time. Husband today from Germany come. He think I now at work. You still my sissy boy no?" 

 "Yes Freda, I'll always be your sissy boy." 

 "And I be baby?" 

 I pulled her to me and kissed her and then said, "You will always be baby." 

 She smiled at me and got out of the car and as she was getting in her car I saw Candy come out of the bar and as she walked to her car she looked at me and made the "shame, shame" sign with her fingers and then she got in her car and drove off. 

 To be continued.  

 

 

===

Naturally the first thing I did when I got to Riley's the next day was corner Candy and ask her about the "shame shame" sign she'd made the night before. 

 "What do you expect when you are messing around with a married woman? Shame shame on you." 

 "Give me a break okay? I didn't know she was married and come to think of it you didn't know either. You were the one who told me she was looking for a sucker to marry her so she could stay in this country." 

 "Ain't that just like a man. Trying to blame a poor little girl like me when you been bad. One more shame shame on you." 

 "You trying to tell me I can't win here?" 

 "You got it sport." 

 I joined the gang at the tables and Candy brought me a beer. The evenings topics were football and politics again and we were discussing the latest bone- headed maneuver our illustrious governor had pulled when Leslie pulled me off my chair to dance with her. As we danced she said: 

 "I talked to Marge today." 

 "Oh?" 

 "I mentioned that a three way with her, me and you might be fun and she agreed. All I need is for you to say yes." 

 "And if I don't?" 

 "I'll spread the rumor that you have thirty-seven different strains of sexually transmitted diseases." 

 "Thirty-seven?" 

 "What can I say? You must be very, very sexually active." 

 "You are an evil person. Fortunately for me I have a defense to use." 

 "And that would be?" 

 "That I got fourteen of them from you when you pulled a train at my birthday party." 

 "And you say that I am evil. Okay, I'll drop the blackmail, but while I had her on the phone I told her I was going to hustle you tonight. You admitted that you owed me one, remember?" 

 "And what did Marge say to that?" 

 "She wished me luck." 

 "I need to change bars. I'm getting to be too much taken for granted in this one." 

 "Oh you poor baby you. Life is just so unfair to you. Your place or mine?" 

 "Your place; its closer." 

 "Give me a fifteen minute head start." 

 She finished her drink and then said "Good night" and left. I ordered another PBR and nursed it while listening to the guys talk football and when fifteen minutes had gone by I got up and left. On the way to Leslie's I wondered why Marge had given Leslie the go-ahead. She was finally off her monthly and I know how horny she must be and she was expecting me to be at her place to scratch her itch, so why tell Leslie to take a shot? I figured that it must be because of the talk we'd had about my reluctance to get involved in multiple partner sex. She was going to let Leslie work to soften me up for the idea. 

 When I got to Leslie's place I found a post it note on the front door saying "come on in." I walked in and couldn't resist calling out, "Honey, I'm home." 

 "In the bedroom" I heard so I headed that way. When I got there Leslie was lying naked on the bed. She looked at me and said: 

 "What's wrong with you? Why didn't you leave a trail of discarded clothes between the front door and this bed? Just thinking of me on the drive over should have had you inflamed with passion. Get your clothes off and get over here." 

 "Yes ma'am. Whatever you say ma'am. I'm here to serve you ma'am." 

 "Wise ass. You wouldn't dawdle if it was you who was hurting. You do need to hurry. It's been four months since I dumped Rory and I'm so horny I should be braying like a goat." 

 As I climbed on the bed she said, "No foreplay lover; just down and dirty for the first one." 

 "Oh? You expect more than one?" 

 "Damned straight I do. You aren't leaving this place until I can't get you up any more." 

 That proved to be four hours later after two sessions of regular intercourse, one session of anal, two portions of head (giving and receiving) and a little sixty-nine. I was too whipped to get out of bed and go home so I spent the night cuddled up to Leslie. Leslie and I showered together in the morning and it almost led us back to the bed, but then Leslie said: 

 "Damn it to hell! I want to, but I can't. I'd end up being late for work and I can't let that happen. Marge is going out of town for the weekend. Can I have you?" 

 "Promise that I'll still be alive come Monday morning?" 

 "Why would you ask that?" 

 "Haven't you been trying to fuck me to death? It sure seemed that way last night." 

 "I promise I won't hurt you -- at least not too much." 

 "How about I pick you up here about six-thirty and take you to dinner?" 

 "Okay, but I get to pick dessert." 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 I had two jobs that I needed to finish by the end of the day so I pretty much kept my nose to the grindstone. I did make time during my lunch break to call Marge. I needed to make sure that she was cool with what I was doing with Leslie. I wasn't dumb and Leslie had stopped us the first time around when she found "her true love" and if it happened once it could happen again. Marge, on the other hand, had let me know upfront that she wasn't interested in any emotional entanglements and we could bounce the bedsprings for as long as I liked as long as I didn't expect any more out of our relationship than fun. She told me that she was okay with my seeing Leslie and in fact she was the one who sent Leslie my way when Leslie was talking with her and Susan about dumping Rory and how honey she was getting. 

 At four-thirty I got a call from my brother telling me that I was right on in my take on Elaine's lawyer and to swing by and see him some time during the weekend. 

 That night I took Leslie to Spagnola's for dinner and then we swung by the Silver Slipper for drinks and dancing. We ended up at my place and Leslie spent the better part of the night trying to reduce me to a quivering puddle of jelly and meeting with a fair amount of success. We stopped at the Village Inn for breakfast when I took her home in the morning and over pancakes we made plans for the evening. She wanted to stay in and would fix dinner for us. 

 I dropped her at her place and then I went home and did my usual Saturday chores. I washed the truck, cleaned my apartment and did my laundry. At five I was back at Leslie's and following dinner we played gin rummy and talked until Leslie finally threw her cards down and said: 

 "Enough of this shit. You know what I really want to do so let's get with it." 

 It was another exhausting night for me. Leslie fixed us breakfast in the morning and then asked if I would see her again that evening and I told her no, that I was going to be spending the day with my brother and the visit would probably run late. 

 "Well I'm not going anywhere today so if you decide you would like to stop by just give me a call and don't worry about how late it might be." 

 I spent the afternoon with my brother and his family and when I left at nine I was in a marvelous mood and wanted to celebrate. I called Leslie and told her I could stop by after all if it was still okay with her. 

 "How do you want me waiting? With a deck of cards and a pad to keep score on in my hands or naked with my high heels on?" 

 "Damn! Decisions, decisions, decisions. Maybe you should just surprise me." 

 When I rang the bell and she answered the door the very first thing I noticed is that she didn't have a deck of cards in her hand. Somehow I was not surprised. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday morning during my first break I called Gerald Montrose. I told the woman who answered the phone that I needed to speak to Mr. Montrose. 

 "And this is in regard to?" 

 "Just tell him that Rob McKeean is calling. I'm pretty sure that he will take the call." 

 After a few seconds Montrose came on the line. "Mr. McKeean, what can I do for you?" 

 "The fifteen days is almost up and I decided that I need to get together with you to make the necessary arrangements." 

 "Decided not to be a guest of the county again?" 

 "Yeah. I've got better things to do with my time now." 

 "I have an opening tomorrow at one-thirty." 

 "I'll be there." 

 I skipped going to Riley's that night. I wanted to be very clear headed when I had my meeting with Montrose. I showed up for my one-thirty meeting at one- twenty and believing that Montrose would be on a power trip since he had managed to beat me down I fully expected that he would make me wait so I'd brought a magazine to read. Montrose did not disappoint me. It was one forty- five when he secretary said: 

 "Mr. Montrose will see you now." 

 She ushered me into his office and as I expected he did not stand and offer his hand. He motioned to a chair and I sat down. He looked at me for a moment and then smiled a 'wolfish' kind of smile and then said: 

 "First off, and this is not part of what the judge ordered, but before I go in front of him and tell him that the matter has been taken care of I will expect that my fees in this matter be taken care of in full." 

 "Somehow I thought that you might say something like that." 

 I slid a large manila envelope across the desk to him. "While you read that I'll think about your condition." 

 My brother was an insurance adjuster and there were times when he had to employ a detective agency. Like the time a guy swore he hurt his back on the job and continued to collect benefits while saying that his back prevented him from going back to work. A private detective got film of the man lifting large rocks while building a retaining wall in his backyard. My brother used that detective agency a lot and after recognizing Montrose as the man who came up to Elaine and put his hand on her shoulder the night she locked me out of the house I asked my brother if he could arrange for the detective agency to check out Montrose. Bill had gotten me a reduced rate and the agency's report is what I had just slid across the table to Montrose. I gave him a few minutes to go over the contents and then I said: 

 "As you can see it is quite complete. I will admit that I was surprised to find that you and Elaine were hanging horns on me long before she asked for the divorce. It is unfortunate for you that the Shangri-La Motel keeps its parking lot video surveillance tapes for two years. Those tapes show that you and Elaine were frequent visitors for a good three months before she came to me and asked me to cut her loose. The ironic thing is that the motel was keeping those tapes on the advice of their attorney. One of your own compatriots is responsible for nailing you. The stuff from the last two weeks are the result of my private detective checking you out and you have only yourself to blame for that. I didn't recognize you in court that day as the man who came up to Elaine and familiarly put his had on her shoulder until you smiled and laughed at me for being so dumb as to renew my driver's license. 

 "Anyway, I heard your condition and I've decided that I don't care for it and I'm not going to do it. Here are my conditions. You eat your fee. You go in front of the judge and tell him all arrearages have been taken care of and you will file the necessary paperwork to amend the divorce decree to remove the part where it says I have to pay alimony. In exchange for you doing all that I will promise that a copy of the report that you have in your hands will not find its way to the states bar association ethics committee. I will also see to it that it doesn't get distributed to the congregation of your church. By the way I am shocked, just shocked that a devout Jehovah's Witness such as you hold yourself out to be would become involved with a married member of your congregation. 

 "Also, since the surveillance tapes show your association with Elaine started well before she asked me for a divorce I would be within my rights to file an alienation of affections suit against you. I will forego that pleasure if all of my conditions are met. 

 "And -- this is a pretty big one -- I will not get a copy of the report to your wife. As an experienced divorce attorney I'm sure that you know what is likely to happen if she doesn't like what she reads. " 

 I stood up. 

 "You can keep that. It is just one of many copies. No need to rush your decision. Take some time and think it over. Call me by three tomorrow and let me know how you want to play it. If you decide to take me up on my offer I'll leave it to you to explain to Elaine why I won't be sending her any more money." 

 "I don't need to wait until tomorrow. I don't have any choice and you know it. But I can't just stop court ordered alimony." 

 "Sure you can. All Elaine has to do is say that she has remarried. It should be no problem for her to tell that lie. After all, she spent the last part of her marriage lying to me and it didn't seem to bother her." 

 "But what if I can't get her to lie?" 

 "Your problem, not mine. Just make sure that you solve it before we are due back in court which, by the way, is the day after tomorrow. The clock is ticking." 

 I walked out of Montrose's office with the biggest smile on my face that I'd had in years. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That night at Riley's I was ready to party. I danced with every girl there, bought a couple of rounds for the table and had a grand time. The only thing missing was that there were none of the ladies I had been playing with in attendance that night. A night of rousing sex would have been the perfect cap to the day, but it wasn't to be. 

 As I was getting ready to leave I saw Candy looking at me and I quickly debated taking a shot at her and just as quickly decided not to. I figured that Candy wasn't a first night 'wham, bam' girl and I would need time to work her into my bedroom. Besides, with Marge and Leslie I already had too much going on at Riley's, but she did smile when I blew her a kiss on my way out. 

 Wednesday was a hard day at work. I needed to catch up on what I'd had to let slide on Tuesday because of my meeting with Montrose and I needed to make a big dent in Wednesday's workload. It was imperative that I have all of the scheduled work done by Friday so we could meet the deadline in our contract with the customer. To catch up I had to work late and I didn't get to make it to Riley's that night. By the end of Thursday I was not only caught up, but a little ahead of schedule and barring a catastrophe the project would be done by noon on Friday. 

 I'd been an hour at the table with the guys when Marge and Susan walked in and sat down in a booth. I let them get settled in and then I went over and asked Marge to dance. As we danced she said: 

 "I missed you last night." 

 "Had to work late." 

 "You could still have stopped by my place last night when you got off work." 

 "No I couldn't." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because that would have been taking you for granted and that is one thing I'll never do. We have a good thing going and the last thing I need to do is show up at an inappropriate time and blow it." 

 "Sometimes you say the nicest things sweetie, but while you might not want to take me for granted I'm afraid I can't say the same thing about you." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I'll tell you when we get back to the booth with Susan." 

 We finished the dance and I walked her back to her booth and then slid in beside her. "Show him" she said to Susan. Susan took a piece of paper out of her purse and handed to me. 

 "What is it?" 

 "The schedule we came up with for you" Marge said. "I told you that I might be taking you for granted. It starts next Friday because Gary is always home on a Friday. He has seen the schedule and he is okay with it." 

 I looked at the sheet of paper. 

 Friday 8/8 Gary, Rob and Susan. 

 Friday 8/15 Rob, Susan and Marge 

 Friday 8/22 Rob, Gary and Marge 

 Friday 8/29 Rob, Marge and Leslie 

 I looked up from the sheet and slid it back to Susan. "No" I said. Clearly that was not the expected response because almost in sync Marge and Susan said, "What do you mean no?" 

 "I mean no. I'm not going along with it." 

 "Why the hell not?" Marge asked. 

 "Because I'm not a piece of meat that you can do whatever you want with. I like sex, but I also like it to be a bit spontaneous. And while some people may doubt it I do have a life. The eighth I have a bachelor party to attend and on the twenty-second I will be leaving for Chicago with my brother and we will be gone all weekend." 

 I looked at Susan and said, "I enjoyed my evening with you and your husband and it was something that I would not mind doing again, but only once in a while. I am not the least bit interested in doing it as a regularly scheduled occurrence." 

 Susan gave me a nasty look and said, "Well excuuuusssse me." She picked up the schedule and put it in her purse and then stood up and said to Marge, "I'll call you later" and then left. 

 "You certainly handled that well" Marge said. 

 "What did you expect? I meant it when I said that I have a life. You want to make plans that include me you need to get me involved in making those plans, not just hand them to me and say, "Here is what you are going to do." 

 "That maybe, but you could have been a little more diplomatic about it. You could have just said that you had plans for the 8th and 23rd." 

 "And then she would have gone home and worked out another schedule and said, "Here." 

 "It wasn't just Susan. I was part of it too." 

 "All I can say is just like I don't want to take you for granted you should maybe not take me for granted either." 

 "Maybe I shouldn't take you for anything" and she picked up her purse, nudged me out of the booth and then stood up and walked away. As she was heading for the door I wondered how I got to be the bad guy. "Fuck 'em!" I thought as I walked back to the group at the tables. "Who needs the fucking grief!" 

 I had one more beer, danced with Nancy and Sally and then headed on home. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 When I got off work Friday I headed for the state campgrounds at Lake Evans. I already had the tent and camping gear in the truck and didn't need to stop for anything but ice. I did nothing at all that weekend except lie on the beach, soak up sun and read a couple of books. 

 When I got home Sunday night there was a message from Elaine on the answering machine and I wondered how she had gotten the number. The message was short: 

 "Please call me Rob. 555-8164." 

 I wondered what she wanted, but not enough to call her back. I might have called her before finding out about her and Montrose, but certainly not after. 

 While sunning myself on the beach over the weekend I'd had a lot of time to think. I decided that I was spending too much money and spending too much time at Riley's. I knew why I'd been doing it. I'd been living day to day expecting to find myself sitting in jail because of my divorce from Elaine and my attitude toward the courts and their orders, but now that threat was gone and it was time for me to get on with my life. 

 Monday after work I went over to a fitness center close to my apartment and signed up for a membership. I got a tour of the facilities and then went home and fixed myself some dinner and then settled in with a book. Tuesday I was at the center when the doors opened at five in the morning and I started working on getting myself back in shape. I laid out a program for myself that included both cardio and strength routines. I would work on the circuit machines and in the free weight room on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and do laps in the pool on Tuesday and Thursday. 

 I skipped Riley's again that night and finished the book I'd started the night before. 

 On the theory that "all work and no play makes Rob a dull boy" I stopped at Riley's after work on Friday. As always seemed to be the case the first one I saw when I walked in was Candy and she gave me a smile and a "Where have you been stranger?" I told her that I was cutting way back on my drinking and she said, "Good for you." 

 I joined the group at the tables and about fifteen minutes after I sat down Marge and Susan came in. They took a booth and out of the corner of my eye I kept a watch on them. They kept looking over at our table as if expecting me to get up and come over, but I just sipped my PBR and talked to the people at the table. The live band came in and began setting up and Nancy leaned over the table and said:  

 

 

===

"I get first dance Rob." 

 As the band started on their first tune I got up and I saw Marge shift position to make getting up easier when I came to ask her to dance, but I didn't go over to her and I wasn't looking her way to see how she took my taking Nancy out onto the floor. I danced with Nancy, Sally, Debbie and Marsha and didn't even look over at Marge and Susan. 

 At eleven forty-five I called it a night and headed for the door. Candy stopped me and told me that she had a message for me from Freda. 

 "She would like to see you before you leave." 

 I walked back to the kitchen and when Freda saw me she smiled and said: 

 "Hello my sissy boy." 

 "What's up Freda?" 

 "I off Wednesday next sissy boy. We go out." 

 It was a statement and not a question. "What about your husband?" 

 "He back to Germany go. We go out yes?" 

 "No Freda. Sorry, but I don't mess around with married women." 

 "Oh sissy boy being silly." 

 "I'm not being silly. I didn't know you were married when I took you out before. If I had known we never would have gone out. Good night Freda." 

 As I was walking toward the door Candy came up to me. "I heard what you told her." She handed me a slip of paper and said, "Call me." 

 Saturday I woke up and fixed myself some breakfast and then started on my weekend chores. I was going through my pockets before tossing the dirty clothes into the washing machine and found the piece of paper that Candy had given me. I looked at my watch and saw that it was eleven-ten and I figured that Candy would be up by then so I gave her a call. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Good morning beautiful. It's Rob." 

 "Good morning yourself." 

 "You said I should give you a call. What's up?" 

 "A touch of curiosity. A while back when we were discussing Freda you said she wasn't your type and when I asked you what your type was you pretty much described me." 

 "Yes I did, didn't I." 

 "I'm curious. Were you pulling my leg or were you serious?" 

 "I was absolutely serious." 

 "Then why haven't you done anything about it?" 

 "I got the feeling that my going out with Freda didn't set too well with you. I got the feeling that you were looking down on me so I kept my distance." 

 "You were partly right. I was put off by your going out with a married woman, but then I realized that you didn't know she was married when you took her out." 

 "Why did that upset you?" 

 "Not too complicated. I've had three relationships go under because the guy cheated on me. I liked you. I liked you enough to tell you I would go out with you to keep you away from being the target of Freda's plan. Then you went out with her and it turned out that she was married and I kind of forgot that we both thought she had a plan to hook an American and get married. I keyed in on the fact that you were going out with a married woman and a man who would go out with a married woman would probably cheat on his own girl and that turned me off on you." 

 "But I told you when you pulled that "shame/shame" on me that I didn't know she was married and reminded you of the fact that you were the one who told me about her plan to get married." 

 "I know, but she is a hotie and after you had been with her a couple of times I honestly thought you probably would keep on going. Most guys I've known wouldn't walk away from something like Freda once they had scored. But then last night I heard what you told her and I realized that I had totally misjudged you." 

 "What makes you think that I scored?" 

 "Freda couldn't stop talking about you when we took our breaks together and that she couldn't wait for her husband to leave so she could climb in your bed again. I really didn't think a man could say no to something that hot even if he knew she was married." 

 "We obviously need to talk more about this. I know you have to work tonight, but what are you doing tomorrow?" 

 "Well, it is my day off. What do you have in mind?" 

 "Dinner, a drink or two and talk." 

 "I can do that." 

 We set a time and she gave me directions to her place and then I got busy cleaning my apartment. As I cleaned and dusted I thought of the hypocrisy of my stand where Freda was concerned. I had played with Susan and she was married. Granted that the second time was with her husband and I didn't know she was married the first time we got together, but I sure knew that she was married when we had our little anal marathon and that was flat out cheating with a married woman and it hadn't bothered me. Susan didn't consider it cheating because as far as she was concerned she was doing it for her husband, but I couldn't take the high ground on that one. Oh well, Candy didn't know any of that and I sure as hell wasn't going to tell her. 

 Around six the phone rang and I let the answering machine take the call. It was Elaine. 

 "Please call me Rob. It is important that I talk with you. Please Rob, call me." 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

I was curious as to what Elaine had to say that I might consider important and that curiosity got the best of me and I was reaching for the phone when it rang. It was Leslie. 

 "I took a chance that you might be home. You doing anything tonight?" 

 "No plans other than mopping floors, washing windows and dusting whatever needs it and vacuuming the rugs." 

 "Oh baby, that does sound like fun. Could I maybe interest you in dropping all that fun stuff and coming over to my place so I can put you to work?" 

 "What kind of work do you have in mind?" 

 "Exhausting sweaty work. Lots of pushing and pulling." 

 "Sweaty pushing and pulling? Sounds better than doing laundry. What time would you like me there?" 

 "Fifteen minutes ago would be fine with me. Door will be unlocked. Come on in and see if you can find me." 

 I had no trouble finding her. I found her on her bed, all spread out and waiting. 

 Following some rather strenuous and sweaty pushing and pulling Leslie was fondling my limp cock and I was playing with her right nipple when I said: 

 "I'm a little surprised that I'm here." 

 "Why would you be surprised?" 

 "I know how close you are with Susan and Marge and I thought that they would have soured you on me." 

 "Why would they do that?" 

 I told her what had happened the last time I'd talked with the two of them and that I hadn't spoken with them since. 

 "I've been out of town and haven't talked with either of them so I didn't know, but I don't see why it would keep me from calling you or you from seeing me. It does upset me a little though. It means I won't get my three-way with you and Marge." 

 "Is that so important to you?" 

 "Not really, but it would have been fun." 

 "You know anybody else who might be open to it?" 

 "Not off hand." 

 "Well, if you find anyone I'll see to it that you get your fun." 

 "Marge is definitely out of the picture?" 

 "Given the mood she was in and the way she stomped off I'd have to say yes." 

 Her hands working on my cock had produced results and I asked her if she was ready for more sweaty pushing and pulling. She was. 

 Just before I left to go home Leslie asked me if I could come over Sunday afternoon after she got home from visiting her parents and I told her that I couldn't because I already had a date for Sunday. 

 "Anyone I know?" 

 "Candy from the bar." 

 "That slut? Why her?" 

 "Why not and why is she a slut?" 

 "She's coming between us and as far as I'm concerned that makes her a slut." 

 "Coming between us? I though all we are is friends who like to play together. I thought all you wanted me for was to make the bedsprings sing every now and then. At least that is what you led me to believe way back then." 

 "That was then." 

 "So what has happened since then?" 

 "A lot for me, but apparently not much for you." 

 She got up on her toes and kissed my cheek and said, "Good luck with Candy." 

 As I drove back to my place I thought about what Leslie had just inferred. Could there really be anything there? When I got home the light was blinking on the answering machine. There were three messages -- two from Elaine practically begging me to call her and one from Shelly telling me that Elaine had called her and had asked her to try and get me to call. I debated calling Elaine and getting it over with, but then thought about my date the next day with Candy. The odds were good that I wouldn't be in all that great a mood after talking to Elaine and I did not want to be carrying a bad mood when I went to pick up Candy. I unplugged the phone, turned off the answering machine and went to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Candy looked sexy as hell when I picked her up and it wasn't something that she had to work hard at. She was wearing a blouse and a skirt the fell to just below the knee and high heels. Nothing that was attention getting, but she exuded sex appeal. 

 We had dinner at The Texas Steakhouse and then caught a movie at the Cineplex 2. After the movie we stopped at the grotto for drinks. There wasn't a live band on Sunday, but we did dance to several songs that were on the jukebox. 

 Candy's sexual aura had been working on me all night and I know that she felt my erection a couple of times when we were dancing to slow tunes, but she did nothing to indicate she was aware of it. When I took her home and walked her to her door I was ready to explode and I didn't know if I could hold it until we got to her bedroom. At her door she turned and kissed me on the cheek and told me that she had enjoyed herself. 

 "I had a nice time Rob. Thank you." 

 She turned and put her key in the door, opened it and then turned back to me, "Goodnight Rob" and then she was inside and the door closed behind her. I stood there for several seconds and then I took my raging hard on home. As I drove home I was cursing Candy for being a fucking prick tease and it wasn't until after I got home and had taken care of my problem that I calmed down enough to realize that Candy had not done one thing to lead me on. All she had done was be herself. I doubt that she even knew how much sex appeal she radiated. 

 And where in the hell did I get off expecting that every woman I spent time with would crawl into bed with me? I never thought that way before I started stopping at Riley's so why was I thinking it when I went out with Candy?" The easy answer of course was that I had scored with so many from Riley's that I expected to score with anyone I hooked up with from Riley's. Leslie, Betsy, Marge, Susan, Freda -- and to some extent, Karen -- had all given me a swelled head. Candy merely woke me up to something that I had known all along. 

 I was not God's gift to women. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 Monday when I got up to go to work I plugged the phone back in and turned the answering machine back on and then headed off to the gym. After a good work out I hit the small café close to work for a bite of breakfast and after three cups of coffee I headed on into work. 

 The day went quickly and even though I had decided to cut down on my visits to Riley's I decided to stop that night. I didn't want to wait until Friday to drop in because I didn't know how Candy would take me dating her and then staying gone for almost a week. 

 I took a seat at the tables and since I hadn't eaten since breakfast when Candy brought me my beer I ordered a steak sandwich. Seven or eight minutes later when Candy brought me my sandwich and set it down in front of me she whispered: 

 "I wouldn't eat that if I were you. I saw Freda spit on it after she took it off the grill. I won't charge you for it. Another beer?" 

 "Yes please." 

 I glanced around the room to see who was there and as I did I saw Freda standing in the door to the kitchen watching me. I picked up the sandwich and pretended to take a bite out of it and out of the corner of my eye I saw Freda smile and then walk back into the kitchen. When Candy brought me my beer I had her take the sandwich and toss it. I could have eaten it and it wouldn't have hurt me any. God knows that Freda and I had swapped plenty of spit when we tongue wrestled on our dates, but I wouldn't eat the damned thing just because! 

 When I glanced around the room I saw Marge sitting in a booth alone and I kept an eye on her without letting her know I was watching. The juke box was banging away and every time I got up I saw her tense up a little as she expected me to come over, but each time I asked one of the girls at our table to take a trip out onto the dance floor. Given the way Marge had stalked out on me the last time we talked I had decided that if there was going to be a thaw in our relationship she was going to have to be the one to make the first move. She left about an hour after I got there. 

 When Candy took her break she sat at the end of the bar and sipped a Coke while munching on an order of onion rings and I went over and took the stool next to her. 

 "You have any plans for next Sunday?" 

 "Not yet?" 

 "Would you like to go out with me again?" 

 "Rob, you are a nice guy and I like you, but we aren't going to be going anywhere. I enjoyed myself last night, but there was no spark. We will never be any more than just friends." 

 "Friends with benefits?" 

 "No Rob, just friends." 

 "I don't mean to be crude, but back when you were trying to save me from Freda you led me to believe that you would take me to bed to keep me away from her." 

 "I was mad Rob. I was pissed at Freda for being such a scheming bitch and I wasn't going to let her get away with it. And in that mood I probably said some things I should not have and didn't really mean. I'm sorry Rob; I didn't mean to lead you on." 

 "No problem sweetie. I learned a long time ago that you can't win them all, but it does hurt a little when you can't win the one you really want to win." 

 "That's a sweet thing to say. Thank you. I've got to get back to work" and she got up and went back to waiting on customers. 

 I saw Freda looking at me from the kitchen and for just a moment I considered...nah! 

 The evening had lost its luster with Candy's gentle shoot down and I decided to call it a night. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The light was blinking on the answering machine. Three calls from Elaine and one from Shelly. Shelly's call was a "Please call Elaine Rob. As a favor for me?" 

 I got a beer from the fridge and as I drank it I tried to think of a reason that might have Elaine calling me and saying that it was important. I couldn't think of a single thing. I liked Shelly a lot and if she wanted a favor I guess I needed to grant it. Elaine's messages had always included a phone number so I replayed the messages and got the number and with the feeling that I would probably regret it I punched the numbers into the phone. 

 "Hello?" 

 "What do you want Elaine?" 

 There was silence on the other end. 

 "Elaine?" 

 "Sorry. I just never thought you would call. It took me by surprise." 

 "What do you want?" 

 "I want to talk with you." 

 "We are talking Elaine." 

 "No Rob, I mean I want to sit down with you and talk in person." 

 "I don't see any need for that Elaine. Things are done and settled between us and I can't see any reason for seeing you again." 

 "I know you probably hate me and I suppose I can't really blame you, but I need to talk to you and I need to ask you for a big favor. I can't do it on the phone Rob; I need to do it face to face." 

 I did not want to do it, but I was curious and it was a curiosity that would never be satisfied unless I met with her. 

 "When and where would you like to do this?" 

 "Are you home now?" 

 "Yes." 

 "I can be there in ten minutes." 

 "How do you know where I live?" 

 "Jerry found out when you renewed your driver's license." 

 "Jerry? You mean Gerald Montrose your lover?" 

 "Please Rob." 

 "All right. Come on over." 

 It was closer to fifteen than ten when she knocked on the door. I opened it and let her in. She was wearing a skirt and a blouse and high heels. I knew it was on purpose because she knew that girls in high heels were a turn on for me. Was it a come on or a distraction for me? I pointed at the sofa and she went over and sat down. 

 "Okay Elaine, lets have it." 

 "Could I have a drink of water please?" 

 I got up to get it, but then asked her if she would rather have a Coke or something alcoholic. 

 "A Coke would be nice." 

 I got her one and poured it in a glass and handed it to her. She took a sip and then said: 

 "I'm here to apologize for what I've done to you." 

 I didn't say anything, just looked at her. 

 You were right about the Witnesses; they are more of a cult than a religion. I'm not sorry that I found religion; I just wish now that it could have been a more main stream one." 

 She looked at me as if expecting me to say something -- maybe an "I told you so" -- and when I didn't she said: 

 "They turned on me Rob. I did everything that they wanted me to do and then they turned on me like a pack of dogs." 

 "What did you do to cause it?" 

 "Whatever you did to Jerry scared the hell out of him and he confessed to his wife about us and begged her to forgive him. I guess she did or is at least thinking about it, but at services one day she spit on me and then told everyone why. They all turned their backs on me. All their talks about Christian charity must have been just that -- talk! The man I was working for is a Witness and all of a sudden he told me business was slow and he let me go. The girls I was living with told me that I needed to move out and I had to ask my mother to let me stay with her. My car had a problem and the man I took it to was a Witness and he refused to even look at it for me. All of my so called friends suddenly couldn't find the time to even talk to me. I am so ashamed that I let people like that come between us. I am sorry Rob. I am so very sorry." 

 "You could have said all that over the phone Elaine." 

 "No I couldn't. That would have been the coward's way of doing it. I had to look you right in the eyes when I said it." 

 "What is this big favor that you needed to ask me for?" 

 "Jerry talked me into signing a paper for the court that said I had remarried and that stopped the alimony as far as the courts were concerned. You never paid what the court said, but you did send what you had promised to. I'm here to ask for that Rob. I need something until I can find another job and get back on my feet. Please Rob, just until I can get something going." 

 I looked at the woman who had fucked over me; who had cost me 142 days in jail -- not counting the weekend two weeks ago -- and I wondered why she thought I'd even listen to her let alone help her. Then I thought of the woman I'd loved and had spent six very good years with. I thought about the shitheads who she had left me for and how they had treated her and I decided that I could show that I was better than them. I took out my checkbook and I wrote Elaine a check for a thousand dollars and handed it to her. 

 "It isn't what the court ordered, but it is more than I agreed to. I'll see that you get it on the first of every month until you tell me you don't need it any more. I'll mail it to your mother's place." 

 "Can't I just come here and pick it up" she said as she started to unbutton her blouse and then she continued, "I do love you Rob, I've never stopped and I have missed you." By then she had her blouse off and was reaching for the hooks on her bra. 

 "Stop it Elaine. It isn't necessary." 

 "But I want to Rob." 

 "And I don't so put your blouse back on." 

 She stopped and said, "Is there any chance we can put things back together Rob? Any chance at all?" 

 "None Elaine, none at all. Do you remember the night of the poker game at Tom and Shelly's? Remember telling me that you knew why Shelly was trying to get the both of us together? Remember? We had both been there and felt the pain and so neither of us was likely to inflict that pain on someone else? You forgot that Elaine and then gave me the pain." 

 "I didn't do that Rob. I left you because of your attitude toward me and the Jehovah's Witnesses." 

 "That may be Elaine, but I have video of you and Montrose going into motel rooms weeks before you asked me for a divorce. That was outright cheating Elaine and you know how I feel about that." 

 "I never meant to do that to you Rob. I don't even know how it happened." 

 "How can you not know how it happened? Your skirt goes up, your panties come down, his zipper goes down and his cock comes out and all by magic? He fucked you while you were under some spell and you didn't know about it until later?" 

 "It was almost like that; the not knowing what happened till it was over." 

 "I just have to hear the story behind that statement." 

 "No point to it Rob, at least not since there doesn't seem to be any hope for us." 

 "Humor me Elaine. You owe me that much for the hell you put me through." 

 "You won't like it." 

 "I didn't like any of what you put me through so what's one more thing to not like." 

 "Jerry was one of the ones who was pushing me to divorce you and I kept telling everyone who was pushing that I could bring you around and they all told me that it would never happen. I loved you Rob and I kept telling them I couldn't leave you and I just needed more time to work on you. 

 "It happened on a night after we had argued and you had screamed at me and called me a 'brain washed, brain dead bimbo' and I was hurt Rob. You had never done anything like that to me before. That night I was at a meeting being held at Jerry's house. His wife was out of town for some reason and when the meeting was over Jerry asked me to stay for a minute. After every one else was gone he started in on me about the divorce again. He even told me that he would represent me for free. I told him I couldn't leave you and he said I should because you obviously didn't love me or you would support me in what I wanted. At that and remembering our fight before the meeting I broke down and started to cry. Jerry took me in his arms and tried to comfort me. 

 "He had his arms around me and was holding me and telling me that you didn't deserve me and he kept saying that you didn't really care for me and I began to think that he was right because you had been being so mean to me and at times really rotten where the Witnesses were concerned. I wasn't really thinking clearly when he sat me down on the couch and then kissed me and then things got out of hand. He was saying the things I needed to hear and I wasn't paying any attention to what else he was doing. I was still sobbing into his shoulder and then suddenly I was on my back and he had pushed aside the crotch band of my panties and pushed into me before I even knew what was happening. I tried to push him off of me and I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. It was more of a rape than anything else and when it was over I was sick. Even though it was more like a rape I couldn't come home and tell you. The way you felt about me at that time and given the way you felt about the Witnesses you would have probably said something like, "It serves you right for getting mixed up with those wackos" and then kicked me out of the house. I just didn't believe you would believe me when I said I didn't do it willingly. 

 "Jerry was well liked and I believe that if I would have hollered rape and Jerry said that it wasn't and that I had done it willingly the other members of the church would have sided with him. I didn't know what to do. I was losing you and I was sure that it would be over if I told you and I would have lost all my witness friends if I hollered rape and then I would have had no one. 

 "But after it happened I felt guilty because regardless of how it happened I had still been used by another man and I knew how you felt about that. The next time I saw Jerry he acted as though nothing wrong had happened and he again offered to handle my divorce for nothing. He started treating me like a girlfriend. By then I was sure that you and I were toast and I couldn't afford a lawyer so I kind of slid into a relationship with Jerry. After a couple of weeks I could no longer handle the guilt of facing you any more and I asked for the divorce. 

 "I told Jerry about our agreement and that is how I wanted it handled. I was surprised when he did it different, but he said he had to do it that way because of the way the divorce laws were written. What did I know? Jerry was the lawyer and he knew the law so I listened to him. I'm sorry for the way things turned out Rob. I never meant for it to be that way." 

 "You should have told me Elaine. I probably would have said something like it was what you deserved for getting involved with that bunch, but I never would have thrown you out. You had never lied to me that I knew of so I would have believed you when you told me what had happened. I loved you Elaine and even though we were divorced I still loved you. It wouldn't even have been impossible for us to have gotten back together up until three weeks ago."  

 

 

===

"Three weeks ago? What happened three weeks ago?" 

 "That is when I found out about all of your visits to the motel with Montrose. Up until then we were divorced because of your affiliation with your cult. But three weeks ago I found out that you had been cheating on me even before asking for the divorce and that changed everything. You had it right when you said that you knew where I stood on cheating." 

 I saw the sadness come over her face and then she lowered her head and looked down at the floor. 

 "You should have trusted me back then Elaine. It would have made all the difference in the world." 

 "I am sorry Rob. I really made a mess of things and I can never express how sorry I am that I did it." 

 She got up, thanked me for the check and headed for the door. Just as she opened it I said, "Elaine." She turned back and looked at me. "We can be friends Elaine, but it can never be any more than that." 

 "Thank you for that much Rob. Good night" and then she was gone. 

 I got another beer and settled back in my recliner. I stared at the full moon that was shining through my window and contemplated where I was in my life. The meeting with Elaine had put a final close on that chapter of my life. I was free from the threat of courts and jails. I had taken steps to break away from the habit of stopping at Riley's every night. My joining the gym was already showing benefits as the beer belly I had been building at Riley's was starting to shrink. Things were shaping up and falling into line, but I felt that there was something missing. I finished my beer and drug myself off to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 I don't know what it was -- it was probably something in my subconscious mind - - but something brought me up out of a sound sleep. I found myself sitting up in bed staring at the shadows the full moon was casting on the walls. I don't know where it came from, but suddenly it was there. I reached for the phone and punched in a number. The phone on the other end rang about eight times and then I got a groggy: 

 "Hello?" 

 "Did I wake you?" 

 There was a slight pause and then, "My God Rob. Do you have any idea what time it is?" 

 "No I don't. My alarm clock is broken." 

 "It is three in the morning Rob." 

 "My bad sweetie, but I had a sudden need to know. The last time I was with you as I was leaving you said something that led me to believe that your feelings toward me had changed and that you were thinking of me as more than just a fuck-buddy. Was it my imagination?" 

 There were several moments of silence and then Leslie said, "No Rob; it wasn't your imagination." 

 "Can I see you tonight?" 

 "You can see me tonight if you want to wait that long. I mean I am already awake." 

 "I can be there in twenty." 

 "The door will be unlocked and you know where you can find me." 

 I was there in sixteen and yes, I did find her. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I woke up in the morning Leslie was snuggled up against me and had a leg thrown over my body. When I stirred she moved away and when I turned to look at her I found her up on an elbow looking down at me. I smiled at her and she smiled back and then said: 

 "I guess I told you where I'm at last night on the phone. Where are you?" 

 "A phone call in the middle of the night doesn't give you a clue?" 

 "To be honest about it, no. The last time I talked to you you were on your way to your next conquest. What happened with you and Candy?" 

 "Candy gave me a wake up call." 

 "You lost me there Rob." 

 "How about I tell you all about it over breakfast. Get dressed and I'll take you to Village Inn and lay it all out for you." 

 We were on our second cup of coffee when I started. I told her about my first wife and what she had done to me and then I told her about Elaine and how that had gone down. 

 "I came into Riley's with a severally bruised ego. Two women that I had cared for had basically thrown me away. To put it bluntly, I felt somewhat defective. Why did both of my wives choose someone or something over me? It was obvious that I just wasn't important to either one of them so what was wrong with me? 

 "That was my mindset when I came into Riley's so it came as a surprise when all of a sudden I had ladies showing an interest in me and in a couple of cases actually chasing after me. You know about Betsy, Marge and Susan, but there was more." 

 I told her about Freda and how Candy had offered to save me from Freda and then I told her about how things had gone with Freda and how they had turned out: 

 "And then of course there is you and what we had going. I went from feeling like a total loser where women were concerned to feeling like Mr. Stud Muffin. Because of what Candy had said to me back when she was trying to warn me off Freda I fully expected to end up in Candy's bed or get her into mine, but what I got was a "Thanks, but no thanks." My first thought was "Just where in the hell does she get off saying no to me?" And as soon as I had that thought I realized that I was just a little too full of myself and just where did I get off thinking that I was God's gift to women. 

 "I decided that I needed to reevaluate the way my life was going and the way I was behaving. I decided to add pulling back from the ladies at Riley's to the other changes I was making." 

 "Other changes?" 

 "I'm cutting back on the amount of time I'm spending at Riley's and I've joined a gym to get myself back into decent shape." 

 "Sounds like a plan I should get behind." 

 Then I told her about Elaine's visit and what was said, "And after she was gone I sat, sipped a beer and contemplated my life. I thought back over everything I had done with women and considered what the outcomes had been and I wondered if I would ever again have a meaningful relationship with a woman. In the middle of the night I was suddenly wide awake and realizing that I did have a meaningful relationship if I was smart enough to keep it and hence the phone call." 

 She sat there looking at me and I thought I saw something change in here eyes. 

 "When I woke up this morning" she said, "I was thinking the same thing, but now I don't know." 

 "What has changed between the time you got up and now?" 

 "From what you just told me I can ell exactly where you stand on cheating and because of that I'm not sure that things could work out for us." 

 "What? We aren't even together yet and you are already planning on stepping out on me?" 

 "In a way." 

 "In a way?" 

 "I wouldn't step on you with another man Rob, I can promise you that. But I am bi-sexual and I do have a bi-sexual relationship with both Susan and Marge and on occasion with both at once. I know me well enough to know that I will keep seeing them from time to time. And that would be sex outside of our relationship. By your definition that would be cheating. To that extent there is no way that I can be totally faithful to you. I guess we are over before we even start.

 Funny thing about the Miller 251. When the power is off the damned thing just won't weld. The building lost power around two-thirty and when it wasn't back on by ten after three the boss sent everybody home. 

 As I turned onto our block I saw the car parked in our driveway and I knew what I was going to find when I went into the house. The trail of clothes from the living room down the hall toward the back bedroom was all the confirmation that I needed. I kicked off my shoes so they wouldn't make any noise on the hardwood floor and quietly made my way into the family room. The digital camera was on the bookshelf next to the TV and I checked it to make sure that it had a charge and enough room on the card for several exposures. 

 As quietly as I could I made my way to the back bedroom. As I approached the bedroom I began to hear the sounds -- sounds that left no doubt as to what was going on in that room. I just hoped the neither one of them was facing the doorway. I wanted to get several shots before they knew I was there and pulled apart. I stopped when I got to the door and double checked that I had the camera set on 'auto-focus' and then I quickly stepped into the doorway and began shooting. The two of them were caught by surprise and I got five shots before they separated. Leslie looked up at me in shocked surprise at seeing me home early and with the camera in my hand. 

 "All right Leslie; just what is the meaning of this?" 

 "Just having a little snack before I fix dinner." 

 Marge looked up at me from the bed and said, "How about you Rob? You want to do a little munching before dinner?" 

 I set down the camera and started taking off my clothes as I said, "Don't mind if I do." Report_Story
