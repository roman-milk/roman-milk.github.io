-------------------------------------------- 

My heart raced at the sound of His approaching footsteps as they resonated down the hardwood hallway to our bedroom. I waited as instructed, naked and kneeling on the floor in my usual greeting position: forehead to the floor, with hands clasped behind my head, fingers interlocking. Most importantly, I faced away from the bedroom door with my rear raised high in the air, because my Master always said that my best feature should be the first thing to greet Him. 

This was a particularly special greeting, so I wanted it to be just as He wished. The six days that my Husband and Master had spent out of the country had left me longing desperately to see Him again, to smell Him and taste Him, and to enjoy His loving domination. I had been growing as His submissive for more than six months, and had come to crave the way absolute surrender to Him deeply touched my soul. Master had made it clear that His homecoming night would be another significant step in our D/s relationship. 

I was careful to quickly lift my elbows off the floor as soon as I heard His hand on the doorknob. An elbow infraction would certainly add to the punishment I already had in store for masturbating twice without permission while Master was away. Only another submissive could understand why I had admitted this to Him on the phone the night before. Deceit has no place in the life of the submissive – it destroys the trust in the relationship, and no D/s relationship survives the breakdown of trust. 

So, I waited all day for my punishment with a certain nervous excitement. I knew that whatever discipline He delivered would be just and appropriate and would only serve to strengthen my submission to Him, a goal which I sought after with persistent determination. I longed for nothing more than to surrender my entire being to Him and to be able to say with all sincerity, "There is nothing that I would not do for my Master." 

His scent filled the room immediately upon His entering, and a rush of relief overtook me. I felt suddenly at home again, as if I had been the one away. He stood behind me in silence as I waited for His greeting. Smack! Smack! One swat of His open palm fell upon each of my upturned cheeks. I knew this greeting well and had craved it all week. Though He often spanked me with a variety toys, both for pleasure and for punishment, only the intimacy of His bare hand would do for our traditional greeting. I had come to read His greetings as well as any wife can read a welcome home kiss. Today's blows were dealt in deepest love, carefully measured to leave the faint red impression of His fine hand upon my flesh; impressions that I was honored to bear. I was pleased not to sense anger in His greeting, for although I was due punishment, I needed first to feel His love, and my gentle Master was ever mindful of my needs. 

He walked slowly and silently around me several times as I continued kneeling in position, waiting patiently for the signal to assume my next position. No signal came. His footsteps stopped and I felt a cool piece of soft cloth, almost certainly silk, slide between my face and the floor. Master firmly secured the cloth over my eyes and tied it snugly behind my head. No!! I screamed inside my head. Not the blindfold. I've been dying to see you, please, Sir!! My heart sank at the realization that this was part of my punishment. Master's discipline was always delivered with the greatest skill and care, as evidenced by how He cut me so deeply without laying another hand on me. 

Then came my signal. Master wrapped His strong hand around the base of my long ponytail and abruptly tugged upwards. I rose up, with Master's assistance, until I was sitting on my heels, my back straight and my small, pert breasts jutting out proudly. With my fingers still clasped behind my head, Master pulled my head back by my hair until my face pointed up toward His. I felt the warmth of His face approaching mine, and I waited eagerly for a kiss that never came. He was teasing me. Not only was He denying me the sight of Him, He was also denying me the customary kiss that always followed my being raised to a seated position. This hurt me more than the blindfold, and He knew it. By His silence, He also denied me the pleasure of His sweet and commanding voice. I ached from so much deprivation. 

Master released my hair and continued circling me slowly. I waited anxiously for His voice. Even words of disapproval or anger would be better for me than the silence to which I was being subjected. I felt His eyes drink in my nakedness from all directions and took some comfort in the admiration I knew He felt for my body. It was, after all, His possession, and I worked hard at making it something for Him to treasure. 

I continued waiting in what we commonly called "second position." Normally a kiss signaled His permission for my movement to the more restful "third position," in which I would tilt my head back upright and place my hands, palms up, on my slightly spread thighs. It was only once in this position that I would be allowed to speak. The three-step sequential greeting ritual had been our scene-opening convention for some months now, and this departure from it was a rare exception that left me with intense uneasiness. 

I felt Master's hand on my hair again, and He tilted my head upright again. I assumed it was His intention that I move to third position without the kiss, but as soon as I started to move my hands to my lap, He grabbed them and twisted them around behind me, where He fastened them tightly into a double wrist cuff that held my wrists together in an "X" at my lower back. Immediately I heard the familiar jangling sound of the chain that held Master's favorite nipple clamps, which He skillfully applied to my nipples, as sensations of both pleasure and pain to begin coursing through my body. 

I was thoroughly enjoying His attention, so my heart sank when I heard Him walk away and back down the hallway. I knew through experience that He was giving my senses a chance to fully absorb the items He had so far applied to my body, allowing me to rise to a more submissive mindset in preparation for what was to come. In compliance with Master's unspoken wishes, I stilled my body and began to focus my mind fully on the implements of submission with which I had been adorned, to thereby push from my mind the selfish attitude that so consumed me at our initial greeting. 

I started with the blindfold and consciously yielded my eyesight to Him. In my mind I followed the path of the silky material as it made its way from each of my eyes, around the side of my head and finally forming the knot in back. I shook my head slightly from side to side, allowing the dangling ends to lightly brush my shoulders, sending a slight chill down my arms. I thought of how the loss of sight meant that Master would have to guide my every movement and how completely under His control that placed me. I thought of how my trust in Him had grown since beginning down the path of D/s. 

My next point of focus was the wrist cuffs, which Master had crafted with His own hands. I appreciated the care He'd given to each detail, lining the leather with felt to make it smooth to my skin, even upon extended wearing. He cleverly designed in Velcro attachment straps that allowed the cuffs to be applied and removed quickly, but from which I was completely unable to escape on my own. I thought of how lucky I was to have a Master who was so good with His hands – at more than just leather craft too. I smiled at the thought. 

Finally my thoughts shifted to the nipple clamps. I recalled how Master had often commented that my nipples were made for clamping, and how I never really understood what He meant by that. Master never caused me to feel badly about my B cup breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty. He always made sure that I displayed them proudly for Him by having me sit up straight, with my chest thrust forward when in His presence. I was no pain slut, and although our D/ s relationship had been limited in the amount pain play we employed, these clamps were a common part of our repertoire. I had come to enjoy wearing them as much as Master enjoyed seeing me in them. He not only loved how they looked on me, but He enjoyed their versatility as an implement either of pleasure or discipline. Today's clamping was adjusted precisely in between the two, which was an unrecognized signal to me of what was to come. 

Master returned just as I completed my mental rounds, and I was once again amazed at His impeccable timing. I was still kneeling with my wrists bound behind me, but in my dreamy contemplation, I had allowed my shoulders to become slightly hunched forward. So, before Master could correct my posture, I quickly straightened my spine and pushed my clamped breasts out fully, as I knew He would desire. I hoped to elicit a response from Him, noting the obedience of my posture or otherwise expressing His approval of my appearance, but instead He walked right past me and entered the large walk-in closet at the far end of our bedroom, our toy closet. I strained my ears in an attempt to decode the sounds, eager for a clue about my pending punishment. 

The only clue I gained was from the sound of Master wrestling "The Saddle" from the back of the closet. At once my pussy flooded with expectancy and my heart pounded with fear. It had been a month since Master had completed this, His latest creation, but He insisted that the right opportunity hadn't yet presented itself for my initiation to The Saddle. I supposed that my punishment provided that opportunity. 

The first time Master showed me The Saddle, I was impressed with His creativity and craftsmanship, but more than a little intimidated by the sight of the thing. It consisted of a wooden base, approximately 24 inches wide and 36 inches long, covered in carpeting. Upon the base rested the platform, or "seat" over which the occupant was to kneel. The top of the platform was rounded over, roughly in the shape of a traditional saddle (hence the name), and covered in smooth black leather. There were two strategically placed openings at the apex of the platform, which Master explained could optionally be fitted with a variety of "probes," and a small leather "horn" in front, obviously intended for clitoral stimulation. On either side of the seat were foam pads, intended for the knees of the occupant. There were a number of cleats and rings to provide a multitude of bondage options for the "rider." A short cable extended from the platform a control box containing an array of knobs and switches, which Master did not bother to explain to me in detail. 

It was a marvel to behold, and I pouted for days for Master to let me try it out, until He finally assured me that begging would only delay my initiation to The Saddle. So I let it go, though I did climb to the back of our closet several times to peek at the device, imagining as best I could what it would be like to finally ride it. 

The luxurious smell of new leather permeated my senses when Master placed The Saddle on the floor near where I knelt, and the anticipation grew almost unbearable. I could barely contain my excitement as my pussy muscles began spontaneously contracting, eagerly seeking to be filled by The Saddle's probes. Master, on the other hand, was in no hurry – there were lessons to be taught first. I suppose inside I knew that Master's discipline always included a discussion of the infraction, but my body was aching for immediate stimulation. 

"Crawl to me, my horny little cum-craving wife," came Master's first words to me. His tone was playful yet insistent. 

"Yes, Master," I answered and began awkwardly shuffling on my knees toward the sound of His voice. "Where are you, Sir? Talk to me Master, and I will come to you." 

"I am here," He said repeatedly. 

Blindfolded and hands bound behind me, I had only my knees and head to feel my way to my Master. Each time He beckoned me I would adjust my path in the direction of His voice. It was a humiliating and frustrating five minutes I spent making my way to Him. I was convinced, though He assured me otherwise, that He was constantly moving around. In my search, I bumped into a wall, a door and a nightstand, before finally brushing my head against His knee where He sat in the loveseat of the sitting room adjacent to our bedroom. I scooted in between His feet and lay my head upon His knee. I felt I was in heaven to be at the feet of my Master after so many days apart. He reached down and softly stroked my hair for several minutes before finally speaking. His tone was formal, as a teacher would use to instruct a pupil. 

"It is the voice of your Master that leads you, my dream." I always loved it when He called me by the sub name He had given me: dream. In giving me that name He said that I was His submissive dream come true. He continued. "When you follow as directed, you find what you seek. When you go your own way, you simply wander about aimlessly. When I give you instructions and guidelines it is for a purpose – for the purpose of growing and exploring your submission. You want to grow in your submission to Me, don't you?" 

I nodded my head against Master's knee, forgetting the rule that requires me to always answer Him out loud during a scene. He reminded me by tugging on my ponytail until I remembered and answered appropriately. "Yes, Master." 

"Here we have a good example, dream. You know why I require you to answer me out loud, don't you?" 

"Because truth becomes truer when given voice," I answered, recalling the many times Master had thus corrected my behavior in this manner. 

"And do you know why I prohibited you from masturbating during my absence this week?" 

I thought for a moment about how Master usually gave me specific instructions to masturbate (where, when, what toys, number of orgasms, etc.) with the goal of drawing out my sensuality and sexuality. I wondered about this change in direction, but it's meaning was lost on me. So I simply pleaded, "Teach me, Sir" 

"You know how you rarely masturbated before we began this journey together – how you were chained to your antiquated taboos. Then I began to train you to listen to your body, to enjoy the way it was created for pleasure, to let yourself go and allow your sexuality to thrive. You have grown so much in this area. Haven't you been enjoying this new freedom of self-pleasure?" 

"Yes, Master," I blushed under my blindfold. Despite my increasing sexual freedom, talking about such things was still difficult for me. 

"So why would I turn around and deny you the very thing I had taught you to enjoy so?" He asked. 

"I don't know, Sir. I didn't really understand. I guess that's why I was so willing to go against Your instructions." 

"Not once, but twice," Master pointed out. 

"I'm sorry, Master," I answered. "I know I was a bad dream to go against Your wishes as I did. Twice." 

"On the surface the purpose of My instruction was simply to test your obedience. And you see how you failed at that, I'm sure. But more than that, you were to experience and appreciate the way your body now responds when you don't grant it the pleasures you have now become accustomed to. Not so long ago it made no difference to you, but tell me how it felt after the first four days of denial, just before you disobeyed me for the first time." 

"By the fourth day I was aching for release. I can't remember the last time I went four days without an orgasm, either from you or by myself. Then, when I read your email that night, where you painted such vivid and delightful pictures of your plans upon your return, it was like you lit a fuse inside me. It was only a matter of time before the explosion." 

"Tell me about the explosions, dream," He said, "Tell me all the details." 

"I sat at the computer reading your email in my short, green silk nightshirt. I felt myself getting wet by the time I read the second sentence - I was so stoked and had so much pent up sexual energy. By the time I finished your story my hand was involuntarily between my legs, spreading my lips and slipping my fingers inside. I must have read it three or four times – I lost count. I knew I was disobeying you, but I thought it was so unfair of you to send me such a stirring email and then not allow me to cum. I was completely out of control by that point, and I didn't care. By the end I had three fingers inside my pussy, bucking my hips as I plunged them in and out of me. My thumb was rubbing my clit as I teased myself toward the peak. My other hand was inside my nightshirt, pinching and tugging my nipples, just as the clamps in the story would have done. I came hard. I came really hard. I couldn't stop myself, Sir. I'm sorry." 

"And the second disobedience?" Master inquired. 

"It was the next morning. Your email scene was still playing clearly in my head. I woke up so incredibly horny and already wet. By that time I figured I had already violated your request, so I made no attempt to stop myself. I pulled my vibrator out of the nightstand and fucked myself silly. The cum wasn't as powerful as the night before, but it was still really good. I'm sorry I didn't respect your wishes." 

"So what have you learned – beyond the obvious fact that you need to be more obedient?" 

"You've turned me into a sex-crazed cum slut?" I asked, giggling, but only half-joking. 

"I didn't turn you into anything. You have always been a sex-crazed cum slut, really." Master laughed with me. "All I did was help you discover the truth about yourself – that your body was made for pleasure. In fact it needs pleasure to be fulfilled." 

"Yes, Master, and I'm feeling very needy right now – in need of some ful-FILL- ment." I sat up and smiled in Master's direction. If He could have seen my eyes, He would have seen how retelling my masturbation experiences had ignited a fire that burned white-hot inside me. 

"And the other thing you must remember, my dream, is that ultimately your body belongs to me. When I give you an instruction concerning its use, that instruction is to be followed, regardless of your own selfish desires." 

Master rose, lifted me to my feet with His strong arms, and pronounced, as He guided me across the room, "And now for a little something to remind you that next time I give you instructions they are to be followed." He suddenly stopped us our in his tracks and wrapped his strong arms around me from behind, tugging gently on the chain clamped so deliciously to my nipples. "And to remind you that your body is Mine, and therefore fully under My control." 

"The Saddle, Sir?" I squawked giddily. He didn't answer, but I knew it to be so, regardless. 

Master forced me to my knees, and I could hear Him fiddling with The Saddle. My mind began to race and my cunt muscles twitched with eager excitement. I couldn't wait to experience Master's incredible creation. When He had everything prepared, He freed me from the wrist cuffs and instructed me to assume the resting position to receive my instructions. 

"This is your Saddle, dream. I crafted it precisely to fit your beautiful body, and with it I will take total possession of your body. I can use it to give as much pleasure as I wish. But much as the clamps that now hold tight to your nipples, I can also use it to drive you beyond the edge of pleasure into the realm of pain. Tonight you will ride that sweet edge." 

"As you desire, Master," I replied sincerely. "My body is yours - take me wherever you want. I am ready to ride." 

"Explore the saddle with your hands first. Understand what it offers you before you mount it."  

===

I slowly ran my hands along the floor until they reached the carpeted base of The Saddle. I found the kneepad on the side nearest me, and moved past it, slowly tracing my fingers up the gentle arch, over the smooth leather, to the peak. I eagerly sought to feel the probes that would soon fill me – probes that I had never actually seen fitted into The Saddle. Both hands ambled over the surface of the seat until, almost simultaneously, they discovered the location of two protrusions, noting the stark contrast between their latex material and the leather seat. 

My pussy convulsed in spasms as I formed both hands around the base of the larger of the two shafts. Its size was actually a bit of a disappointment – I had taken much larger dildos than this, and I doubted that this could be the source of the pain Master spoke of. After stroking the shaft of the pussy probe several times, I moved both my hands to the smaller "rear" probe. Again, the size was less than intimidating – about the same as the medium plug in Master's anal accessory kit. No problem, I thought. 

Master squirted a generous blob of lube into each of my palms. "Prepare The Saddle for mounting," He ordered. Obediently, I spread the slippery substance over the phallic poles that would soon be inside me. My body ached for them to fill me as my hands stroked each of them up and down slowly and deliberately. 

"I want you to stop now and feel the depth of your need," He insisted, reading the lust on my face and the passion in my motions. "Let desire overtake you. Let your natural cum-slut self rise proudly to the surface." 

I resumed my resting position and sat very still, imagining, anticipating, wondering, and wanting. My entire being was becoming obsessed with the need to have my ass and pussy filled by Master's Saddle. 

"I am your cum-slut, Master," I said boldly. 

"Who has led you to find your true cum-slut self?" He asked. 

"You, Sir, You have taught me what I am and what I truly have always been. I am dream. I am your cum-slut." 

"Mount The Saddle, and surrender your body to Me." 

I crawled up on the platform and swung one leg over the seat, quickly mounting the machine like a dog in heat. I impatiently lowered my body onto the waiting slippery shafts, guiding them easily in with one hand on each until my ass came to rest against the soft leather beneath me. Gawd it felt wonderful, and I grunted out a loud, gasping moan. I loved the feeling of being filled front and back, and Master knew it. My body twitched and trembled and pleasure coursed through my veins, as I alternately clinched my pussy and ass muscles, surrendering them to my Master and His creation. What a delightful feeling! 

"Now fuck," Master insisted. 

On command I slowly began to rock my hips, humping and grinding my clit against the leather horn in front of me. With each thrust forward, my ass was filled deeper, and the front cock slipped out ever so slightly. My hips would then pendulum back, and as my cunt lips once again spread fully around the base of the front cock, the ass probe slipped out slightly. After only a few minutes of fucking, I felt myself vaulting toward orgasm at an astonishing rate, as my motions became almost violent. 

Master, who reads my impending orgasms with amazing acuity, suddenly yanked firmly on my ponytail. "Give me your attention, my little cum slut, and listen well. No cumming without permission. This time I mean it. You don't want to compound your punishment by failing to control yourself again, believe me." 

"Yes, Master," I replied, panting heavily, "I believe you." 

"Now be perfectly still," He ordered. I strained against every instinct my body had to keep fucking and bucking like a wild woman and forced myself to remain still. I placed my hands, palms up, on the tops of my slightly trembling thighs and waited for my next instruction. Even sitting motionless, I was still dangling on the edge of orgasmic explosion, and I could have easily cum instantly on Master's command. 

"Who owns the desire you feel now?" Master asked. 

"You, Master." 

"Who owns the release your body so desperately seeks?" 

"You, Master" 

"You have chosen to surrender your body and your pleasure to me, because I am here to take possession of them. You will learn, in time, to surrender these to me even when I am nowhere around – even when I am on another continent." 

"I desire to learn these things, Sir," I responded sincerely. 

"Gradually your submission will be made complete. Today's lessons will help you on the journey toward total submission." My heart leapt with delight at His words. 

Master bound my wrists behind me once again. He then tightened both nipple clamps several turns, causing me to wince and squirm as the pressure grew just out of the pleasure range. I'm quite certain Master smiled at my reaction. He then connected the chain than hung between the clamps to The Saddle in a manner that stretched my tits down taut. My shoulders slumped forward to slightly relieve the pressure, but Master pulled my back up straight by tugging at my hair. 

"Straight, dream. You know how." 

Master released my hair and I continued to sit straight, despite the soft burn in my nipples. "Yes, Master, I know how." 

He continued. "Having your tits bound to The Saddle like this will prevent you from dismounting, should you lose your nerve," He explained. "Remember you still have your safe word if you need it." 

His statement confused me. Why would I lose my nerve over something as pleasurable as The Saddle? And why in the world would I need to use the safe word? Hmmmm. A mild wave of nervousness began to build in my stomach. 

"Now remember, dream, be still," Master reminded me. There was a click and immediately my ears filled with whirring and humming noises, while simultaneously The Saddle came to life beneath me, groaning with something I could best describe as a gentle rumble against my thighs and ass cheeks. My body jerked upward slightly in surprise, and instantly the sting in my nipples brought me back down firmly in the seat. 

Nervously I focused every one of my available senses as sharply as I could, hoping to anticipate what would come next. Something in the base of The Saddle clicked, and I felt the pussy probe jump inside me. It potentially could have been a good sensation, but I was so on edge that I could scarcely enjoy it. Click. It jumped again, only this time I sensed the thing pressing harder against my walls. Click. Its growing, I thought, the damn thing is growing. Click. I felt my vaginal walls stretch to accommodate the expanding member. I instinctively rocked my hips in a fucking motion and found the shaft much more rigid than it had been at first. Master sternly reminded me to be still. 

With the next click, the swelling appendage hit my g-spot, and a rush of pleasure shot up from the depths of my womanhood, racing through me until I thought that surely I would cum, though not moving a muscle. 

"I'm going to cum, Master," I blurted out. 

"No you're not!" He replied sternly. 

"Please, Sir," I begged. "I need..." 

"Your need is not the issues, slut," He barked. "You have said I own your pleasure and your impending release. Now show me that it is so." 

I wanted to beg more, but knew it was futile. Everything in me wanted to hump The Saddle furiously and finally accomplish what my body longed for. Yet, as much as this need overwhelmed me, I knew that my need for submission to Master was somehow greater. Ultimately it was not the threat of His punishment that allowed me to yield my orgasm to Him, but my desire to be totally His. 

Three or four more clicks came in rapid-fire succession, and the stretching shifted to my ass, causing an abrupt burning sensation, as my back hole was forced open. I cried out quietly, more from the strangeness of the feeling than from discomfort. I was no anal virgin and though I was embarrassed to admit it, one of the few women I knew that actually asked for anal sex. So, I reminded myself not fight the intrusion and coaxed myself to relax, knowing that this was the best way to enjoy having my ass raped. 

At last the clicking stopped. I was full, very full – teetering on the brink of pain. I took a few deep breaths and allowed my body to relax onto the swollen probes. I can do this, I thought, I can even like this. Against the dark backdrop of my blindfold, I painted the picture that Master was likely beholding of me, riding upon His creation, naked, bound, with holes stuffed and tits clamped. It was an extreme and erotic sight. I thought of how hard His cock would be seeing me like this. 

I had lost track of Master in the midst of all that was happening to me, but suddenly He was standing in front of me, and the hard cock I had just been imagining was pressing against my lips. I felt the drops of pre-cum smeared over them, and I knew that Master had been stroking His meat, forcing them to the surface of the head solely for my enjoyment. I licked off every delicious bit. 

Master grabbed the back of my hair and violently forced Himself into my eager mouth, sliding in deeply until His wonderful cockhead pressed against the back of my throat and His balls rested on my chin. There was nothing I loved more than the feeling of Master's stiffness against the back of my throat. I loved the way He would often fuck my face with wild abandon, taking full advantage of all my cocksucking acuity. 

"Ah, dream," Master sighed, "I love how you serve me with that amazing mouth of yours." 

I truly cherished every moment of giving Master the best oral pleasure I could. And He knew how hot it always made me to suck Him with my hands bound - how erotically vulnerable I would feel at the mercy of His powerful and perfect manhood. 

"Now you are a totally full little cum slut," Master growled. Master was right, of course. I had never had all my holes so crammed full before. "Now, fuck me with your mouth." 

As instructed, I began to draw my head back, slowly sliding Master between my moist lips, all the while swirling my tongue about furiously, a technique that always got a rave response. But as I moved back the clamps bit viciously at my nipples, as my breasts were wrenched downward, causing me to stop my withdrawal suddenly when my lips were only half way up His shaft. 

"Fuck me, dream," Master repeated. "All the way." 

I tried to alter my motion, moving more with my neck and less with my torso, but inevitably there came a sharp biting sensation each time my lips encountered the thick, round head of Master's manhood. Nonetheless, I found a motion and rhythm that satisfied Him, yet minimized the pain enough for me to focus on pleasuring Him with my best effort. I started out slowly and lightly, but gradually picked up the pace and increased the suction. Master always liked my mouth to be as wet as my pussy, and He sloshed in and out until drool drizzled down my chin and splashed onto my bound breasts. Master's loud groans conveyed His pleasure at my oral mastery. 

I was so extremely turned on by all this that I had to focus my entire being on Master's gorgeous cock in order to keep from cumming immediately. If I even paused to think about my fully stuffed pussy and ass, it would have been over the top for me. But Master flicked a switch on the remote that suddenly drew my attention back to the bulbous shaft in my ass that was now vibrating steadily. After just a few seconds, the vibration moved to my pussy. For several minutes I enjoyed this alternating pattern of pleasure, all the while continuing to fuck Master with my mouth. In my mind I tried desperately to run from the orgasm that was about to overtake me. I had never been held on the brink for so long, and it was maddening. 

As if He read my struggle, Master caused the clicking noises to again emanate from The Saddle, resuming the expansion of my holes. Simultaneously both holes were stretched far beyond the pleasurable fullness I had so far enjoyed. Damn it was tight. I could feel the probes pressing upon one another, their offsetting vibrations swirling beneath me as if having a life all their own. The pressure turned to discomfort and the discomfort to pain within three or four clicks. I felt as if I was being torn open from underneath. My head grew still as I focused myself on trying to relax against the intense intrusions. Master took over the fucking motion, stifling my whimpers with the tip of His rock-hard cock, and forcing my head back at the expense of my aching tits. 

My head was spinning at the cacophony of sensations going on all over my body, sensations too plentiful and too dissonant to comprehend rationally. I was totally consumed by them, as if drowning in a violent sea. I could not have spoken, even had my throat not been crammed as fully as my pussy and ass. And even if I could have eked out a few words, I would have not know whether to beg for permission to cum or to scream out the safe word. 

"It is as I promised, dream." Master said. To my over-stimulated body it was as if His words were playing in slow motion. "At My hand you are riding the fine edge between pleasure and pain. Feel yourself careening through the darkness toward both extremes at once. Surrender to the extremes. Feel the pleasure and the pain splitting you wide open, as they peel you apart before me, for these are the implements of your complete surrender." 

Using The Saddle as His able assistant, Master was playing my body like a fine instrument – no, like an entire erotic orchestra of fine instruments. My ass and pussy were stretched tighter than the strings of viola. The buzzing vibrators played harmoniously within me with the timbre of a bassoon. Master slid smoothly in and out of my mouth like the glissando of a jazzy trombone. My heart pounded in my chest with the steady percussive thumping of tympani. An arpeggio of pain and pleasure danced through my being, building in crescendo toward a yet unwritten finale'. 

Fear gripped me forcefully when I heard The Saddle click successively, until I realized that the pressure was steadily declining back to where it had been before Master started fucking my face. The burning sensations were still present, and probably would be for hours, but no longer did I want to cry out in pain. Master turned the vibrators up several notches, until little by little pleasure took back my body from pain. 

The tempo and force of Master's face-pounding thrusts quickened steadily, driving a steady stream of saliva to pour from my hot mouth over the front of my body. I knew He was growing close by the string of half-sentences He grunted out. "Oh gawd... That fucking mouth... uuuuhhh damn... one wet... hot... fuck..." 

I wanted desperately to go off with Him, and I felt my own pending orgasm beginning to well up from the depths of my being. I had nothing left to fight it off with. Master was propelling me toward the peak of pleasure, riding my body like a rocket, as I simultaneously rode His fucking machine. 

He managed to signal His permission by gasping out a single word. "Together!!" He shouted. At that He turned on the vibrator in the horn, causing it to dance marvelously against my clit, which had thus far been neglected. It was a welcome and uncontrollable ecstasy. Without conscious knowledge, I began writhing frantically upon The Saddle, and resumed fucking Master with my mouth, meeting each thrust with full force, despite the periodic tugging against my breasts. I heard Him toss the remote control to the floor and then felt both His hands gripping the back of my head, as He drove His hard cock deeper than it had ever been. 

"Oh fuck, yeah," Master cried. "Ride that Saddle, dream! Fuck it good! Cum hard for me." 

Of course, I could not answer verbally, but I replied with my body, as I even more vigorously fucked the machine beneath me, rocking my hips desperately against it. The concurrent stimulation of my ass, cunt walls, g-spot, clit, and nipples, not to mention Master's delicious cock against the back of my throat, summed to a result that was both delightful and dizzying. A symphony of buzzing, sloshing, and groaning noises reverberated through the room as we both vaulted violently upward toward our mutual zenith. 

Master exploded first, forcing the first jets of His wonderful liquid love directly down my throat. I swallowed eagerly, gladly devouring every bit of the slippery offering that I could suck from His manhood. Within a few spurts, Master grabbed my hair and withdrew from my mouth. He held my head still by the hair in one hand and aimed His cock at my face with the other, as He bathed my lips, cheek and chin with successive beads of warm white cream. 

The feeling of Masters cum dripping from my face was all it took to initiate explosions of my own. Wave after wave rocked my entire body. I shook violently and screamed loudly, finally having my mouth free to express my pleasure, "Oh my gawd, Master, oh, oh, oh, oooooohhhh!" 

My body was still trembling with wonderful jolts of pleasure when Master silenced my screams with his dripping cock, stuffing himself into my mouth, allowing me to savor the last bits of his sweet come. I sucked and licked with abandon, until I finally had to pause to beg Him to turn off the machine. Thankfully, He obliged. 

As the latex members withered inside me, Master unleashed my nipples, swiftly extracted me from the machine, and carried me to the bed. I lay there in an exhausted heap as He freed me from my wrist cuffs and blindfold. 

At last able to see the man of my dreams, I gathered enough strength to throw my arms around Master for the first time in a week, and I think perhaps that was the best feeling of the entire night. Report_Story
