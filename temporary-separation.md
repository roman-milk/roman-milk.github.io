Temporary Separation
====================
#1 

 

 

===

My wife of ten years walked into the living room and handed me a glass of my favorite wine. This wasn't unusual. She tended to spoil me. Not a lot, but just enough for me to notice and make me spoil her. She had a serious look on her face that got me to wondering what was up. I had a bad feeling that I wouldn't like it. 

 "Honey, we need to talk." 

 The classic phrase that strikes terror into the hearts of mortal husbands. 

 "Sure, Babe. What's on your mind." 

 "Before I tell you I want you to remember how much I love you. You're the best husband in the world." 

 "I love you too, Babe." 

 "I want a temporary separation." 

 "Huh? Temporary separation? What ever for?" 

 I was stalling, trying to get my mind around what she had just said. 

 "I have some issues I need to work out in my mind. I think I could do it better if we were apart for a while." 

 Stalling again I asked, "For how long? I don't like the idea of us being apart." 

 "I know, dear. But it won't be for very long. Maybe just a few months." 

 "Is this open for discussion or it is settled without my input?" 

 "We can talk about it, but it's what I want. I really need this." 

 "I need some time to get my mind around this. You came at me all of a sudden. I'm not sure what to say. Can we talk again tomorrow night?" 

 "Of course we can, Honey." 

 With that said she threw her arms around my neck and gave the hottest kiss I had gotten in years. Her tongue was going after my tonsils and her hand moved down and she was rubbing my cock. Before I knew it she had it out and deep in her throat. She gave me a world class blow job taking my entire load down her throat. I hadn't had treatment like this in years. 

 Then it hit me like a freight train. She wanted to fuck someone else. Being a good poker player I looked at her without giving her a tell. She was smiling and licking her lips. 

 "Come to bed. I have some more plans for that beautiful cock of yours." 

 It quickly came to me that this might be the last time I would get to enjoy her beautiful body. I decided to go for it. I stood up and pulled her off the sofa. I quickly removed her clothes and picked her up. One hand went under her crotch and the other behind her back. I literally picked her up by her pussy. She squealed and I carried her and dropped her on the bed. I yanked off my shirt and dropped my boxers. 

 I fell between her legs and attacked her pussy. She was so turned on that she came almost immediately. I made her cum twice and flipped her over on her stomach. I grabbed her hips and lifted her into the classic doggie position. I took her in one stroke. She came again as soon as my pelvic bone hit her ass. I rode her like a two dollar whore. I pulled on her tits till she cried out. I grabbed her by her hair and pulled her back on my cock. I slammed hard in and out of her dripping cunt. She came two times before I dumped my load in her. I fell on her back, exhausted. She was mewing and moaning from all the orgasms she had. I reached over and turned the light off and pulled the covers up over us. She snuggled up to me with her back to me. She started to say something. 

 "Shhhh. Go to sleep. We can talk tomorrow." 

 She wiggled back against me and soon her breathing evened out and I knew she was asleep. I was wide awake. 

 I started trying to figure out what the fuck was going on. I figured tonight was a good bye fuck. She was probably leaving tomorrow after we talked. Next I tried to figure what brought it on. 

 We met in college like most of our friends. We were both sophomores at the time. She was taking business classes and I was going for a degree in mechanical engineering. We were exclusive from day one. I had a few romances before we met, but she was a virgin. I was careful with her the first few times and she took to fucking like a duck took to water. One thing I learned early was to give the woman the freedom to express herself sexually. She did. 

 It soon came to me that I was the only guy she ever fucked. Now she wanted to see what it was like with someone else. This had to be what was on her mind. I knew it wasn't anything lacking in our marriage. We had a great sex life. We made love at least four times a week and threw some extras in on the weekends. She was always very loving and had two or three orgasms every time. I also knew it wasn't due to me having a small cock. Mine was an honest seven inches long and above average in thickness. Only a size queen would want more. 

 I wasn't a workaholic either. I seldom had to work overtime. She sold real estate and her job was either feast or famine. We both had plenty of time for each other. It was simple. We loved each other and planned on growing old together. 

 If she had some legitimate issues she needed to work out that was fine with me. But I was a guy who took my marriage vows seriously. No fucking way I would let her go fuck someone else and take her back. I decided to play it cool and see what happened. Plans for my single life would go on hold for now. We weren't done yet; just on life support. 

 The next morning I woke before her. I got ready for work and stood looking at her. She looked peaceful laying there. I suspect she went to sleep knowing she had everything under control. Little did she know that the success of our marriage was in her hands. 

 I stopped at a doughnut shop on the way and got a maple bar and a cup of coffee. When I got to work I buzzed my boss. I needed to tell him what was going on. I suspected I would be needing some days off. 

 I was lucky in a sense. My boss and I were both poker players. We had spent many a night playing at the local Indian Casinos. After telling him what was going on he assured me I could take all the time off I needed. Just be sure to let him know. 

 I did manage to get a little work done that day. I think the boss told the people that worked under me to bring their problems to him. I kept running all the bullshit through my mind. I was amazed that she really thought I would just roll over and let her go off like this. I got to thinking if someone at work was making a move on her. I had met most of her coworkers. He boss was off the list. He was fat and fifty and happily married. No way a woman as hot as Sarah would go for him. There was one other guy that worked there. I had only met him once and an office party. He was the typical salesman. Brash, aggressive and so full of shit his eyes were brown. 

 Five o'clock rolled around and it was time. I couldn't avoid going home. I had a bad hand but I had to play it out. I pulled into the driveway and put on my poker face. 

 The first thing I saw when I walked in was two suitcases and a garment bag in the entryway. That meant that there would be no discussion. She was packed and ready to go. I dropped my briefcase and walked into the kitchen. 

 "Hi, honey. How was your day?" 

 The standard coming home from work greeting. 

 "It was OK. More of the same. Putting out fires. How was yours?" 

 "I showed a couple of listings. No bites. Just a couple of tire kickers." 

 "Gotta love the tire kickers for wasting your time." 

 "Dinner is almost ready. Go get your shower and relax. I'll call you when it's ready." 

 I walked toward the bedroom. I glanced at the dinning room table. She was going all in. Candles, good china and a bottle of wine. Tears welled up in my eyes. 

 I took a quick shower and sat in front of the TV. I put the news on and she brought me a glass of wine. 

 "Ten minutes." 

 I took a couple of sips of wine and got up and sat at the table. She started bringing in the food. Dish after dish of my favorites appeared on the table. 

 "I see you're all packed. Where will you be staying?" 

 "Marcie is letting me stay with her." 

 "Oh, that's nice of her." 

 Marcie, the three time loser. Two of her husbands caught her cheating. The last one just got tired of her bullshit and walked away. She has had more cocks in her than a nurse sees in an entire career. Now I knew who she had been talking to. She planted the seed about finding a strange cock. It was all clear now. She was using Marcie logic. She could fuck someone with out any guilt because we were separated. She could come back with a clean slate. 

 We chatted about nothing for the rest of the meal. She got up and cleared the table. All the dishes went in the dishwasher and it was time for her to go. 

 "I have to go now, honey. You know I love you. This will just be for a little while. I'll get my mind right and come back. Then I'll be the best wife in the world." 

 "I'll be fine, Babe. I know you love me. I'll miss you but I'll be fine. 

 With that she got up. She kissed me on the cheek, picked up her bags and loaded them in the car. She gave me one last hug and a kiss and I watched her drive away. 

 I sat on the sofa trying to figure what would happen next. I drew a blank. I knew I was fucked. If I told her not to go I would spend the rest of our marriage wondering if and when she was fucking someone. The was it was now I would find out for sure. I could only hope she would come to her senses and come back without fucking someone. Impotent rage swept over me. I screamed and screamed. Then the tears fell. The fear of losing her filled me. I finally cried myself out and shuffled into the bedroom. I looked around and saw the partially empty closet. I looked like she just took her work dresses. I looked in the chest of drawers and saw all of her lingerie was gone. Even the sexy Victoria Secret ones I bought her. He jewelry box and all of her make up stuff was gone. I turned on the TV and got in bed. About two hours later I managed to fall asleep. 

 The next morning I managed to haul myself out of bed and go to work. John saw me come in and walked into my office. 

 "How did it go, Eric? Did she leave?" 

 'Yep. She had her bags packed and ready to go. She fixed my favorites for dinner, kissed me and left." 

 "Do you need some time off? I can handle your business for a while." 

 "No, I need something to do. I don't want to just sit around feeling sorry for myself." 

 "Yeah, I hear that. Let me know if there is anything I can do. I'm here for you.' 

 'Thanks, John. I know you are." 

 I finished out the week as best as I could. I suspect the word got around what was going on. I got a lot of sympathetic looks from everyone. I got some nice smiles from some of the secretaries. I figured some were hoping for a shot at me. 

 Friday night I started planning. I would wait on separating our finances. I would do that after I found our if she was fucking someone. I needed to find out the address of the dip shit at work. I suspected he would make a move on her as soon as he found out she moved out. I went in the den and turned on our home PC. I searched for the real estate company home page she worked for. I found the one she worked at. There was his mug, a big shit eating grin on his face. I got his name and searched and got his address. 

 I checked my email. It was just some advertising and other bullshit. I tried to open Sarah's. It was password protected. I tired some combinations and finally hit it. It was her maiden name with our anniversary date. For an hour I looked around. I didn't fine anything at all. She may have deleted all the hot ones. I opened the Netflix home page and subscribed. I confirmed it from the email they sent. 

 I made a sandwich and got a beer. I kicked back and watched the beginning of a Star Trek marathon. I woke up at three and went to bed. 

 Saturday morning I went shopping. I went to a spy store. I told the guy what I had planned. He put me on to a pair of glasses. They had a clear lens with a camera and microphone built in. They just looked like any pair of dark horn rimmed glasses. He assured me they worked good in low light. He showed me a GPS tracker that had a range of five miles. It took a nine volt battery. Eight hundred dollars later I walked out. I stopped off at a men's store and bought a nice looking fedora. With the hat and the glasses I figured I had a pretty good disguise. 

 I got home and played with the glasses. They were pretty easy to operate. Just click a button on the ear piece and they started recording. The guy was right. They worked good in low light. I loaded the GPS AP on my phone and tested it. A map popped up and showed it was at my address. 

 Next I called a car rental and ordered a gray Honda. They agreed to deliver it. All I needed to do now was plant the GPS gadget on Sarah's car. I ate some lunch and kept busy the rest of the day doing yard work. 

 That evening I decided to forgo the Star Trek marathon and I went to the casino. I ate at the buffet and bought in a five ten pot limit holdem game. Over the next three hours I managed to win about three hundred dollars. 

 On he way home I drove my Marcie's house. I saw Marcie's car was gone and the house was dark. Sarah's car was there. I suspected they were out on the town. I parked down the block and walked back to Sarah's car. I looked around and saw no one. I put the GPS thingy under the fender. I got back in my car and pulled around the block to check to see if it worked. Just like the man said, it showed the map with Marcie's address. 

 I went home and watched some more of the Star Trek marathon. 

 Wednesday night I decided to check on Sarah. I didn't think Marcie would let much time go by before breaking Sarah into the singles scene. I got near her house and checked the GPS. Sarah's car wasn't there. I drove around to some of the close night spots. I suspected they would be at some place with a live band and dancing. Sure enough, at the third place I checked I found her car. I pulled in the parking lot and put on my glasses and hat. The guy at the door wanted a five dollar cover charge. While I was paying him I scanned the room. I saw them at a table for two in the back. I took a seat at the bar so I could see them in the mirror. I ordered a Bud Light and settled in for a while. 

 The stag line kept them pretty busy, but it didn't look like anyone was getting any action. About an hour later they got up and left. I had my back to them as they walked out. I followed a few minutes later. I followed them a few miles behind. The went back to Marcie's house. I decided to wait till Saturday night to go again. 

 Saturday night I was parked in on the other side of the block in my rental watching my phone. Sure enough, her car was moving. I pulled out and drove by Marcie's house. I saw there were lights on in the house. The last time they both went our the house was dark. 

 I followed her to the same night club. She went in and I followed about ten minutes later. As I paid the cover I saw her and asshole sitting at a table by the dance floor. I took my spot at the bar and clicked the button on my glasses. The got their drinks and he pulled her up to dance. It was a slow one and he pulled her close. My stomach tightened up and I tasted bile in my mouth. The stayed on the floor for three songs. When that sat down he leaned over and kissed her. She didn't pull back. The danced two more songs and sat down again. This time he kissed her again. Her hand went up and she caressed his cheek. Her hand went around to the back of his head and she ran her fingers through his hair. I could see their tongues were working out. I did some deep breathing to keep from rushing him and kicking his ass. I had to maintain my cool. An hour later they got up and left. I followed them out. They were standing by her car and were kissing again. Both of her arms were around his neck. I almost barfed on my steering wheel. I couldn't watch any more. I pulled out of the lot and parked. Soon her car was moving. I followed her to Marcie's house. I parked and waited a while. He didn't show up. 

 I sat on the sofa as the impotent rage consumed me again. I screamed and swore at Sarah. I knew it was just a matter of time before she fucked him. 

 I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep so I downloaded the video to my laptop. I ran it to where she was caressing his cheek and captured that one frame. I bumped it to where she had her fingers in his hair and did the same. I put them in my photo program and enhanced and cropped both of them. Those glasses were pretty good. It clearly shows the hot kiss. I named them asshole1 and asshole2 and saved them in my pictures folder. 

 I got in bed and watched TV till I finally fell asleep. 

 I spent a miserable Sunday trying to stay busy. I did a lot of yard work and that evening I played some poker. I managed to lose two hundred dollars. 

 Monday I showed up for work. John took one look at me and shook his head. 

 "You look like shit. Did it happen?" 

 "I don't think so. She went out with that asshole from work. He was working on her big time. I think it's just a matter of time." 

 "I'm sorry for you, buddy. Hang in there and you'll get through this. It will get easier." 

 I didn't get much work done so I took off Friday afternoon. I contacted my lawyer and had him prepare the divorce papers. We went over the nuts and bolts of it. We didn't have any kids so it would be a fifty fifty split. I didn't want the house so she could buy me out or we could sell it. I instructed him to hold them till I called. 

 I had to wait till she fucked him so I didn't go to the bank yet. I didn't want to tip my hand. 

 That night I decided to check on Sarah. Maybe she planned on doing the weekend with him. I parked in my usual place and waited. I watched my phone and at eight her car started moving. I had my disguise ready and my camera also. I figured tonight was the night. I followed her to the same club. I waited till she went in. I put on my hat and glasses and went in. I say them sitting by the dance floor. This time Marcie was with her and she had a guy with her. Asshole was with Sarah. I clicked my glasses and started recording. I noticed that asshole was all over Sarah. He was holding her hand on the table. When they danced his hands were on her ass. I tasted the bile again. Finally they got up and left. Marcie got in the car with her date and they left. Asshole pulled out and Sarah followed him. I hung back a little and followed. The went to his house. As I cruised by she pulled into his driveway. I didn't see them get out. I really didn't need to. 

 I drove around for about twenty minutes. I came back and parked across the street from his driveway. I needed a picture of her car there. I waited till the lights went out and pulled out. I aimed my headlights on the back of their cars. I quickly took three snapshots of both cars. I pulled away. I stopped and checked to see if I got a good picture. All three turned out just fine. 

 The impotent rage consumed me as I drove home. 

 I captured the shots of his hands on her ass and enhanced them. I downloaded the ones of her car and enhanced one of them. It had a time stamp on it. Her license plate showed clearly. I saved them with all the others. 

 I set my alarm for five and turned on the TV. 

 The next morning my alarm jolted we awake. I was dreaming of them fucking. I saw her naked under him with her legs wrapped around his ass. Her hips were thrusting up and his ass cheeks were clenching as he pumped his cum in her. I rushed to the bathroom and puked up green bile. The rage hit me again. 

 I got dressed and drove to his house. I took three snapshots of their cars and drove off. 

 I suffered through the rest of the day planning my single life. I had what I needed and I intended to use it. I loaded the pictures on my phone and prepared a text for her. 

 'I see you have your mind right and all your issues worked out. We had a great ten years. I hope your next ten are as good. Eric.' 

 I attached the pictures to it and saved it in drafts. 

 Monday morning I called John and took the day off. 

 First I went to the bank. I took half the savings and the value of our CD's and opened another account. I left the checking alone. I put three thousand in my new checking account. I stopped by my lawyers office and picked up Sarah's copy of the divorce papers. I contacted a process server and paid him his fee. I gave him an extra one hundred to help me with my plan on serving her. We set it up for Tuesday at nine in the morning.  

 

 

===

I looked around near the office for an apartment. I found one and signed a month to month rental agreement. I found a company called 'Two guys with a truck' and moved some of the furniture and kitchen stuff to my apartment. I loaded all my clothes and personal stuff in my car. I returned the rental car and had them drive me back to my car. I stayed busy the rest of the day getting my apartment ready to live in. 

 Tuesday morning I was parked in sight of Sarah's office. The process server was standing by. I saw Sarah drive up. I watched her walk in the front door and I called the server. 

 "She's there. Go ahead." 

 I saw him drive up and I sent the text I had ready and I drove away. I wished I could have been a fly on the wall. Fifteen minutes later my cell phone rang. I saw it was from Sarah. I let it go to voice mail. I drove back to my office. I gave John the thumbs up. He just smiled. He knew what my plan was. My phone rang again and I shut it off. I told the receptionist not to put any calls from Sarah through. Just take a message. 

 Two hours later I turned on my phone. There were seventeen calls in voice mail and five texts. I listened to the first one. She wanted to talk. I deleted the rest. The text's said the same thing. We need to talk and work through this. I deleted them. The receptionist brought me five message slips. They were all from Sarah. 

 I sent her a text. 

 'Please stop calling my office. I have nothing to say to you. You can contact me through my lawyer.' 

 I got two more calls from her that I let go to voice mail. Finally they stopped. 

 Two weeks later I was looking over the design plans for a machine that made paper clips. It looked pretty simple. I signed off for the shop to make a prototype. My cell phone rang and without thinking I answered. 

 "Hello.' 

 "Eric, it's Sarah. Please don't hang up." 

 "OK, Sarah. What do you want?" 

 "If you'll meet with me and let me talk, I'll sign the divorce papers. I just want you to hear me out." 

 "Yeah, I can do that. How about the Olive Garden on Main street. I'll be there at noon." 

 "Thank you, Eric. I'll see you there." 

 "Goodbye." 

 Fifteen minutes to twelve I grabbed the divorce papers and headed to The Olive Garden. I got a table in the back and waited. Right on time she showed up. She was dressed to impress me. It worked. Her beautiful naked body flashed in my mind. I put on my poker face as she sat down. 

 "Thank you for meeting with me, Eric. I want to find a way for us to get back together. I love you and I'll do anything you want. Please stop the divorce and give us a chance." 

 "I love you too, Sarah, but I don't think that's enough now. You broke trust. I could never trust you again. I would always be wondering if you're with another man while I'm away. I can't live like that." 

 "If you just give us a chance I'll show you that you can trust me. It may take a while but I know I can do it. I realize how stupid I was. I won't ever do it again. Please. I love you and I want you back in my life." 

 I pushed the papers in front of her an laid a pen on them. 

 "Sign them, Sarah. You have to realize we can't ever be together again. It just won't work. I have this video that runs through my mind. I see you with your legs around his ass and him pumping you full of his cum. It's going to take a long time before it's gone." 

 The tears started running as she signed the paper. 

 As I folded the papers and put them in the envelope I said, "I hope you and the asshole have a good life." 

 "Eric, I'm not seeing him now. He transferred to another office. I'm not seeing anyone." 

 "What about Marcie. She's the one came up with your crazy scheme." 

 "I have my own place now. I realize what she did and I'm not talking to her now." 

 "Now that you've signed these papers you're released from your marriage vows. You can fuck anyone you want." 

 "Please, Eric. Give us a chance." 

 "I can't do it Sarah. I'm sorry." 

 I picked up the papers and walked out. I heard her sobbing as I walked away. 

 I stopped off at my lawyers office on the way back. We talked about filing against the Real Estate company. They had franchises all over the west coast. We didn't know if they had a non fraternization policy or not. I had him file against them just in case. It would be worth five hundred dollars to find out. If they did I was going to collect big time. 

 He filed it and served them two days later. One week later I was sitting in my office. The receptionist buzzed me. 

 "Eric, Mr. Johnson is here. He is from ABC Real Estate." 

 "Thank you, Emily. Send him in." 

 He walked in and we shook hands. He sat and smiled. 

 "Mr. Johnson. What can I do for you?" 

 "We're prepared to make you an offer to stop the lawsuit." 

 "OK, what's you offer?" 

 He wrote an figure on a piece of paper and pushed it to me. It was for one hundred K. I smiled and crossed it our and wrote one million on it. I pushed it back to him. He looked at it and smiled. 

 "I'll be in touch. If the head office accepts this we will want you to sign a release of further claims and a non disclosure agreement." 

 "That won't be a problem." 

 "Good day, sir." 

 I smiled as he walked out. I knew they would pay up. The didn't want their name dirtied up in court. 

 A week later I got a check from Sarah. She refinanced the loan on the house and bought me out. I added another seventy five k to my net worth. Mr. Johnson finally showed up a with a check. They took my offer. I signed off and bid him farewell. I took the check and showed it to John. 

 "I hope you're not quitting. I need you here. It would be really hard to replace you." 

 "No. You're stuck with me for a while longer. I would go crazy doing nothing." 

 "Good. Now get back to work." 

 I chuckled and walked out. 

 Three months later my divorce was final. It felt like a great weight was lifted off my shoulders. I was a single man. Over the next six months I watched a lot of movies and played a lot of poker to fill my evenings. The anger and hurt had faded enough that I decided to start looking around for some pussy. I was getting tired of doing it myself. 

 I checked with John about a not frat clause in my contract. He laughed. 

 "You planning on fucking all the secretaries now." 

 "I doubt I'm man enough for that. That's a really big bite." 

 "Go for it. There's nothing in your contract to stop you. You might take a close look at Amy. The rumor is she has the hots for you." 

 I gave him a high five and left. I heard him laughing as I closed the door to his office. 

 I sat at my desk thinking about what John said. 

 'Amy, huh. She is definitely cute. Nice rack and outstanding legs.' 

 I picked up the phone and punches in her extension number. 

 "Hello, this is Amy." 

 "Hi, Amy. This is Eric." 

 "Hi, Eric. What can I do for you." 

 "Well, you can go to lunch with me. How does that sound." 

 "I like that idea. I'll see you at the front entrance at twelve sharp." 

 'Bye bye." 

 I could see her through my office window. She turned, looked at me and smiled. I guess John was right. 

 ****************** 

 On their third lunch date Amy and Eric are sitting in The Olive Garden. They just finished lunch are getting ready to go back to the office. 

 "Eric. I want to cook dinner for you Friday evening." 

 "Wow. That's a nice offer. It's been a long while since I had a home cooked dinner. What are you planning? I'll bring some wine." 

 "I make a mean lasagna. How about some red." 

 "A burgundy or a claret?" 

 "How about a nice claret?" 

 "Consider it done. Does about seven sound ok?" 

 'Perfect. Everything will be ready" 

 ******************* 

 I'm standing on her door step. I take a deep breath and ring the doorbell. She opens the door, standing there stark ass naked wearing a pair of red five inch heels. My mouth falls open and I almost drop the bottle of wine My eyes swept over her body. Her pussy is shaved clean and her little pink clit is peeking out at me. I remember to close the door. 

 "Oh my god, Amy." 

 "Do you like my outfit. I picked it out just for you." 

 "God, you're beautiful, Amy. Just beautiful." 

 "Thanks. A girl likes to hear nice things like that. But there's a problem." 

 "What's that?" 

 "You're way over dressed. Let me fix that.' 

 She takes the bottle of wine and sets it on the side table. Slowly she takes my clothes off. She looks me over just like I did with her, except my cock is half hard. 

 "Hmmm. Nice outfit, Eric. Did you pick that out just for me?" 

 "Yep. I hope you like it." 

 "You can bet on that. Come in the kitchen. You can decant the wine while I finish up." 

 I follow her in with my eyes on her hot ass. She takes a decanter from the cupboard and hands it to me. I manage to get the cork out and pour it. I sit at the table, watching her. She bent over and opened the oven. Her pussy and pink pucker is on view for me. I see that her pussy lips are moist. She hears my groan and giggled. 

 "Like the view there, big guy?" 

 "I could look at that all day." 

 She grabs two potholders and takes the lasagna out and sets it on the stove. She turns and smiles at me. 

 "While that's cooling a little let me do something." 

 She drops to her knees in front on me and lifts my cock. She leans over and kisses the head. I scoot out on the edge of the chair and lean back. She cups my balls and licks the head of my cock. Slowly her lips open and she captures the head. 

 "I want my appetizer now. You just sit there." 

 Slowly she takes all of my seven inches down her throat. My head falls back and I hear myself groan. She starts a rhythm sucking an licking while she fondles my balls. By now my cock feels like a bar of steel. In just a few minutes I feel a stirring in my loins. She takes it out and looks at me. 

 "Cum for me, baby. It's been so long since I tasted a good load of cum." 

 She throated me again and scratched the back side of my nut sack with her nails. That pushes me over the edge and my cock explodes in her mouth. I hear her whimper through her nose as she catches every drop. She stays on it till it goes limp. She sits back and smiles at me. Her head goes back, her eyes close and she swishes my cum around in her mouth. She moans and swallows twice. She shows me her empty mouth. 

 "Oh god that was good. Nothing better than a good load of cum juice. And yours tastes especially good. I'm gonna want lots more of that." 

 "Don't worry. Before the nights over you're going to get all I have." 

 She stands up and leans over in front of my face. She looks in my eyes and kisses me. My lips open and her tongue goes in. I get a hint of my cum. It's the first time and it isn't bad.' 

 "Do you like the taste of your cum?" 

 "It's not bad. I may have to eat a cream pie soon." 

 "Oh god. Yes. Yes. That will be amazing. But we need to eat first. You'll need your strength." 

 While we're eating she asks, "Shall we exchange war stories. Kinda get it out of the way?" 

 "We can if you want. Mine's kind of dull." 

 "Tell me about it." 

 "OK. One evening Sarah gave the the terrible line, "we need to talk." I knew something bad was coming. She wanted a temporary separation. It hit me that our marriage was probably over at that point. I just shined her on because she didn't ask. She said it like there would be no discussion. 

 "Anyway, the next night she left. All I could do was hope she came to her senses and came back. Of course she didn't. She fucked some guy she was working with. There was nothing left but the divorce. Oh, I almost forgot. I sued the company she worked for. They had a non fraternization clause in their contracts. I made a pretty good score from that. " 

 "Do you know why she did it?" 

 "I think so. She was a virgin when we met. I was her only. She wanted to see what another man was like. I saw her car at his house and filed two days later. All the rest is history." 

 "You OK now. No regrets." 

 "None. Now it's just like a bad memory. I've moved on." 

 "I've heard of women doing that. I guess she thought that it would be OK because you were separated." 

 'Yeah. But we were still married. She broke trust and that killed it for me." 

 "It's really hard to rebuild trust. Usually it can't be done." 

 "OK, now let's hear yours." 

 "Oh god. Mine is funny now. It wasn't at the time but I laugh now. I went to work one day and forgot my cell phone in the charger. I went back on my lunch break to get it. I found my husband in bed. He wasn't alone. This huge black guy with dreadlocks was fucking him in the ass. I was so shocked I just stood there. I never had a clue he was bi. Two days later I was gone." 

 "Holy crap. That is unreal. How long ago did it happen?" 

 "It's been two years. I'm over it now. I look back and just have a laugh." 

 She got up and started putting the kitchen back together. 

 "Can I help?" 

 "No, you just pour us another glass of wine. I'll just be a minute here." 

 She put the food away and loaded the dishwasher. Then she took me by the hand and let me to the bedroom. We sat leaning against the headboard sipping our wine. One of her hands was holding my cock. She was slowly getting it hard. 

 "Nice cock you have there. Just the perfect size. Not too big and not too small." 

 "You have some pretty nice stuff too. I like the shaved look. Blew my mind when I saw you." 

 "It makes me feel sexy. I like it." 

 We put our wine glasses on the table and I took her in my arms. Our lips met and our tongues found each other. We kissed for a while and I started working my way down toward her pussy. I stopped at her neck and then her breasts. She was mewing and holding my head. I left a trail of kisses to her shaved mound. She spread her legs for me and I moved into position to attack her pussy. He pussy was already wet and I licked up some of the juice. She grabbed her knees and pulled her legs wide for me. I licked her from her little pink pucker to her clit. One finger went in her as my tongue found it. She cried out as I touched it with the tip of my tongue touched it. One more finger went in her. I redoubled my licking and sucking on her lips. I held her clit hood up and touched it a few times. I curled up my fingers and found her G spot. I rubbed it and tongued her clit. She squealed and came on my face. 

 "Oh god yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't stop. Please don't stop." 

 I kept working on her G spot. She came three more times. I decided to give her a big one. I got her G spot going and sucked up her clit. I gently bit it and I heard her scream and an orgasm ripped through her. I though she was going to rip my ears off. I let her come down and bit her again. Her screams filled the room and she came again. She got too sensitive and pulled me up in her saddle. 

 "Holy fuck, Eric. What did you do to me? That was amazing." 

 "I thought you might like that. Just a little trick I learned in college." 

 "Like it? On a scale on one to ten that was a twenty. Wow." 

 "I'll make a note of that. Likes her clit bit." 

 "You fucker. I want you to fuck me now. I want it hard and then harder. I want you to fill my pussy with you hot cum." 

 "Yes, Maam." 

 I lifted and she grabbed my cock. She rubbed it around her soaked pussy lips and thrust up. The head popped in and she squealed. 

 "Yes. Yes. Big hard cock in my pussy. Give me all of it hard and fast." 

 I thrust down hard and my bone hit hers. She came again. I didn't show her any mercy. I started slowly and sped up till I was slamming into her. Her legs went around my ass and her arms went around my chest. 

 "Yes. Yes. Slam that cock in me. Fuck me. Fuck me. Harder and harder." 

 She came two more times and I couldn't hold back any longer. 

 "Take it, baby. Take my cum." 

 "Fuck yes. Fill me. Shoot that hot cum in me." 

 I slammed into her two more times and my cum rocketed into her grasping pussy. We both screamed as our orgasms took us. 

 I fell at her side but she kept a death grip on me. She was kissing my neck and face. I just held her close. 

 "Oh my god, Eric. That was amazing. Just like I wanted it. Hard and harder. I hope we didn't break anything." 

 "I don't think we did. Nothing hurts. In fact everything feels just right." 

 "That woman is crazy. I should call her and thank her for letting you go. You're in for it this weekend. I'm going to fuck you to death." 

 "I'll go for that. I haven't ever been fucked to death." 

 She finally got her breathing under control and moved down. She licked and sucked my cock clean. 

 "Wow. We really taste good." 

 She moved up and kissed me. she gave me some tongue with our juice on it. 

 'Yep. A cream pie is definitely on the menu. We need to add a little more cream to make it just right." 

 "Oh my god, yes. You can have all you want." 

 We stayed in each others arms enjoying the wonderful afterglow. She had my cock in her hand slowly stroking it. It started to fill with blood. She sped up and got it full hard. She moved up on my chest and slid down. My cock went slowly into her. 

 "Lay still, baby. I'm gonna love on you." 

 "I'll try." 

 She gave me a genuine slow fuck. I felt like it lasted an hour. She kept me from cumming by just going slow. I tried to lay still but I would flex my cock now and then. It made her cum. After forever she sped up and took my cum. She stayed on my chest and I felt tears drop on me. 

 'You OK, baby." 

 "Of course I'm OK. I'm just having a little emotional rush. Don't mind me. They're tears of joy." 

 I hugged her tight and stroked her hair. I head her sniff a few times. I tilted her head up and kissed her. I rolled her off me and my hand found her cum filled pussy. I got it all over my hand and rubbed it on the inside of her thighs. I got some more and rubbed up on her stomach. One more time and I rubbed it on her breasts and face. 

 "Eric. You just put cum juice all over me." 

 I didn't answer. I slowly moved down and spread her legs. I kissed her soppy pussy and gave it a lick. She squealed and I went to work. Two fingers in her pussy and licking her all over. She came once quickly. I kept going and took her to the peak. I bit her clit and she screamed and came hard. 

 "There ya go. One cream pie finished." 

 "Oh my god, Eric. That's a first for me. No one ever did that. No one ever took the time and cared enough to do it." 

 She pulled me against her and licked all the pussy juice off my face. 

 "You're an amazing lover, Eric. You make me cum so hard and so often. This is going to be the best weekend of my life." 

 "I just found you. I hope we have some more." 

 "I'll be here for you. You can bet on that." 

 An hour later she rode me cowgirl and we finally fell asleep. 

 I woke first the next morning. We were stuck together with all he cum juice I smeared on her. I had to peel us apart. She woke up and we hopped in the shower. I got her all lathered up and took her soap suds and all. Two screams echoed in the shower. 

 We had a naked breakfast and made up the bed with clean sheets. We laid around all day, fucking every time she got me hard. By Sunday after noon I was worn out. I couldn't have gotten hard if my life depended on it. I got dressed, kissed her goodbye and limped to my car. 

 I got home and my cell phone rang. She sent me a text. 

 "Everything hurts. Thank you." 

 I sent her one. 

 "The girls in the office will know." 

 She sent me a smiley face. 

 ******************** 

 Over the next few months we fucked as often as possible. We fucked in the parking lot during lunch. Once in the parking lot at the super market. One time we stayed late at work and I fucked her on her desk. 

 I decided to give up my apartment and I dipped in my lawsuit money. I bought a three bedroom condo. Of course we had to break in every room a number of times. 

 We both were reluctant to do anything permanent but we finally moved in together. She sold her house and moved into the condo. We stayed together for two years and finally broke down. We became best friends and very much in love. We had a quiet little ceremony at the court house.

I saw Sarah a few times but we never spoke. Later I heard through the grapevine that she transferred to another city. I didn't ask which one. I really didn't care. 

 Ten years later Amy and I are still madly in love and still trying to fuck each other to death. Report_Story
