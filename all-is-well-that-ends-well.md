All is Well That Ends Well
==========================

It has been said that "All is well that ends well" but who is it that determines what is "well"? A case in point: I find out that my wife is an unfaithful whore and I toss her out on her ass and I'm rid of her. It ended well for me right? Then how come I'm so fucking miserable? 

 It started six months ago when I married my secretary. Hillary was hired by my dick. The day she came in for her interview and walked into my office my brains shot right down into the head of my cock and it said, "You are hired" before we even said hello to each other. A tall woman, 5 feet 9 inches, and a body to die for (36-22-34 I found out later). She had the face of an angel and long blond hair that hung down to the middle of her back. When she sat down in front of me and crossed her incredibly long legs I only had one question I wanted to ask: "When can you start." 

 I did ask the other questions like how many words a minute she could type, how was her shorthand, and how familiar was she with the computer programs I mentioned. To this day I don't even remember her answers to those questions, but they didn't matter because I wasn't going to let her get away even if she couldn't do any of that stuff. Fortunately she turned out to be an excellent typist, could take dictation and was a whiz on the computer. Nine months later we were married and six months after I began to see and hear things that led me to believe that Hillary was not all that faithful to me. 

 +++++ 

 At first it was what I didn't hear. Guys would be standing around talking, but would shut up when I approached or they would see me coming and the group would quickly disperse. Once I entered the men's room and caught the tail end of a conversation that immediately stopped when I walked in. I only heard three words, "Is fucking Hillary," before Ron and Burt saw me, zipped up and left. 

 I started watching Hillary but I never saw anything out of line and I marked it all up to an overactive imagination. It wasn't until I wired the conference room that I actually heard something definite. I had several sub-groups working on various projects and they used the conference room for team meetings. I got tired of having them come to my office to get me to come to the conference room just to answer some pissy assed question so I decided to just put in an intercom system. If they needed my input they could just buzz me and I could answer their questions without having to leave my office. I put in the system and then ran several checks to make sure that it worked right. The last check was from the room to my office and it worked fine, but I forgot to turn it off when I left the room. 

 I was sitting in my office cleaning up some paperwork when Steve, Mike, Al and Joe came into the room. Mike asked where Bob was and Joe laughed. 

 "Where do you think he is? He's trying to line Hillary up for when Chuck goes out of town tomorrow." 

 No mistaking who they were talking about. I was the only Chuck working there (actually I owned the company) and I was the only one there who had a wife named Hillary and I was going out of town the next day on a two day business trip. 

 "Why aren't you trying?" Mike asked Joe. 

 "I did, but she said she wanted to try someone new." 

 Several laughs and then Al said, "That means I won't be getting any for a while." 

 "I wonder if Chuck gets any?" Mike said and Al laughed again and said, "When would she squeeze him in?" and they all laughed. 

 Just then Bob came into the room and asked what was so funny. 

 "We were just wondering if Chuck ever gets to fuck his wife." 

 "I don't know about Chuck, but I do know who is going to burying the bone in her tomorrow." 

 "You dog you" Al said. 

 "Get ready for some kinky" Steve chimed in. 

 "Kinky? What do you mean kinky?" 

 "She get s off on having your cock in her cunt or her ass while she's talking to Chuck on the phone." 

 "No shit?" 

 "No shit guy." 

 "You think Chuck knows?" 

 "I know for a fact that he doesn't. Hillary tells everyone she fucks to make damned sure that they never do anything that might let Chuck catch on. She says if she even gets a whiff he might be suspicious every one of us will be cut off for good. You'll get the speech tomorrow before she unzips your fly and she means it. So know this, you fuck it up for the rest of us and we will hunt you down and cut your dick off. Right guys?" 

 That was followed by all of them saying, "Fucking A" or "You bet your ass." 

 Then Mike said, "Okay guys, to business. What are we going to do about...." And at that point I turned off the intercom and took the tape out of the system recorder and put it in my briefcase. 

 +++++ 

 One of the things I'm not is stupid. I didn't sit there and moan, "Oh it can't be; she loves me, I just know she does." Denial is not part of my makeup. One guy and it could just be wishful thinking, but when five guys are talking about what they have already done you don't wring your hands and say there must be some mistake. 

 What burned me the most was that those same five guys were supposed to be my good friends. We went fishing together, took weekend trips to Vegas together and played poker at my house every other Friday. Some fucking friends! Then there was Hillary. What had happened there? How had the blush left the rose so fast? Could it be that she only married me for my money? Marry the owner of the company and be set for life? I didn't know and I didn't care to fine out. I would verify that it was true and then she wouldn't know what hit her. 

 +++++ 

 The next evening I called home from San Francisco at my usual time and when Hillary answered the phone she sounded a little out of breath. I wasn't paying close attention to what she was saying because I was straining to see if I could hear background noise. I thought I heard heavy breathing and I know I heard a 'squishy' sound. My bet is that it was being made by a cock driving into a very wet hole. Hillary and I made small talk for a couple of minutes and we each told the other that we loved them and then we hung up. I hoped Bob was enjoying himself; it would be a shame to go through what was going to happen to him and not have gotten something out of it. 

 When I got home Hillary was waiting for me dressed in my favorite outfit, a pair of 'come fuck me' pumps and nothing else. She asked me if I would like a drink or would I rather just hurry up to bed. Hillary was a fantastic piece of ass and I was going to miss her, but I was a realist and I knew that I didn't have to start missing her until she was actually gone so I dropped my briefcase on the floor and started undressing. It was a long night and she tried to fuck me to death and when I left for work the next morning I again thought of how much I was going to miss her. 

 +++++ 

 The Friday coming up was the regular night for our poker game. The reason the game was held at my house was simple - so I wouldn't have a problem getting home. I can not handle alcohol. I love to drink, I enjoy drinking and I have a good time when I drink right up to the point where I pass out. When that happens I'm dead to the world and nothing can wake me up. The way that it has always been is that we would meet at my house, play poker until I passed out and then my 'friends' would pick me up, lay me on the couch, finish out the hand and leave. 

 On poker nights Hillary, saying that she couldn't stand being around a bunch of loud-mouthed men, would leave and go shopping or take in a movie. Up until a week ago I had no reason to doubt that what she said she did is what she actually did, but now I wondered if she did any of those things. To me it stood to reason that if she got such a kick getting fucked while talking to me on the phone she would get an even bigger kick out of fucking them while I was right there in the room. 

 Thursday, while Hillary was at her standing afternoon hair appointment I went home and set up two remote controlled video cameras and put the remote controls under the seat cushions on the couch and then headed on back to work. 

 Friday at seven the guys began arriving and by seven-fifteen we were all sitting at the table ready to play. Hillary came into the room, kissed me and told me she would see me when I woke up in the morning and then she left to go to the movies. 

 "This is going to be a great night boys" I said, "I can feel it in my bones." I broke the seal on a new deck of cards and we cut for the deal. I pulled the ace of spades. "An omen boys, get your wallets out and get ready to contribute. House rules same as always. Three raises, no check and raise, five-dollar limit and dealers choice. I called five card draw, jacks or better to open and dealt the cards. I picked up my cards and looked at them and had to smile. I had three jacks and two junk cards. Al, to my left was the first bettor and he passed. Mike passed and Steve opened for a dollar. Joe raised a dollar and Bob folded. I smiled and said, "Yes indeed my men, my lucky night" and I raised five bucks. Al threw his hands in and every one else still in called. 

 Mike took one card so I knew he was trying for a flush or a straight. Steve took three so I knew he had a high pair. It was jacks or better to open and I had three jacks so he had to have queens, kings or aces. Joe took two which made him a difficult read. He could have three of a kind, but he had been known to hold a high pair with an ace kicker and then bluff up a storm. I took two and when I looked I saw that I had tossed in two junk cards just to make room for two more junk cards. Mike checked and Steve bet a dollar and Joe called which told me he hadn't gotten any help for his high pair. I raised five bucks, Mike and Steve folded and Joe called. I showed my three jacks and Joe tossed his hand in saying "shit!" I raked in the pot and chortled, "My night guys, no need to play, just hand me your money" 

 My usual drink was vodka tonic with a twist of lime and that is what it looked like I was drinking, but it was only water in my glass. I swigged my water down and when the glass got close to empty I got up and asked the guys if they were ready for refills and then I went and filled my glass with water and brought them back their drinks. 

 I was winning one out of every four pots and was the original 'good time Charlie' as I drank my water and acted as if I was getting blitzed. Three hours into the game and in the middle of a losing hand I did my pass out routine. Al got up and shook me and I played dead. 

 "He's out" Al said, "Help me get him to the couch. 

 Steve came over to help him while Mike took out his cell phone and made a call. "He's out" he said to whoever was on the other end. "Okay babe, see you in ten. She's on the way," he said to the group, "Let's finish the hand. Might even get in two more before she gets here." 

 Bob, who was playing with the group for the first time, asked what they were going to do about me. "Nothing" Al said, "He is what makes this thing work for us." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "Just wait young Bob, and be amazed." 

 Ten minutes later Hillary came in the front door and as it closed behind her I reached under the cushions for the remote that controlled the camera set up to cover the room. Hillary took one look at me and said, "Damn it guys, why do we have to go through this every time. You know you are supposed to set him on the couch so it looks like he's watching." 

 Steve and Bob came over and rearranged me so it looked like I was sitting there watching what was going on. While I was being positioned Hillary undressed and said, "Cut the cards to see who goes first." Al cut the high card and Hillary asked him, "What do you want lover?" 

 "I want your pussy doggie style." 

 Hillary moved around the table and through squinty eyes I could see her bend forward over the table so she could look at me at me while Al fucked her from behind. As All pushed his cock into her she moaned, "Oh yeah lover, push your cock into Chuck's wife. Push it deep lover, Chuckie's whore wants every fucking inch of your hard cock Fuck Chuckie's wife while he just sits there. Take me lover, take me hard in front of Chuckie." 

 It went on like that for several minutes and then Al gasped, "I'm cumming babe, I'm cumming." 

 "Yes, oh yes lover. Fill Chuckie's pussy full of cum." 

 Then it got repetitious as they all took turns fucking her. "Do you like it Chuck? Do you like sitting there while all your buddies gang fuck your wife? They are going to fill me full of cum Chuckie. My mouth, my pussy and my ass will be overflowing by the time they leave." 

 As soon as they had all had her once she told them to move me to the chair in the bedroom and as they came for me I hit the button on the remote for the camera in the bedroom. They carried me into the bedroom, sat me in the chair, and positioned it so I looked like I was watching again and then it got nasty. Al had his cock down Hillary's throat and Mike was in her cunt. Then Bob was in her ass while Steve was in her mouth. Next it was Joe in her ass while Al plowed her pussy then it was Bob in her pussy, Steve in her ass while Mike choked her with his bone. 

 For the next two hours all five of them were in Hillary in various combinations and all through it Hillary kept up with the monologue: 

 "Fill Chuck's wife with cum guys, load me up. Fuck Chuck's pussy and ass, fuck me hard, make Chuckie's wife cum." 

 By the end of two hours I'd had more than enough and then like a gift from the gods Hillary said: 

 "God, but I do so wish you could see this Chuck" as Mike stuffed her pussy and Bob rammed her ass. 

 I couldn't pass it up. I stood up and said, "I'm not God Hillary, but I can grant you your wish." 

 Hillary's face turned ashen and I didn't even bother looking at my so-called friends. I said to the room in general, "You all just go on having fun. I'm going into the den and start the termination paperwork on five soon to be ex- employees and one soon to be ex-wife" and I walked out of the room. 

 +++++ 

 With in five minutes I started hearing the front door open and close. Twenty minutes later Hillary came into the den wearing an old terry cloth robe. She sat down on the leather couch and watched me work on the computer. I ignored her and after about five minutes she said: 

 "You aren't really going to divorce me are you?" 

 "Of course I am." 

 "It would be a lot cheaper if you didn't." 

 "If you divorce me I'll have to get a lawyer and it will end up with me taking you to the cleaners. No divorce, no lawyer so it doesn't cost you." 

 "Why do you want to stay?" 

 "Because I love you." 

 "Yeah, right! That was certainly apparent to me to night." 

 "You just didn't understand what you saw." 

 "What's not to understand? You spent four hours fucking five of my so-called friends and disparaged and ridiculed me the entire time you did it." 

 "So what?" 

 "What do you mean, "so what?" 

 "I didn't mean a word of it and you should know that. By now you must have figured out that this wasn't the first time. Following any of your other poker games have you noticed any coolness, any lack of affection? No you haven't, but I do try to fuck your eyes out every chance I get. I love you Chuck, but I need more sex than any two or three men can provide. I've found that talking the way that I talked tonight fires up the men and they last longer. When you go out of town I always have one or two men over to keep me occupied and they are usually doing me when I talk to you on the phone, but it is not to disrespect you Chuck, it is merely something that fires them up and makes them go faster and stay longer. That's all it is Chuck, sex, not love, just sex. I love you and I don't care a lick about any of them." 

 "Doesn't change anything Hillary. I'm old fashioned about some things and one of them is that my wife is mine and as soon as she's not, she's not." 

 "Don't do this to yourself baby. I won't go quietly. The guys like my pussy and even though you can them they will still want it and I can get them to back me in court. It will be the six of us against the one of you and we will all swear that you were drunk out of your mind and imagined the whole thing. Let it be baby, just let it be and let me work on you. I'll prove to you I love you." 

 "You love me, but you are willing to go into court, perjure yourself and try and make me look like a hysterical fool? That doesn't compute Hillary." 

 "It is the only leverage I have to try and get you to drop this divorce thing. I don't want to do it Chuck, but if I push it far enough and hard enough I'm hoping I can get you to back down." 

 "Sorry Hillary, but you are damaged goods as far as I'm concerned." 

 "Okay baby, but don't say I didn't warn you." 

 "Okay Hillary, you warned me. Just be out of the house by the end of the day." 

 While she was in the shower I retrieved the cameras and took them into the den and played them. I had it all on tape and clear enough that you could identify all the players. I slept in the guest room and at six in the morning I left the house for my regular Saturday morning golf date, played eighteen holes and when I got home Hillary was gone. 

 +++++ 

 Hillary was gone and I sat down and made a list of what I needed to get done first thing Monday morning. I spent the rest of the weekend going through the house and packing up everything of Hillary's I could find and moved it out into the garage. I made three copies of the videotapes I had of the aftermath of the poker game and locked all of the tapes in the safe in my den. 

 Monday morning I terminated Bob, Joe, Al, Mike and Steve and set about hiring replacements for them. That afternoon I called the company lawyer and asked him to recommend a good divorce attorney and two days later I met with him. I told him the story and turned the two original tapes over to him and told him I wanted their existence kept secret as long as possible. I told him what Hillary had told me about getting all of my ex-friends together and get them to lie in court. I wanted the bastards to do it and then hit them with the tapes so I could see them nailed on perjury charges. 

 Hillary did what she said she would do - she made it as hard as she could. Acting on the theory that there can't be a divorce if the papers aren't served she disappeared. Six months went by and then I go t a phone call from her. 

 "Have you come to your senses yet? Have you missed me? Have you finally realized that I love you and don't want a divorce? Come on honey, we can talk it out and put it back together. I know we can." 

 I was right on the verge of hanging up on her when I had a brainstorm. "You are right, I do miss you, but I don't see how we can possibly get back together after what you did." 

 "That's why we need to talk honey." 

 "All right Hillary, when and where?" 

 "Can't I just come home?" 

 "I don't know about that." 

 "Please honey?" 

 "Well, I don't suppose it will hurt to try. When?" 

 "Tonight? The sooner the better." 

 "All right then, tonight, but I'm not promising anything." 

 I was watching from the front window when Hillary pulled into the drive and got out of her car and I watched as the man got out of the car parked across the street and intercepted Hillary on the front walk and served her with the divorce papers. After he walked away she came up the walk to the front porch and I met her at the door. She waved the papers at me, "That was cold." 

 "It got the job done." 

 "So you aren't going to talk with me?" 

 "Nothing to say that hasn't already been said." 

 "It doesn't matter to you that I love you and I don't want a divorce from you?" 

 "No, you said it yourself the night I busted you. You said you needed more sex than any two or three men can give you and I will not stay married to a whore. Do I miss you? Hell yes, but that doesn't change the fact that you cheated on me wholesale and with a bunch of assholes who were supposed to be my friends. I'd never trust you again and I can't live with some one I can't trust."

"If you don't pull those divorce papers Chuck I'll ruin you. I don't want to, but I'll do what I have to do to stop this divorce." 

 "I'm going to say this just once Hillary. Go into court with those assholes and lie and I'll ruin every one of you. So far all that stabbing me in the back has cost them is their jobs. If they go in with you and lie I'll make you all pay." 

 Hillary started to say something else, but I closed the door on her. 

 +++++ 

 Hillary got a lawyer and the dance began. Her lawyer demanded and my lawyer countered and this went on for a while with neither side giving an inch and finally it went to court. I told my side and then Hillary and the Asshole Five got up and told the story that she said they would tell. The judge said it sounded like a "He said, she said" situation only she had back up and I didn't. At that point my lawyer said we has all the back up we needed and he produced the tapes and several prints that had been captured from the tapes and the audio tape from the conference room. The judge hauled both attorneys, Hillary and me into his chambers and started to ream our asses for not getting all of the garbage out of the way before coming into his court. 

 "You had the tapes and you could have disclosed that you had them and not have had to drag this farce into my courtroom." 

 At that point I interrupted the judge and told him I wouldn't let my lawyer disclose. 

 "I wanted everyone to see what lying scum Hillary and my five ex-friends were and the only way to do that was get them into court and let them lie in front of God and everybody and then prove them liars." 

 The judge called a recess and I left the courtroom and made a phone call. That afternoon a messenger service delivered copies of everything I had to the wives of the five assholes and to Hillary's mother, father, sisters, brother and her two living grandparents. 

 +++++ 

 That was three months ago and the divorce is final. Hillary left the marriage with only what she brought into it - her maiden name. Steve was somehow able to save his marriage, but the other four are in divorce court and they are not going to make out near as well as I did. I haven't heard a word from Hillary since she called me up the day after our day in court and called me every rotten name she could think of. 

 "How could you be so low as to send that stuff to my family?" 

 "I warned you that if you lied in court I would ruin you. You should have known me well enough to know that I would carry through on my threat. You lied, and I saw to it that you paid for that lie" and I hung up on her. 

 I'm rid of her and I suppose I should be glad, but why do I think about her all the time and why do I feel so damned miserable? Report_Story
