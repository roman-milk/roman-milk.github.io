 ****** That First Call ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© ========================= 

 You gave him your number. He wants to talk. 

 This is my first foray into audio stories. This one's for the ladies. Please let me know what you think, and I'd love as much feedback as I can get, as to what works and what doesn't. 

 Let me know what you like, what you don't, what you'd like to hear from me (if anything!), and any issues with the recording itself. 

 Thanks.

 ========================= 

 You're at home, tired of the same old routine. Playing the part of the good little woman. Always well behaved. Publicly conservative. A paragon of virtue. 

 Until yesterday. 

 I know. I know how hard it was for you to give me your phone number, to take a chance. I could feel you trembling as I cornered you. Leaning against you, my body touching yours. I made sure you felt how much I wanted you. 

 Because I can see you. The real you. You try to hide it away. I imagine it works most of the time. Were you surprised when I saw through your subterfuge? Past the nice girl facade. 

 I'll be honest, I didn't expect to see someone like you there. Not in a million years. I'll confess, I watched you for quite a long time. Studied you from afar. How you held yourself, the way you kept your distance from those pretenders, the way you laughed, your little gestures. I saw everything. How you stood, the way your eyes scanned the room. The boredom you withstood, playing your part. Always the proper little woman. 

 That might have been it, if you hadn't glanced my way. The way our eyes locked, that little smirk you wore, as if you knew what I was thinking. Like I was one of them. 

 But I'm not, am I? 

 You resisted, I'll give you that much. You tried to maintain your image, play it cool. But you didn't fool me. It was only a few intimate touches at first. A shared joke, laughing at the fools surrounding us. We're two of a kind in so many ways. I just don't hide it. 

 For a moment I thought I'd lost you, when you looked across the room. You turned away briefly, but I don't give up easily. I stayed with you, followed you out of sight, cornered you there. Your breasts gave you away you know. The way they rose and fell, I could sense your excitement. Leaning against you, I felt that tiny shudder. I saw the goosebumps, the desire in your eyes. 

 I don't know why you try to hide it. Anyone who knows what to look for can see the furnace raging inside you. Your sultry lips, begging for attention, capable of so much. The way your tongue peeked out, wetting them for me. Were you even aware of what you were doing? I know I was. 

 One kiss. That's all I got from you. That one, heart-stopping kiss, that sent shivers down my spine. Those few seconds when all I suspected about you was revealed. 

 One short kiss, and your phone number. That's why I have to call you today. 

 I suspect that one kiss is also why you'll pick up the phone when I do call.
